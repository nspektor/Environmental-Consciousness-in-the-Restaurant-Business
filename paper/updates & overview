1. Defining restaurant success (features to look at)

- Does the restaurant offer a unique experience, (ie. unique food, unique presentation of food, unique decorations, unique music, etc)
- Does the restaurant generate traffic during slow times? Perhaps by offering special promotions during off-peak times.
- Does the restaurant receive good ratings & positive reviews? (Yelp 'highly recommended')
- Is the restaurant clean? (inspection grade, rat calls in area, yelp reviews about clean/dirty)
- Does the restaurant offer quality food? (Yelp reviews, check to mention 'quality', 'hair in food', 'plastic', 'fresh', 'organic', 'smell')
- Does the restaurant have multiple locations? Has it expanded? How many customers does it have? (can give us insight to how much money it has to pay its employees)
- Is the restaurant part of GRA (with high grade) or Seafood Watch?

2. Data sources:
-Yelp
-GRA
-Seafood Watch


3. Cleaned data using Pandas Python -
+54 Restaurants (NY) -- which data source is this from? 

**GRA:**

Green restaurants in NY / Total # of restaurants:
78 / 603

**Yelp data:**

# of Businesses in NY / Total # of businesses:

Restaurants in NY / Total Restaurants:

**Overview of plan & next steps:**

- join business reviews
- separate into training (GRA) and test data (not GRA)
- Preprocessing:
- run TFIDF --> K-means

- Deploy, visualize, etc

**Future potential steps:**
Prove/show correlation does Green =?= Success
