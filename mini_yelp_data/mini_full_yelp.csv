After browsing the menu and a brief discussion with our waiter  we ordered seafood noodles and a 3 item mix meat plate (BBQ pork  chicken  and duck)\n\nThe food came soon thereafter and it was hot and delicious.  There was large portions and lots of seafood in the seafood noodles and the mix meat plate came with good cuts of meat and the correct sauces.\n\nAfter the meal  we received fortune cookies for dessert.\n\n\nFood\nThe food was good quality.  Ingredients tasted fresh and dishes tasted well made.  Food is above average but nothing stood out even though I was quite hungry.\n\nPrice\nPrice is high in comparative to other Chinese cuisine  and comparable to large western restaurant chains.\n\nService:\nThe service is average to slightly below average.  A common malaise of chinese restaurants is poor service where the waiter/waitresses are overworked  impatient  unattentive.  Emerald Chinese is no exception.  The waiting staff at the restaurant appear rushed and impatient.  All our services needs were met  but the staff was rushed and grumpy..\n\nDecor\nEmerald has tasteful decorations  comfortable chairs and nice tablecloths.  There is sufficient room to navigate between tables.\n\n\nOverall  we had a good meal with large portions  received average service and paid slightly more than we had hoped for our meal.\n\n3.1 / 5.0', ""We've always been there on a Sunday so we were hoping that Saturday dim sum would be less busy. No such luck. We were surprised that some of the dishes were cold because it was so packed; I could understand if it was empty and the carts weren't circulating but every table was full. It took a while to get drinks and other items (napkins). The dishes were not of the same quality as they had been on other visits  but they were acceptable."", '***No automatic doors  not baby friendly!*** I frequent this Chinese restaurant before and post partum. Dim sum is ok  dishes at dinner time are huge  service is great  BUT there are no automatic doors! How am in supposed to push my stroller inside?!!!', ""Horrible service \nI went there tonight with my boyfriend because he;s passed by the place a couple of times and we wanted to try it out. We orders bok choy  chicken fried rice and some lemon chicken. When we got our food the chicken was hard and looked old like it had been refried. So i complained to the server  he didn't even acknowledge my complaint and just left. i told another server and he told me that  this is how they make it and left without even offering to provide a new one. Finally  a women server offered to get a new one and even agreed with us that it was old. But it took about 20 minutes and all we had was the rice and bok choy. By the time they brought it out we just weren't hungry anymore  considering we did not want to eat the chicken by itself and our rice was already cold. Only exception is the sweet older lady who served us the rest of servers were rude. One server  even went to the table beside us to check the bill to see how much tip a couple had gave after they left. We heard him mention tip as he looked at the bill and threw it back down angry. Disgusting  will not return."", ""One of the gauges of a good Chinese restaurant is the number of Chinese people who patronize the place. Emerald Chinese Restaurant has a lot of patrons.\n\nMy wife and I mainly come for the dim sum  brunch (9:00 AM ~ 11:00 AM) on weekends. The food is great  the place is clean  and there is ample parking around the restaurant. From within the restaurant  you can easily see outside as three of the four walls are made of glass. This gives the place a sense of airiness that some places we go to do not.\n\n*The ideal time to come on weekends is between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM. Come before 10 AM and not all the food is available yet. Come after 11 AM  expect to fall in line. \n\nThe staff is efficient  but do not expect a lengthy conversation. For a place like this  this is not a put down. It's what I expect.\n\nThe quality of the dim sum is comparable to what you'd get in a good Hong Kong dim sum restaurant. The hot food is mostly brought out in steamer carts which means that it reaches your table hot and fresh. Fried foods and dessert items do not come in the steamer carts. The turnaround is pretty quick (a food cart seems to be depleted every two rounds of the tables) so very seldom is the food going around for too long. My personal favorites are the sweet pork - served either in a steamed bun or in flaky pastry  chicken feet  shrimp - served in a dumpling or the white rice wrap  pork and century egg congee  and the douhua (silken tofu) with syrup. My wife loves the giant oyster served on its shell with garlic and glass noodles.\n\nThere may be a few fancier places out there but if fancy is not that important to you  then this place is difficult to beat."", ""I've been a frequent at this place for years  enough that the managers pretty much recognize my whole family. And I have to say  this is probably my favorite Chinese place for lunch.\n\nFirst of all  the place is HUGE. My relatives have booked this place as a venue for weddings  events  gatherings  and we usually get a good experience. On some days when you come at a busy time  it's not that bad of a wait because of how many tables there are! I remember waiting in a line past the door a few times to be seated  but maybe this has changed?\n\nFOOD! I honestly think it's great here  though it is a bit expensive for what it offers. I prefer the lunch dim sum  letting them wheel carts as you take your pick. It's nice because I'm definitely not a decisive person  so I usually just get the tastiest looking stuff on the carts. A favorite is the crap shrimp ball things (? lol)  the siu mai  dumplings  they're all very good. I also love the green vegetable plates or the scallops here  they're cooked well and I've never had any rubbery or overcooked meat.\n\nSERVICE is all pretty good too imo  a lot of the cart ladies speak broken English and a bit of a Vietnamese so it's not too hard for us. They're usually fast too  bringing drinks/sauces/plates when we ask right away. \n\n\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to people! The reason it's a 4 is because I find the dinner experience to be a bit disappointing; often our dishes are just warm or sometimes cool when we order them. However  I love coming back at lunch  I think the dim sum is a fun and tasty experience. Actually I go almost every week and I've not noticed any drop in quality  so this place will probably remain my goto Chinese lunch for now!"", 'We chose this restaurant for our Chinese New Year dinner. The menu has a wide variety of dishes. The service was par. We order the pre fix menu and some side dishes . The waiter was at first not acoomendating but after a discussion with my dad they agreed on what we asked for. The food was mediocre to good. Most dishes were hot and tasty besides a few that were a bit salty. Overall the experience was good.', ""I went at 230 on a Monday. It was dimsum \n\nI hated every second I was there  the carts were going around but the ladies kept ignoring us and I don't understand why. \n\nwe got gar how & a spinach dumpling. \n\nAfter that not a single cart were go by and we sat for so long till I finally I gave up \n\nwe went to pay and it was 14$ which is soooo high for what we got ...... \n\nI'll never ever go back ..\n\n.. food was good though"", ""My family and I were at Emerald yesterday during the busiest point of dim sum traffic. All I can say is  it is total mayhem. There weren't any lines during the time we were there  but I believe that is because they churn through customers in a manner I have never seen before. The tables are smooshed together to get as many in and out quickly. I can't really blame them  I get it. When you have a good thing  capitalize on it. Though  this atmosphere creates a bit of a frantic assembly line feel that I don't particularly find enjoyable.\n\nThere is no denying that the food at Emerald is pretty good. When it comes to dim sum  they stand out among the rest as they offer way more options than any other restaurant. Their offerings are unique and plentiful in size but not in overall temperature of dish. Only 1 of the dishes we received were actually the temperature it needed to be. Again  a symptom of the style of restaurant. \n\nService was perfunctory at best. Cart servers were like street corner merchants hawking their wares. Actually placing items on the table while explaining why you simply needed to have it (in as few words as possible).\n\nOverall  3 stars is being a little more generous than I should be. But the food is actually not bad."", ""Because we are in Mississauga  I think this place is pretty good compare to other dim sum places around the area. Me and my family used to come here a lot  but nowadays we all so busy that we come here less.\n\nThe dim sums here aren't as fancy as the one in Mississauga China Town  but I don't mind the look. I just mind about the taste.\n\nTips: only a few dim sum need to order. Most of them are pushed out."", ""Whenever I go here on the weekend  this place is super busy.  Expect to wait about 30 minutes for a table.  This place is also mutli-ethnic.  You will see people of all different races coming here.  This place is one of the chinese dim sum restaurants that white people like to come to.  \n\nThe food is decent  but it is pricey.  You can find much cheaper dim sum places elsewhere  but if you don't speak chinese you will be more comfortable coming here. \n\nSometimes  depending on what time you come here  there will be barely any food coming around. \n\nDerek"", 'Came on a weekday morning with bf to avoid the weekend crowds and we definitely enjoyed our experience here\n\nFood: 5/5\nOrdered a bunch our staples: lotus leaf wrapped sausage and sticky rice  preserved egg congee  egg yolk bun. And they were all pretty bomb!\nEmployees were walking around with carts full of dim sums. Super Cantonese style\nSome items in the cart are off the menu\n\nService: 5/5\nSuper friendly and funny staffs.Willing to explain everything despite the language barrier.\n\nEnvironment: 3/5\nBit outdated\nLobby and washroom are particularly sketchy\n\nOverall 4/5  will return!\nAnd we were told on weekends  there are a more variety of dim sums', ""Despite the poor service here  my family comes here for special occasions because the quality of their dishes is pretty decent. There is a wide variety of dishes and you can also order a 10-course meal if you'd like. The dim sum menu is also very selective.\n\nBut as mentioned the service is terrible! You'll expect to wait 20-30 mins for your food especially if you come with a large group. I know you cant expect good service from an asian restaurant but I'm used to the quick eat in and out type of meal and it's definitely subpar service here! The waiters are also not very friendly and give you attitude when you ask when your food is coming.\n\nI only give this restaurant 2 stars because the ambience of the restaurant is nice and the quality/selection of food is good."", ""The dimsum here is actually alright. Food was good relative to its price. Servers were nice despite language barriers. Nicely lit and seemingly tidy/clean environment  with beautiful decor. Wasn't the best dimsum I've tasted  but it was good."", 'This is one of the few bigger chinese restaurants in mississauga. They have solid good food. Although in recent visits  the service has been lacking... \nMy family and I always come here for birthdays  holiday and recently Chinese New Year dinner. \n\nIn those few times  the service of our food has taken a very long time. The food does not arrive until 20-30 minutes after ordering. Not only that but they did not provide the starter soup. \n\nWhen we question the servers about the wait time  we received some lip. It was only when the managers came to serve us the service was a bit better. \n\nEmerald overall is a great restaurant  but next time we might take our family business elsewhere!', ""We have been going here to eat for years  whether it is a celebration or just a regular night out for dinner.\nI always continue to go here  yes the service isn't that great but I won't complain about the service  the place is always extremely busy and I think that speaks for itself...food never disappoints  dim sum  delivery  fresh authentic Chinese food.."", ""Good dim sum  not too expensive  out in Mississauga but worth the trip. \n\nOur family spent many Sunday brunches here and I always love going with a big group so we can order a larger variety.\n\nI think it's consistently good  not consistently great but good and clean and busy which means the food is usually fresh. When I lived in Taipei we would never eat anywhere where there wasn't a wait because that meant the food usually sat around. Which is a policy I usually stick to for Chinese Restaurants. \n\nI'm giving it 4 stars mainly because if I want dim sum in Toronto it's usually the place I think of first. But really maybe it should be 3.5?\n\nNot sure about the service or non-dim sum menu so this review is just for dim sum.\n\nI like anything with bbq pork  especially the bbq pork wrapped in thin sheets of rice noodle  and baked bbq pork buns. I also love the rice noodles with a side of xo sauce  wrapped sticky rice  Chinese broccoli and deep fried sticky rice ball with sesame or red bean paste and egg tarts for dessert.\n\nNot sure how useful these descriptions are because I only know the Chinese names so I'm describing the dishes... sorry but if you've been to dim sum before you might be able to figure it out. Next time I go I'll try to update the names."", ""Traditional and authentic Dim Sum!!! I couldn't believe I walked in a 3pm on a weekday and there were carts full of dim sum!!! Lots to choose from and new dumplings I never tried! Mighty impressed by taste but when the bill came I was shocked!! $30 for 5 items. Ah  well  ya live once! I'm going back!"", 'Poor service  overpriced food.  Make sure to check your dim sum bill.  They tried cheating me and making things more expensive.  Very dishonest business and would not go back.', ""This is the second time I've ever been here and I was quickly reminded why I didn't come back after the first time. I came on a weekend after the lunch rush so the restaurant wasn't busy at all. Most of the dim sum I ordered I noticed was just pulled from a sitting cart so it needed to be warmed up - I believe they had to microwave it! The food is normal. You can get the same taste and quality type food at other dim sum restaurants and pay literally half the price. Some dim sum items are $6 a plate which I don't think is justifiable at all when I can get the same dish and portion size elsewhere for half the cost. I almost fell off my chair when my $70 bill for 2 people arrived at the table. I won't be returning here and wouldn't recommend my friends to go here. It's way overpriced."", 'Food is really good  the place is super busy during the weekend. I love it. Remembers me China :)\n\nBut I find the price too high for what it is. I still highly recommend this place.', ""We saw that the rating was not that high  but decided to stop by anyways. A lot of Chinese restaurants with great food but poor service often suffer on yelp ratings  but the food here was not good enough to balance out the bad service.\n\nWe got there at around noon on a weekday and it was pretty full. It took a few minutes for someone to seat us. We ordered some dishes from the carts but realized we had no utensils. It took about ten minutes for us to wave someone over to bring us some. Although the guy who seated us asked us what tea we wanted  he never brought it by and it took another ten or so minutes for us to get someone's attention.\n\nWe got beef changfen  shrimp dumplings  spinach moon dumplings  curry octopus and meatballs. The skin on the dumplings and changfen was soft but too thick for the amount of filling inside. The meatballs were flavorful but not very tender. Only the octopus had both flavor and texture."", ""My family(15+ ppl) and I came yesterday to celebrate a baptism and my birthday. We got there and the reservation was under my uncles' name and they already choosed and paid for the dishes they selected for each table.  The waitress was badgering us appetizers/soups but we didn't know that it was extra.... most of it didn't taste really good especially the tripe/liver which made me gag.The basic Chinese food like the sizzling beef  mushrooms  chow mein was really good though. However  the lack of customer service pissed me off. My relative was going to pay but the amount of money they charged was crazy and they added dishes we didn't even have; the manager literally got up in my uncle's face yelling at him and his wife and made her cry by telling them that they're going to call the police. That is not how you treat a customer.  We are never going back because of how we were treated. Overall: the food gets a 3/5 and customer service gets -2/5. I hope they don't treat other customers like that."", ""I would say Emeralds has worsen over a period of few months  honestly  the service here was never the greatest  but now it has gotten to the point where the employees barely know any english! \n\nAlso  they served us with dumplings that have gone bad  and were very sour in taste.  Meh  I wouldn't really care however  they charged us for it?!? So I have to pay to eat dumplings that may prove to be a health concern?  \n\n...At least the washrooms were clean... :P"", ""The dim sum here is really good.  There was a huge lineup on Sunday.  There was alot of variety.  More than many other dim sum restaurants.  if you are close to the airport  this will be a great place to go for dim sum in Mississauga.  It's only about 20min from the Toronto airport.  There is not alot of push carts left in the Toronto area.  Their prices are reasonable.  Four people can be really full on $50 for lunch.  \n\nI used to live in Mississauga and this was one of the better restaurants in the area.  If it's a weekend  you'll have to wait at least half an hour at lunch.  If you only have 2 people you might get a table right away.  They have a few 2 people table that no one uses.  Most people come here in groups of 4 or more."", 'I\'ve been here a quite a few times over the last two or three years and something has definitely changed. The quality of the food has gone down hill and the prices are ridiculous! \n\nToday I went with my husband for lunch and we were disappointed! The food was cold and on four occasions after we ordered the dim sum  the woman said ""okay let me warm it up for you"" and proceeded to the back to microwave it! What the heck?! Why are they pushing around cold dishes?\n\nWhen we asked for shrimp rice rolls  the waiter put in the order to the kitchen - we thought ""great! at least it will be fresh"". Well... when they came out we wanted to send it back. The roll was gummy and falling apart. Not pleasant at all. \n\n$40 for seven dishes  four of them microwaved  one of them barely edible - just not a good meal. Should have gone to Manchu Wok.', 'I usually come here when nothing else is open  especially during holidays. It takes forever to get your food  especially take out. I usally get there seafood and beef fried rice. Nothing special. Service isnt that great either.. but its the only place open during xmas and new years lol', 'I usually really like the dim sum here but my lunch here yesterday was a real letdown. We came right before 2pm so maybe the timing something to do with it but I\'m told their dim sum is on till 4pm.\n\nThe har gow was the worst I\'ve ever had  and I rarely get to say that about har gow. The shrimp was tiny  rubbery  and it tasted ""off"". I was just glad we didn\'t get sick off it. It tasted completely different from how they used to do it here so I\'m not sure if they used a bad batch  but if so it shouldn\'t have been served in the first place. Another staple  the shiu mai  was also pretty bad. It was tasty usually but it was tiny and I\'m not sure if it had any fish egg topping either. If it did  it wasn\'t noticeable. The shiu mai here used to be huge but it seems the owner is shrinking it every single year. Even the bbq pork rice roll was disappointing  there were tiny slivers of bbq pork in it. We also ordered some fried pork & veggie dumpling that was actually served to us cold. The lady pushing the cart never bothered to heat it back up for us I guess. Stuff like this should be basic! The only dishes I liked were the steamed choy sum with oyster sauce. The xiao long bao was also decent.\n\nOverall  it seems like they\'re skimping on everything that costs money now. Despite that  prices are higher than other dim sum spots. That\'s not a good combination. I hope the owner recognizes this soon because it\'d be a shame for one of the few good dim sum spots in the city to keep on this path.', 'Food was awesome but the service was horrible. I felt like I had to hunt someone down to order items. Might try one more time due to the food being delicious.', ""This is THE place for Dim Sum in Mississauga. Don't despair if you see a huge line up at the door on weekends  things move quickly. There is no rhyme or reason to the hostess numbering system...so just wait your turn knowing that it is going to be great food. The food is cooked in steamer baskets and walked around the restaurant on carts. Someone at your table has to take the key ordering position so as to flag down the cart and get the food on the table. The food runs out quickly  so don't wait for it to come around again  it may be a while or never! They do a great job with the staple DS fare: Har gow (shrimp dumplings)  Shui Mai (pork) and sticky rice. My personal favourite is the scallops with garlic sauce. Try the Chinese greens  dumpling soup  and pork sesame seed buns. The spring rolls ( with meat filling) are awesome as well.\nThe best time to go is just before noon on weekends or on weekdays. Anytime after 2:00 p.m. is pointless as they will be out of most food items."", 'this place is the best place to get dim sum ! the food is delicious and the staff is always welcoming and attentive to our needs  the only thing im not crazy about it the washrooms  and anyone who knows me knows I like to see how clean a place is based on the cleanliness of their bathrooms', 'the service in this place is poooor hands down as is the case with most chinese restaurants  but the food is good and well priced. if u can handle lack of service but good food this place is for you. went there for dinner and it wasnt that busy but the service was but food was good and well sized portions', 'This is your standard dim sum however its a bit more expensive than other dim sum locations in the area.

I would have preferred ordering from a menu  but co-workers who aren't dim sum regulars like the push-cart style so they can peek before ordering \n\nSelection -- good  aplenty on seafood dishes (steamed shrimp dumpling  steamed shrimp with chives dumpling  fried shrimp dumpling  fried shrimp with chives dumpling  .... you get the gist). They have all the usual suspects for dim sum. \n\nQuality -- okay. Because it's always busy  we've not had un-fresh food. \n\nService -- so so. I think they try to be efficient  if not warm and attentive. The servers are always in such a rush  who's got time to smile at or chat with you?! If you want something  just be assertive and flag someone down (in a polite way). \n\nWait Time -- avoid 11:45 - 12:45 peak lunch time. Otherwise finding a parking and getting a table will taste your patience."", ""I'm writing this update based on the lunch I had here today. \n\nI'm so annoyed that the service is so incredibly rude. I can understand that they might be busy  and need to move fast. Sometimes they respond to me  but they look the other way  I'm okay with that too. \n\nBut today we went  and I would ask people for tea  and cutlery and things  and they would put a grump face and storm away  only to come back with the minimal amount of things. \n\nI mean  we asked for hot sauce  and he just  violently squeezed hot sauce in everyone's bowls! I was shocked  and then so I asked for more bowls. And he stomped off and brought me just one bowl. (What about everyone else)\n\nSome other servers are quite nice. If you need anything  try to flag down the guy in the suit/tie or the ladies in the black blazers. Anyone else will just throw things at you (figuratively)\n\nThey also again  tried to put stuff on our table  and I had to tell them to take it back. When she was confused what i wanted  I got yelled at. \n\nI think if you are a regular and they get to know you the service would be better. It would be the managers serving you  not the others. \n\nNonetheless  the place is always packed full of the local asian folk  which is a good thing. I can understand why  it's cheap  and the food is quite decent (they can cook the short ribs a bit more).  This time with 5 people  we paid $11 a person. \n\nIf it wasn't for the only dim sum place in proximity  and my co-workers loving it so much  I wouldn't come back. \nI really don't need to be treated like a 2nd class citizen."", ""Years ago  they were great.

I tried some of those foods that the workmates had called up on the table as we were haring the bills and everything from the rice  to the chicken  to every single thing was terrible!

You could order it too  but that can take some time.  \n\n2)  The quality:  Sometimes it\'s good  sometimes it\'s meh.  It\'s rarely excellent. \n\n3)  The wait:  OMGoodness.  On a Sunday morning at noon  you can expect a hefty wait especially if you\'re in a group larger than 4.  I don\'t even attempt Saturday morning.  I\'d have to assume that the rush dies down after 2 pm but don\'t quote me on that!\n\nI\'d say it\'s a good place to go if you\'re a dim sum newb and you like to see the items before you order them.  But otherwise there are better options out there.', ""I LOVE dim sum  and this place does it RIGHT. The dishes are consistently good. The only problem might be in dealing with the servers that don't speak English. If you look asian and can't speak Cantonese or Mandarin  they look at you like you are from another planet.

I just don't like the washrooms or the hallway to the washroom  looks sketchy. There's fish tanks with crab and other seafood...alive tho. And it right along where people sit down  and sometimes the one of the staff comes along and takes a fish out of the tank with a fishnet  that's the only thing I don't like...why couldn't they put this anywhere else?

Food is never far away  if you see something that you like you'd better get it because the place is packed and it might not be there the next time the cart comes around.

Thankfully there is quite an amazing variety of foods and it is fresh. I loved the octopus as well as the wonton. Chicken feet were available so the wife was impressed.

Although the decor is nice with bright lights  white tablecloths and golden chair covers  it\'s ultimate downfall is the food. \n\nThe majority of dim sum items were deep fried. Where were the steamed bamboo baskets and rice noodle rolls? Cart upon cart  of fried food came by multiple times before we even had one rice noodle roll cart. Even the rice noodle roll was disappointing. Good rice noodle rolls have a very thin skin. These were very thick. \n\nI asked one woman pushing a cart what dumplings she had and she said one was a ""shrimp biscuit"". I was dismayed to find it was one tiny shrimp no bigger than my thumb completely surrounded by ground pork.\n\nThe staff were awful. Apart from yelling at each other from across the room  they were curt when we asked for more hot water and they were not very nice. \n\nOne cart lady got impatient and annoyed when we called her over to our table after she skipped us. After asking for the fried noodles on her cart  she stamped our card  then said she would get us a warm plate. She disappeared  and we didn\'t see her again. We were about to ask someone about this  when another lady came with a plate of noodles. They were microwaved!!!! \n\nI think it\'s safe to say I\'ll never come back here again.

It was extremely packed - a pretty long wait time I would assume. Luckily there are perks to being regulars at this restaurant: less wait time  attentive service  and the tea surcharge is waived. \n\nI generally go here because of the hustle & bustle atmosphere and because the dim sum is relatively consistent in quality. Is it the best dim sum I ever tasted? Probably not  but I still enjoy it because it's still one of the best  most popular  and packed Chinese restaurants in Mississauga (it's always nice to go to a busy restaurant versus a completely dead one in my opinion - it indicates food is always made fresh for customers). If you want the most authentic dim sum experience in this side of town  this place is it! There's not many other restaurants that can wheel out fresh & hot food in carts throughout the entire lunch period (many other similar restaurants you have to order off a sheet  so it may take away from the experience if you've never tried this).\n\nIf you've never been to dim sum  I think going here would be a good experience. It's nice to have some prior knowledge of some Chinese food if possible. Some of the dishes I order regularly are: XO stir fried rice noodle rolls  spare ribs in black bean sauce  fried crab claw (a bit expensive  ~$5 for 2 but a guilty pleasure for sure)  fried seaweed roll.\n\nOnly negatives about this place could be: long wait times  not for people who dislike busy/loud environments  not for extremely starving people (you might have to wait if you can't find something you like right away on a cart)  specialty/large dishes are expensive  not very wheelchair accessible (I still found a way but the general layout of the restaurant/plaza isn't that friendly for wheelchairs)"", 'Nothing special esp for toronto.

Came with house soup (老火湯) and dessert (綠豆沙 and orange slices).\n\nThe braised beef was very good  if not a bit oily. The brisket was fall apart tender and the tendon was perfectly cooked - not too mushy and not too crunchy. The inclusion of snow pea shoots was a bit of an unexpected choice of vegetable (I would have expected a root vegetable  like carrots or turnips)  but the snow pea shoots ended up being a nice counterbalance to the rich braising liquid.\n\nThe eggs were a bit uneven  with some parts being of perfect consistency and the other parts being a touch overcooked. The seafood (shrimp and scallop) was plentiful and tasty. My only complaint was that the eggs were quite oily (but it\'s kind of to be expected with this dish).\n\nThe house soup was a traditional slow cooked carrot and green turnip soup with preserved mandarin peel and the dessert a standard mung bean soup.\n\nService was on the slow side and they were stingy with the tea leaves. \n\nPrices were reasonable.\n\nOverall an OK option for traditional Cantonese food for local residents... but there are better options if you go more west and obviously WAY better options if you\'re willing to go all the way east to Markham/Scarborough/etc.', ""Whenever my friend and I are in the mood for dim sum  we come here for their discounted dim sum times (9am-11am  2pm-4pm).

For Dim Sum it seems that you need to make yourself very visible in order to get served. Occupied ladies wheel the carts around with no set predictability or pattern.

In March this year  I walked into the men's room to find a floor covered in vomit! In most restaurants  this would be cleaned up immediately.\n\nFrom Day 1  I felt the rudeness and aggression from the wait staff.

This means you will have food thrown at you from all the servers  YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO SAY NO IF YOU DON'T WANT IT. \n\nThere are carts of food making rounds of the huge seating area and they all have different foods on them. Yes sometimes you will see the same cart multiple times  you just have to be patient.

I had no idea what 90% of the food was. Luckily  the friends I went with knew what was going on and ordered for us all. The food is different  so you will have to pass your comfort zone and try new things. Sometimes the food looked like things I'd find growing between my toenails  but tasted like heaven should taste.

We said yes  but then realized that she was just going to reheat the ones on the actual cart  that were sitting by the front door. The ribs were lukewarm and the wings were soggy from the reheat.  \n\nNow  as for the menu... If you eat in as opposed to takeout  there is a price hike  supposedly because you are getting more food  so don't be surprised by the $15 chicken fried rice and about the same for curry vegetables.\n\nThe rice was just plain crap.

If I could give 0 star  that's what it deserves."", 'This is as close as you can get to Hong Kong dim sum here in Mississauga.\n\nI have been eating here for almost 10 years. Surprisingly I managed to write my review just now so I\'m a little behind. The place is huge - banquet style seating. They are open pretty early in the morning and close very late at night so it\'s very convenient for a Chinese restaurant in the west GTA.\n\nThe choice is yours: Pick up dim sum from the carts slowly strolling in the aisles or order from their menu. From their ""Har Gau"" shrimp dumplings to their simple Rice Toppings  you can always find something good to eat here. When I first arrived at Emerald  I didn\'t quite know what to expect. It was busier than a shopping mall on a snowy weekend and I probably felt extremely overwhelmed by all the people waiting in the front lobby. What I have always learned is that if the restaurant is filled with patrons of its own nationality then the chances are that the food is very good and trustworthy. I am telling you all  the food is very good here.\n\nDim sum carts: Depending on the type of food that you pick out will justify the price you must pay. Noodles and veggies are cheaper. Seafood items are higher in cost. If you love seafood as much as I do  you won\'t mind paying for it.\n\nMenu: I have eaten several items on the list here for dinner and they all taste great. If you order the crab  it can get quite expensive so choose wisely based on your budget. When dining here with out-of-town family or friends  I would always recommend buying the crab.\n\nSo what has put off many people is the very rough service treatment. You need to keep in mind that delicious Cantonese style food does not equal to quality service. As many people have often complained that it can and will be extremely busy during weekends and holidays  I\'m listing several tips for all of you to enjoy the ""five-star"" eating experience.\n\nTip #1: Plan wisely - Weekend dim sum lunch hours is crazy busy and holidays is even worse. Unless you are absolutely craving their food  beware of rushed and rude service.\nTip #2: All your favourite dim sum dishes may or may not be on the carts. You can order dim sum dishes straight from the kitchen for the same price. But be prepared to wait at least 15 minutes for your order to come out. The same can be said about ordering menu items during dim sum hours. I have seen people walk out because their order never arrived after eating several dim sum dishes.\nTip #3: When you need some service  get their attention! Make eye contact and call over the staff wearing black vests. They are the ones you need to order from so don\'t be shy and call them over. \nTip #4: When asking for something  no need to be rude to them even though they are rude to you. When speaking with us needy/hungry/polite Canadians during busy times they are very direct because they are trying to keep up with orders. Just say what you need and follow up when they forget. If you ask for too many things then they will make you feel unwelcome.\n\nFor more food reviews and blogging  check out my blog at https://spicychopsticks.blog', ""We came all the way from New York to try this restaurant because it was recommended by some friends.  However  this is the worst Cantonese restaurant I've ever been to.  We went there for lunch. Food was so bad -- the beef tasted like it was marinated in some kind of chemicals.  I had pretty bad diarrhea after eating at this place.  Price was expensive and service was lousy.

They also took that extra step by taking out a binder  with coloured photos  in order to try to identify the particular item.  This gets them extra points!\n\nOur table ordered so much that we were given 10% discount.\n\nWould get more *s if the washrooms matched with the rest of the dining room.  Food is alright  I guess fancy dining room AND more selection tricks people into thinking that food is better than it actually is  but I find it just alright."", ""What a joke.

The portions are huge  absolutely delicious and cooked fresh  and the prices are extremely reasonable! I ordered the Sautéed jumbo shrimp and grilled vegetables as a healthy option  and the shrimp was delicious! It was perfectly cooked  very light  very big  very yummy  and there was so much of it I struggled to finish. My boyfriend ordered the sweet & sour chicken with noodles and they were both great.

I miss that. Given  I guess you have to strategize to know what\'s fresh or not. \n\nThe food was okay. Not spectacular. but very good. A great place to come for a work celebration or work lunch.  The clientel is mostly local Chinese folk  or people that work near by. \n\nThey are SO aggressive here! On many of an occasion they would put plates on our table  and say ""here  you like this!"" We\'re like...no  thanks  full ""No! you like this!"" And when I say no a second time  they take it back (one of them was ever grumbling how we didn\'t want vegetables!)\nIt\'s like they make a commission here or something. \nI would suggest  know what you want  and don\'t succumb to their ploys. \n\nThey are super busy around here  so don\'t be afraid of putting up your hand and flagging someone down. \n\ni\'m not sure of the price for each dish  but for 10 people  we paid about $18 PER PERSON....', ""Terrible terrible service. We were there for dinner. Food was good when it came but anticipate waiting for a long time. We were there during Chinese New year's celebrations and they should've anticipated that it would be busy.

I'm not sure why the ratings for this place is so low  but I'm a fan. Great place  far better than any dim sum place back in the states. They were missing some of my dim sum favs but everything we had was really great. Only downside was that we had a large party  and when a cart comes by  we'd take a couple of plates  but all the food would be gone in a minute. We would then have to sit a while waiting for the next cart to come over and since we were in the far corner  carts were few and far between."", 'Have been here a few times but will never go back.

We asked to be moved to another table since we saw plenty available ones and they obliged. \n\nWe ordered one of the set menus for $88 which included:\n\n- House soup\n\n- 1 jumbo steamed crab in a light butter sauce with onions.  I don't eat crab that often but it's probably one of the best I've tasted.  Lots of meat  not too much work needed to dig it out.  The meat was very fresh and not overdone.  \n\n- Cold jellyfish and roast pork with crispy skin\n\n- Stirfry scallops and shrimps with veggies and jumbo mushrooms\n\n- Fish and deep fry tofu\n\n- Stirfry tung choi\n\nIn addition  we also ordered snow pea leaves with garlic and half a roast chicken.\n\nFood came fast and super hot.  Portions were gigantic especially the tofu/fish and snow pea leaves dishes.  Although we did have to order bowls of white rice separately as it was not included in the set menu.\n\nDessert was included and it was cold orange slices and a warm sweet taro/tapioca soup.\n\nOverall a fantastic meal and way more than enough food for 6 people.

The potion size is huge! It's best if you share!"", ""Never had a bad experience here. The food is extremely authentic  and if you come for lunch it literally arrives in seconds.

I just avoid looking in the fish tanks."", 'The service was nearly non-existent and extremely rude.

I saw carts of food all around but only later realized thats how they serve you. Also  I had absolutely no idea how pricing worked for this and had to ask a waiter. Even after that I wasn't sure as most of them can't speak English so it was hard to communicate. \n\nThe food itself wasn't bad. It tasted pretty decent but I wasnt impressed with anything  just satisfied. We tried a few things (including chicken feet) which was an interesting experience. The spices on the chicken feet tasted good  but there was almost no meat on it (I guess that is expected but when I looked at the dish it looked more meaty). I wish they had like another chicken dish with the spices they marinated and cooked the feet in. \n\nOverall  the experience was something new to me but the food doesn't leave me wanting more.

Eventually they needed and we were served.\n\nWe were provided one pot of tea  eventually two pots but the tea leaves were not replenished and so tea was quite washed and light.\n\nAt the end of our dinner  we were served red mung bean soup.  It was moderately sweet.  It was okay  but quite filling because it\'s made with glutinous flour or just boiled too long that the tapioca has thickening it.

Awesome!""\n\nIt could be five star  but two reasons stopped me.\n\nFirst  at a previous visit for dim sum  I found that when I had caucasian clients with kids  the servers take advantage of the kids amusement with crab claw dim sums because kids like playing with food.

I can never take health sensitive clients for dim sum and the dinner options really don\'t have clean options.', 'This place has hands down the worst food and service that I have experienced in a while. \nThe decor was super tacky.

When asked for the dumping menu I was given a photo album with just pictures. I then had to ask for another menu that had the description of dumplings. Upon this the server got irritated. \nThe food was super gross. The crab and corn soup had a bad fishy taste. The chicken balls were 90% batter and 10% chicken. They were also fried in an old oil. The only thing that was decent was the scallop dumplings. \nPlease avoid this place at all costs. I will not be returning!', ""I'm told this restaurant has been around for numerous years and the rest of my party were regulars here. Inside it reminded me of a typical Chinese restaurant - golds and reds  fish tank  things weren't new but not too old. There were a number of tables seated and the bigger tables around the edge of the restaurant were filled or had reservations.\n\nThere was a dinner combo set menu available as well as a regular à la carte menu. My table ordered off the à la carte  probably for flexibility in getting exactly what we want.\n\nThe soup came out first - it looked hopeful with greens and meats visible  but the taste was watery and bland. It was also apparent the service was going to feature kind-hearted ladies with fair-to-average serving skills as the soup ladling job was all over the place  literally.\n\nOther dishes came out eventually  featuring sweet and sour pork  thousand island sauce deep fried pork  egg tofu with baby shrimp  garlic shoots and squid with chili sauce  XO sauce string beans  fish fillet with peas...a collection of fairly simple dishes that one could make at home  but would require a hefty grocery run to accomplish all in one dinner. Overall everything tasted good and nothing was poorly done  though the garlic shoots and string beans were much spicier than expected. There were no food-related complaints around the table otherwise. Dessert was sliced oranges and red bean soup - standard  nothing special.\n\nI was impressed by the variety of dishes available at Emerald and satisfied by the pricing - my table of 16 came out to only $16.50 each for what I felt was a large variety of dishes. While nothing stood out nothing was utterly dissatisfying either  which is a great accomplishment given the size of my party. Personally - I felt more interesting and more flavourful dishes can be found in Markham and Richmond Hill  but for being in Mississauga it wasn't bad at all."", ""I've visited this place many times growing up - my parents have often used it as a go-to for celebrating special occasions and family events  and we've also dropped by for weekend dim sum many times. When you get right down to it  this place is basically a Chinese restaurant moonlighting as a banquet hall. Very elaborate and ornate decor (think gold seat covers)  seating to fill a legit army (this place is huge - if you're looking to seat a large group  this is a good place to start)  and good variety to the menu and dim sum carts. \n\nIt isn't the cheapest dim sum spot in the area  but if your main concern is making reservations and ensuring space for a larger group of people  this is a safe bet. The food itself is pretty decent - food from the menu is a decent size  tasty  and comes out quickly. There's good variety to the dim sum choices  lots of dishes to choose from  and the carts come by often. \n\nOverall  a decent choice. Note: they also take reservations."", ""I went here today for dim sum and I love it! The dim sum ordering style may be outside your comfort zone if you're not used to it.\nYou order food as you see them come around on carts  flagging down workers and picking however many dishes you want from the cart. They will mark down the types of dishes you got  which will add to your total. Different carts have different items  but the same carts will come around quite often.\nIt's a great way to eat with your eyes  picking food that looks good and they taste good too!

They serve dim sum until 4pm on the weekends. Then it becomes a regular Chinese restaurant - I have totally made that mistake before  although their chicken wasn't bad.\n\nThis places charges for tea  so make sure you want tea before you ordered it. It can get pricey and that's how a lot of dim sum places get you!\n\nI see some of the other reviewers saying how you had to be firm and you do. All the cart ladies want to pawn their food on you... Especially if you aren't Asian... Also  if you want to order anything off the menu or even get extra napkins  you will have to flag down one of the servers in the black vests. They take their division of labour very seriously.\n\nYou should order a side of the stir fry snow peas. They don't normally bring that out. It's solid!\n\nMy personal favourites are the scallop dumplings (they are known for their scallop dishes)  seafood dumplings  chicken feet  crab claw and fried tofu wrap...\n\nI'm probably going this weekend.

I really liked the crab claw. It was pretty tasty  although not the best I've ever had. The same can be said about every other dish we had. Good  but not exceptional. \n\nWhy won't I come back again? Because the bill came out to $80 with tip...and they charged me wrong originally so I had to go to the counter and talk to them before I got almost $30 refunded. The service was mediocre. A couple of time  the carts almost went by and we had to flag it down to grab something off of it. It wasn't the worst service  but it certainly wasn't memorable either  and at the prices they are charging compared to other parts of Toronto  I was expecting more."", ""Took my parents here recently to celebrate a birthday and left disappointed. This place used to have great dimsum but now I no longer think it's worth the drive. The chicken feet was really good though  so many if I have an exclusive craving for that I'll come back.

Its not exactly the best I ever had but comparing it to the food I had years ago at this place says a lot.\n\nPrices are still up there in my opinion but then again a lot of produce are getting ridiculously expensive now a days.\n\nDecor needs an update... if anyone cares. And also  theres a ton of seating in this place and the staff was attentive (its hard to use the term friendly because they weren't lol) when we came in and our service was prompt.\n\nParking at the front of the restaurant can be busy but theres more parking around the back if the front is full. \n\nOverall  not the best one in Mississauga but its not bad place to go either."", 'Vile.  This was one of the worst examples of food quality out there. The fried rice was just plain greasy but not fried and crispy like it should be.  The lemon chicken was HARD and a funny color - so disgusting.  It was dismal and inedible. I would absolutely recommend you MISS this place.', ""Wasn't that great. Taste of the food was blend. Not authentic chinese food. Ambiance very loud. Servers were screaming among themselves and they forget they have customers who are close to them.

I was very unimpressed. We started with gyoza and edamame. Neither were anything special. We then ordered a chicken teriyaki plate and a few sushi rolls. The chicken teriyaki was nothing more than some boiled chicken smothered in teriyaki sauce. Was not good at all. The sushi was mediocre at best. While they were friendly and the service was pretty good - I will not be back.', 'Went there Saturday noon they open at 12pm but people were waiting outside before 12pm so you can tell it should be a good place. Nice Katsu & Eel with rice. Many Japanese go there.', 'Went to this restaurant on Saturday as I had a craving for a Japanese ramen. It was packed for Saturday dinner. We were seated at the bar and ordered soft shell crab roll  donkotsu ramen and katsu jyu(pork cutlet with egg). \n\nAfter soft shell crab roll was served first  we waited for 30minutes for other dishes. They said it was a little busy but they should have managed the kitchen in a better way on the weekend. The serving lady was kind enough to bring complimentary edamame while we were waiting.\n\nThe ramen was served and soup was very rich but salty.(or was my day bad as the cook put more salt by accident?!)I liked the noodle though. Katsu jyu was katsu-don in a bento box style. Katsu was okay  not that crispy enough. I maybe expected too much(authentic japanese ramen and donkotsu) as I heard the owner was Japanese. They can do better. \nIt leaves a lot to be desired. 3stars for the food and 2stars for the service.', ""This place will always have a place in my stoma....errr...heart.  I have been coming here since high school  and I had graduated in '05 (woot!).  No need to worry about parking as this cozy restaurant is nestled in a shopping center.\n\nI like Musashi as it's small and intimate in there.  They have booths  tables  a small bar  but what I really like is to sit in their room.  It looks like you'd have to sit criss cross apple sauce style the whole time cause it looks like your sitting on the floor  but there is openings for you to hang your feet.  Make sure to take off your shoes before going into the room!\n\nI prefer to go during lunch as I feel like I can get the most bang for my buck.  When you go in during lunch  make sure to look towards your right and you'll see A  B  C lunch options.  Those options aren't on the menu and change daily.  \n\nMy favorite thing to get here is the Ton-Kat-Su.  Man on man!  If I had to chose a meal I had to eat everyday for the rest of my life  this would be it.  It never disappoints!  And the salad that comes with it tastes so delicious due to their salad dressing!  If you think you can't get more salad dressing...YOU CAN!  I usually ask the younger guy server and he brings me a bottle to put more dressing on to my heart's delight!\n\nThe staff here is really nice and you'll always see the same familiar faces when coming in.  Come check them out!  I promise you'll enjoy their food!"", 'Well first time I\'ve really had ""authentic"" Japanese; ""non-Americanized"" (no chicken covered in sugar sauce here). The Chicken Katsu is what I laid my eyes upon and I was pleasantly surprised when it came out. A good portion of chicken with many veggie and fruit options; highly recommend.\n\nThe place is small. The service is courteous but slow. Those are negative remarks that only hold it back slightly. If you enjoy changing it up on your taste buds  check it out.', ""I just came back from living in Japan for two years  and Musashi is one of the most authentic Japanese restaurants I've been to. Not only that  but the prices aren't too bad either. I had some kind of vegetarian nabe (like a one pot dish) and beef tongue  my friend had the tonkatsu (fried pork cutlets-- they gave more than one  which was a surprise)  and we both had a few Asahi beers and a cheap bottle of sake without completely breaking the bank (maybe about $30 a person with tip and everything).\n\nThe atmosphere is nothing special. It's a small restaurant in a strip mall  but they do have a couple tables on tatami where you can sit on the floor Japanese style (if that's your thing). Personally  I'd rather have good food than a beautiful restaurant  so I didn't mind at all.\n\nAll-in-all  I think I'll definitely go back next time I have a craving for ramen or some other Japanese food that's a bit tough to find in Charlotte.\n\nThe key thing was that the rest of the guests were Japanese  which is always a good sign!"", 'First of all it must be said that this is a JAPANESE-style sushi house. If you are new to sushi or the Japanese culture  this will not be the restaurant for you. \n\nJapanese style means that when you need a drink refill or want to order something extra  you must wave down the waiters as is the culture in Japan. Americans and we southerner\'s especially  are not used to this type of service. This is why most of the people that eat in this restaurant are Japanese. If you eat lunch between 1-2PM you will have better service.\n\nThe food is also VERY Japanese. The emphasis is on the fresh fish and the rice. If you are not accustomed to Japanese food  then you may want a non-Japanese sushi bar like Sushi-101 (Mexican made) or Rusan\'s (Indonesian made) or several others in Charlotte which are Chinese. You will find many varieties of fried sushi with sugary mayo in these locations if that\'s your idea of sushi.\n\nI have eaten here every week for years. It is a small restaurant with basic rolls. They are very consistent and the food is always excellent. I have never gotten ""brown wasabe"" or fish that I didn\'t know what it was. The Bento boxes at lunch are excellent with 2 pieces of big roll  a maki roll  soup  salad and usually a bit of seafood salad for about $8.\n\nI have eaten at many Japanese style restaurants and must admit it has taken me a while to understand their culture. Now that I have explained it to you  maybe you will be able to enjoy Musashi\'s great food. If great service is most important to you  find a culture that is known for that like the Thai people at Thai House.', 'Located in a small plaza is an authentic Japanese restaurant. Very small establishment but has a seating area where you can sit down and feel like your in a Japanese house. Service was excellent  got seated immediately and food came out really quickly faster than Sonics. Limited on choices for lunch but all was excellent. Soft rice to crispy katsu equals great quality. Will be coming back again to try others on the menu! Recommend the Katsu-Don and Katsu Curry.', ""Waiting for my tekkadon I ate my miso soup but what happened to the umami flavor it had before. It was rather salty instead.  Wondering if the kitchen chef changed or if this is just a temporary setback? In any case  I'm not giving Musashi up yet since it's close to home cooking. \n\n03-03-17 (A Friday Dinner)\nDisappointed. It was packed tonight. Had to wait about 15 mins for a table. Then  had to wait 45-50 for our food. But  the waiting wasn't the problem because anticipating a delicious dinner would make it all worthwhile. WRONG. \n\nThe first time I ate the tekkadon sashimi was cut right:  cut thick n all the same size. I was in heaven right here in NORTH CAROLINA. No MSG. No thirst after the meal. And  the tuna was so tasty that it was definitely tuna FOR sashimi  not the cheap tuna u find in the supermarket or Costco. \n\nTonight the tekkadon sashimi was cut in all kinds of shapes which I believe were leftover cuts that should hv gone in a chirashi bowl  NOT served as sashimi in tekkadon. I suppose it all goes into your mouth n only the flavor matters? Hmm  I guess I'm ole fashion n lived in Japan too long. \n\nI also ordered three uni sashimi. Hey! What's with the same price of $3.50 for an uni sushi when an uni sushi previously ordered on another visit had TWO pieces of uni on the sushi. This time it was only ONE piece for the sashimi!!! But  I must say the tuna was definitely tasty n sashimi quality.\n\nWe were so thirsty after eating there tho which is a sign of MSG  lots n lots. \n\nThe tempura shrimp was perfect  not doughy or undercooked. \n\nStill  since it's near  I'm not giving up on Musashi but will try other dishes next time."", ""Tonkatsu Ramen!!!\nITADAKIMAS!!\n\nThis place is authentic. \nYou'll find several decent types of sake and small plates here  from Shisamo to hamachi kama.\nif you have not had either  you should try it. Their agedashi tofu is also awesome.\n\nThey have both tonkatsu ramen and also miso ramen. Buddy of mine has the latter and i think it is better than the tonkatsu ramen. The tonkatsu is good  but the broth of the miso ramen looked so rich and flavorful.\n\nI had a few pieces of sashimi but the plan is to go back for more."", 'We decided to try Musashi on Friday night after reading some other Yelp reviews and I\'m happy to say it was a great experience!  Everyone in there seemed like regulars (several were commenting that it was busier than usual on a Friday night)  and some seemed to have ""their table.""  Just like another reviewer said  I always take it as a good sign when I visit an ethnic restaurant and see it full of people from that ethnicity.  We were definitely in the minority at Musashi and so I knew the food would be very authentic (and awesome).\n\nThe service was a little slow and disorganized  so that\'s the only reason I can\'t give Musashi 5 stars.  I ordered the vegetable tempura dinner that came with rice and miso soup and it was fantastic.  We also had the vegetable spring roll appetizer.  My food arrived to the table about 15 minutes prior to my husband\'s sushi.  Would\'ve been nice to eat together but it wasn\'t a deal breaker.  Like I said  a little disorganized but otherwise very good.  \n\nWe will definitely go back to Musashi - great food  authentic experience and well priced.', ""I'm a huge fan of Japanese and Ramen and growing up in Hawaii  it's hard to find what I like. This place is like someone's grandma made food for you it's the best. It's not super fancy greatness of the food is mostly in how it's done and what's in it. It is  well prepared yummy and delicious.  Its not going to break my bank because it's fancy.  It's simple I have hit every ramen place in town and this is the place I go to 90%of the time."", ""Awesome! We had the fried baby crabs... they were so good that we placed a second order. I could have eaten just those for dinner!\n\nHubby had the Sushi Deluxe plate  and enjoyed the chef's selections. I ordered the Chirashi  and it was great.\n\nI have to mention their salmon. It was fresh  buttery  and utterly delightful. (I'm craving it now that I'm typing this!)\n\nTheir service was prompt and friendly. The restaurant is small but efficient.\n\nWe have found our new favorite sushi in Charlotte  and will be at Muashi Japanese Restaurant often."", ""I've been visiting this restaurant only because this is the *only* place I can get Japanese home style dishes  such as Katsuju  Tenju or grilled fish with rice and misoshiru. \n\nDecent Japanese restaurants would put some grated daikon with grilled fish. Especially for these prices. Everything is so skimpy and jobs are sloppy. \n\nService? You don't have to take your dishes from/to kitchen. That's all about it.\n\nThis place used to be filled with Japanese business persons after work and Japanese families. Not many Japanese customers now. No wonder.\n\nI keep praying for a decent authentic Japanese restaurant coming to Charlotte. For now  I just drive to the Triangle. It's worth 2.5 hour driving."", 'Japanese owned Japanese restaurant. \nI had a Chirashi couple of days ago  it was very good!\nThey have verity of Japanese food not only teriyaki  sushi or rolls.\n5 stars.', ""I'm a fan of their food - service is a different story. I have been here on several occasions  and there's always a stone cold looking older Japanese lady who never cracks a smile. Honestly I'm more scared of her than anything else. The other ladies are nicer  but please keep in mind language is a definite barrier (ex. asking for anything more than the basics will likely not get you any answer). Having a large party in that tatami room is nice  but it is not the best idea during Friday & Saturday nights peak time... let's just say it can be very chaotic.\n\nWith that being said  I love their food. It's my friend's favorite place for ramen and Japanese homecooking. They have some sushi but not a big selection. Personally I prefer nigiri and sashimi.\n\nThey have a Japanese menu - I found out from my parents' Chinese friends. Again communicating with the waitstaff is difficult but it's worth the work to order something different."", 'This is my second time here and both times the waitresses have been rude. Especially the older cock-eyed lady. We\'ve waited for over an hour the first time I went and 40 minutes the second time. When I came in today I saw the tatami styled table was available so I asked one of the waitresses if we could sit at the bigger table/tatami styled table because we had a party of 7. Her response was ""uh no. "" I didn\'t understand why so I decided to ask another waitress if the table was reserved and she mumbled an answer and walked away. The first time I went  after waiting an hour  one of the waitresses called us up to come and be sat but then she forced us to go and wait longer because another group that was already sat wanted to move to the table we were supposed to be sat at. It ended up being extremely chaotic because the entrance was already packed and the minute we moved to come sit at the table then the line moved up and we were forced to stand in the middle of the restaurant because we couldn\'t be seated. It seems as though they tend to favor other Japanese people more and try to get them seated as quickly as possible. They need a bigger entrance  a hostess  and better management. They didn\'t give us enough menus or silverware and didn\'t ask what we wanted to drink. The floor is extremely sticky  not sure why I guess they don\'t clean the floors. As for the food  I really did enjoy the food but I may not be back again because of the horrible service and rude waitresses. If you still decide to go  try the tenpura lunch or katsu-jyu. I tried to give them a second chance but I\'ve never felt this disrespected before. Maybe I will try again far far far far far far far far into the future. Not happy at all. Not only that but every one at the table except one person got their food and he had to wait an extra 25 minutes for his. I also had to go grab a napkin and a pair of chopsticks myself because they didn\'t provide me with one. How disappointing.', ""Very authentic Japanese restaurant in the area (I'm a native Japanese).\nFriendly service and nice atmosphere.\nBento box is a very good value.\nWould be nice if they had more appetizer options."", ""This place is a hidden gem. I've heard of this place but never really took the time to stop. This place is pretty authentic. The decor is even authentic. The place is small and the tables are close together. I decided to get ramen with the miso broth. It was savory and delicious. It was filling and just plain good! My husband got the sushi platter and he was pretty pleased with it. He said it was very fresh. Overall  this place is good! Please note they do not do any substitutions!"", ""Food is honestly really good. The place to go for ramen in the Queen City. Huge Downside is the Service.  Eating out is an experience and they clearly haven't figured this out."", 'I love sushi and japanese food.  I was looking for a gem.  My wife and I tried Musashi and she got food poisoning from the teriyaki chicken.  My sushi was decent  but it did not make up for the chicken.  Obviously.  Granted this dinner was a few months ago  so hopefully they have improved.', 'This was my first trip to Musashi.  I ordered the pork ramen  and my girlfriend ordered the tempura shrimp and vegetable udon.  We also ordered an eggplant in light sauce appetizer. Everything was extremely good.  The ramen seemed extremely authentic.  It even had one of those little fish cakes in it. The udon was the best I have had in town.  \n\nI will definitely go back and try their sushi  and order more soup  even though it is about a 25 minute drive for me to get there.', ""I acquired a taste for Japanese food during my frequent business trips to South East Asia and Japan. In India  it is impossible to find good Japanese food without paying eye-popping prices. When I moved to the US in 2009  I'd expected to be much better off. Columbia  SC where I worked was not exactly the big city I'd hoped to live in and dining options were very limited. So Charlotte is where I ventured for some variety.\n\nMusashi is the only authentic Japanese place in Charlotte. I used to stop by here every time I drive through Charlotte or would come to the Charlotte airport to pick up my girlfriend. I moved to Charlotte in 2010 and thought that I'd be a regular visitor after that. The 10-11 mile drive from uptown where I stay meant that I actually visited them even less frequently than when I lived in Columbia.\n\nI'd say that the Sushi has gotten better here from what I remember from my 1st visit in 2009. But the real treats here are the Ramen (love the Tonkatsu Ramen) and the Japanese menu (my faves are the Fish Liver and the Beef & Tofu). Ingredients are top-notch. For example  just try the fried squid - perfectly cooked and the best quality that I've had anywhere including Singapore. \n\nMy girlfriend had been very relucatant to try Japanese food because she was always worried about using chopsticks. One visit to Ippudo NYC convinced her that she needed to eat more Japanese food. We went to Musashi twice this weekend when she flew down to visit me :-) Sat lunch and Sun dinner! So now she is a convert too!\n\nIt is not cheap. But I'd say that it is great value for money - you do get more than what you pay for! Excellent service  nice traditional kind of ambience that is way more than the outside strip mall exterior might suggest. And most of all  fantastic food that I will miss when I move from Charlotte in April :-("", 'Authentic Japanese food in a friendly atmosphere!\n\nWe had the savory tonkatsu ramen  crispy and moist katsu chicken  and perfectly sliced and fried vegetable tempura for dinner.  Starters were gyoza (get two orders  these went so fast!)  potato croquettes  and age dashi tofu.  Real green tea was a very pleasant surprise too.\n\nI suppose the true testament to the quality of the food was the customer base- over 50% Japanese tourists/visitors in the time we were there.', 'This restaurant seems actually run by Japanese people  which is rare for a Japanese restaurant in the US. It also seems to receive a good number of Japanese regulars  which is always a good sign. I see they\'re trying to be authentic in their food (I lived in Japan  and I can tell). \n\nAnyway  the ramen I tried  I guess you just can\'t make it as good as you\'d get in Japan. It is pretty ordinary ramen (stuff you could make with the material you gather from an asian market without much efforts)  but pricey  (not as meh and pricy as the ones I tried in St. Mark\'s Place in NYC though  those were absolute rip-offs and were literally cup-noodles in bowls!). \n\nThe lunch sushi plate I didn\'t try but I saw a sample display at the entrance --- the usual cheapie American style sushi  i.e. a bunch of makis (easy to make a bunch  easier to cheat the flavor of lower quality sashimi  not accidentally never ever seen served in restaurants in japan)  fake crab meats (seriously  why would any supposedly ""authentic"" japanese restaurant serve this crap? Why not skip the crab anything altogether if the real thing is so expensive?)  etc.\n\nOK food. Really  not much better (but certainly not worse) than any other japanese or sushi restaurants in Charlotte  and the prices were OK. The Japanese regulars seems to frequent the place because they know it cannot get any better in Charlotte as far as Japanese cuisine goes (not because the food there is as good as they\'d get back home). So what can you do?', ""Best authentic Japanese restaurant in Charlotte! The sushi is always fresh and delicious. From simple rolls  like the California roll  to their more complex and modern rolls  like the Yankee Roll  is delicious. Everything else on the meal is great. I've had their ramen  katsu  almost everything and it's delicious. \n\nIt is a small restaurant so I would call and make a reservation.\n\nThey also have specials and certain items that aren't on their menu. Just ask if you want to try something new and exciting."", 'They have very fresh sushi for a good price!  Very yummy ramen too!  My hubby and I went there for the second weekend now!  We like to sit at the bar and watch the sushi chef work.. and they are also quick with excellent service.', 'Very disappointed after reading the generous reviews about the authenticity. We really wanted to like this place as a sushi/Asian alternative to some of our favorites including Sushi Guru  Tsuki  Futo Buta Asian18 etc.and much prefer the freshness and service they offer.\n\nThe staples to Japanese food are rice .which was good and seafood which was of mediocre quality. Most portions were small and pricey and not impressive. The limited lunch menu left a lot to be desired with many popular items only on the dinner menu such as teriyaki salmon  sushi  ramen etc. we had to ask for sushi menus which seemed to be a rare exception? \n\nWe may try dinner or carry out hesitantly and try to naviagate the good parts of their menu if they let us. Good luck to Masushi and their customers.', 'A must try!!!!This is an adorable place with very friendly staff. The food was excellent. I had the teriyaki plate. Everything on the plate was to die for. My husband got the bento box (a little bit of everything). He came away stuffed. Even with me stealing samples . Picky eater daughter got he Ramen bowl and loved it.', ""All I have had is the ramen. That's all I need to know. I had shoyu ramen and it was amazing. Flavorful broth and great chew to the noodles. Love the bok choy and pork too."", 'They are one of the few (if not the only) Japanese family-style restaurant in the South Charlotte & Uptown area.  With only 10+ tables served by three wait staff during peak hours  be prepared for a small wait for a table at weekends. \n\nThey have lunch sets that change on a daily basis which offer a good choice of salads  sushi and small bites. We also enjoy coming here in the evenings and ordering from the Izakaya style Japanese menu that includes a good selection of grilled fish (saury  mackerel and ""hokke""). Their sushi is also ok  but it won\'t knock you off your chair in terms of freshness and taste.', 'Family went to Mizuho and found that it was closed (7/11/10)! This was a huge letdown - seems another sushi restaurant with a different name is taking its place - will just have to wait and see how it turns out.\n\nAnyway we went to Musashi as a second choice and it was not nearly as nice as Mizuho. Atmosphere is cluttered and tables are too close together for any privacy. I ordered Sushi Deluxe  which was OK and came with miso soup but no salad as most places serve  and a Kirin beer. Wife ordered individual nigiri with spicy tuna roll - also OK. And daughter ordered teriyaki chicken - poor at best (chicken breast apparently baked with sauce poured on top  very plain salad  small amount of noodles and bowl of rice). The girls chose water to drink. Despite below average restaurant and food  service was very good.\n\n$75! Sushi is expensive and that is OK  but this was too much for below average atmosphere and food. Add a tip and the meal was nearly $90 - last trip to Musashi!\n\nSo the search is on for good sushi in South Charlotte!', ""*I have given up on Japanese food in Charlotte*\n\nAny restaurant that fails to acknowledge the customer for over 5 minutes is never going to be good in my book. Musashi makes it easy by serving average food to go with their incredibly crappy service.\n\nWe came in the door and waited by the register for over 5 minutes before anyone even greeted us. The place is pretty small so its not like they couldn't see us. The sushi chefs kept looking at us but never moved a muscle to signal the waitresses that we were waiting.\nAfter we sat down  we ordered beer which arrived soon but after that the service was back to crap. \n\nWe ordered tamago sushi which never arrived and we had to ask another waitress to get it because our original waitress simply stopped attending tables. The tamago was quite good. \n\nI got the Udon which was basically chicken broth and noodles with a little green onions sprinkled on it. A monkey can be more creative than that and I certainly did not enjoy paying $9 for it. It had no taste  no spices  not even any soy sauce in it. It was literally broth and noodles. I showered it with their chilli flakes so I could trick myself into thinking it was eatable.\n\nOh and the service wasn't bad for all customers - these two Japanese guys came in and the wait staff fell over each other trying to please them. Every other table was being ignored but these two basically got personal slaves to take care of them. They never had to ask for anything  the waitress was hovering over their table every 3 minutes. \n\nThe service pissed me off and I would never go back even though their sushi is pretty good."", 'This is a no frill authentic Japanese restaurant that is generally filled with Japanese and other Asians. If you are looking to order fancy drinks and Americanized California rolls  this is not the place for you. Go to Nikko in South End for the Upscale experience and super expensive Sushi.\n\nI believe this is now the only place in Charlotte where you can order really good Bento Boxes and authentic Ramen Noodle bowls. Mai Japanese Restaurant used to have good Bento boxes when they were at South Blvd. location but they have abandoned Bento Box since they have moved to Colony Road location.  \n\nSushi here are very fresh and there are plenty of Japanese appetizers on the menu in English and Japanese.

I\'ve tried just about everything on the menu and Musashi never disappoints. If you ""authentic"" Japanese ramen and not the ramen fusion that\'s around town  you have to come here  it\'s top notch. Their sushi is spot on and you can\'t go wrong with their bento box offerings. We come here  at least  once a week.. so good!', 'My wife and i dine in here for dinner. First off they do not keep in track of first in first serve. We kind of had to guess who is next.... Also order 1 bottle of sake and  2 chirashi dinner which costed 21.99 each. And they gave us soo little sashimi and portions did match the price... And the lady didnt even give us water for frist 15mins and before we even finished eat she handed us a check... Not even buffet places hand yoh5check before u ask..... And we didnt even stay more than 40mins total. And didnt want to stay any longer..... I would give this place 0 star if i could....', 'Best place for authentic Asian/Japanese food. Must try the ramen bowl and bento box. Great sushi too!', 'I used to visit Japan often to meet customers. I\'ve eaten at Rameen places where a bowl costs $4 and is a full meal to the fancy sushi places that are Gaijin traps where prices can run to over $100 per head easily for a good meal.\n\nMusashi is an unpretentious  genuine Japanese place that bring back the best of authentic Japanese food to me. Except for the Sushi. The only Sushi I\'ve liked here is the Ikura. Of course  they have some rolls on the menu for the Gaijin ;-) which made me sceptical when I first visited. But a quick ""Sumimasen"" did the trick and I got good advice on what is best on the menu. Got chided on my 2nd visit for drinking Sake for lunch but explained that my friend had never had tried it. They were most welcoming of me when I came on my own and I was most embarrassed (and ignored by them) when I visited this place with my girlfriend - because she is exactly the sort of Gaijin who\'d insist on ordering Sushi rolls and ignore their wonderful Tonkatsu rameen.\n\nSo to cut it short  this is a place only if you like genuine Japanese  hole-in-the-wall kind of places. If you are looking strictly for Sushi  I\'d still recommend the Tamago and the Ikura over any other place within 100 miles.', 'I love this restaurant.  The best Japanese menu in the city.  It is not trendy or fusion   just good traditional Japanese family restaurant food.', ""Lunch Review:\n\nWe pulled up at 11:45 am to discover that they didn't open till 12 for lunch. We waited patiently in the car. At 12 pm  the sign flipped to open and a people started emerging from their car to walk in. The restaurant itself is pretty tiny. There were a few booths  two small 2-top tables  a few larger tables pushed together and a separate  traditional dining area for larger parties.\n\nThey had their lunch special A and lunch special B out to view on a table near the register. I ordered the lunch special A - rice with beef on top and a smaller bowl of pork ramen. The beau ordered the miso ramen. Overall  I enjoyed my food and he enjoyed his. It really wasn't anything to rave about though. Pretty standard. Definitely not the best ramen I've had  but hey... It was Charlotte good. \n\nA few things I found annoying... The floors were slightly sticky feeling and the service was curt at best. I won't be going out of my way to return unless i have a huge hankering for ramen."", ""I went at about 6:30p on a Monday.

That aside  the sashimi is serviceable and generally as fresh as Charlotte gets.  The specials will almost always be a fantastic deal. You will always have two options to choose from--and while people may hold subconscious grudges against the letter B  I can assure you that electing special B will not detract from your dining experience whatsoever.  My parents and sister love the mackerel here  if that's your thing; I have too many bad memories of those fermented fishies in rancid tomato paste to really care for it outside of raw sashimi slivers.  For those attempting to beat back the oppressive curtain that is the Charlotte summer  Musashi is one of the few places here that serves up a refreshing plate of chewy zaru soba. \n\nI also remember the wines being spelled super weirdly.  Like Kabernet Sabigny-kind of weird.  That was sort of endearing.\n\nOf course  it's plagued by the same service problems and dour server expressions that other Asian restaurants have  which still can be a bit of a shock in the land of sunshine and Southern hospitality."", ""Musashi is by far- the best Japanese Restaurant! \n\nMy choices are from the appetizer are: \n\nShrimp Shumai (Steamed shrimp dumplings) and Shrimp Tempura (Lightly battered fried shrimp & vegetable) - yes  I order these two items for my appetizer every time we come.  I don't care  it was an amazing flavor  real Japanese style Shumai and Tempura! it is a perfection. \n\nThen  I would then order my favorite soup : \n\nTonkotsu (Pork bone base)  Japanese egg noodle w/ roasted pork slices  bamboo shoot & green onions.

This is TRUE Japanese food  Ramen  Curry  Sushi etc.. is authentic and not made like you\'d get at a asian fusion place. I\'d say if you come with an open mind about the sushi you\'d like it otherwise stick with the Ramen and Gyoza can\'t go wrong there! \n\nService can be a bit scattered but everyone is very friendly  this is a family owned restaurant so it\'s not always ""ran efficiently"". But in the end you come to a restaurant for the food not the great service ala Peter Lugers. With that said everyone that has worked in their is quite friendly.', ""The food is better than average and affordably priced but service is extremely slow and there's no rhyme or reason as to when dishes come out of the kitchen.  They don't answer their phone any time of day and don't return calls so it's nearly impossible to make a reservation unless you happen to be willing to stop by before your dinner engagement.  \n\nBut it's a nice small restaurant for impromptu sushi dinners for couples or a party of 3 or 4.  That's probably their focal point anyway.  They do have tatami mat seating and a fairly broad  if expensive  sake selection.  \n\nI would immediately give them four or even five stars if service was a little more organized and purposeful and if the staff could be significantly friendlier.  There are only two servers even on Saturday nights during prime time  so perhaps that is the source of the problem anyway.  Be prepared for long waits during your meal if you go with a group of 5 or more."", ""Musashi is my favorite spot in Charlotte for authentic ramen or a bento box lunch. The sushi is also good - the fish is always fresh and the portions are generous. The servers never have much to say  but I can't complain since service is fast and I'm there for the food. :)"", ""The BEST service I've had in a long time! All of our food was made to order. I just loved that! The inside is small the staff is friendly and the prices are great!"", ""My family has been a repeat customer (and huge fans) of this place for as long as I can remember.  I really don't think you can go wrong with anything on this menu; the food is authentic  as so many people have said below  and doesn't disappoint.  The setup of the restaurant is nice  and the servers are extremely nice and friendly.  I love a good bento box or bowl of ramen from here.  And out of all the sushi I've ever had  theirs is definitely at  or at least very near  the top of my list.  You can always count on this place for a satisfying lunch or dinner."", ""Terrible.  Very disappointing. We went for ramen and it was very plain and tasteless.  Hard boiled egg instead of pickled.  Dry pork instead of pork belly. Asked if they could make just a plate of noodles for our 3 year old and she said no.  We don't have noodles.  Well what is in your ramen?  Services was just plain rude."", ""Very authentic japanese restaurant.  We ordered curry rice  sushi dinner  a ramen  and katsu don.  And some appetizers.\n\nSushi rolls the right way  katsu tastes like authentic and agedashi was good too.\n\nGyoza was excellent  something I haven't had the best for long time.  You can tell they are home made.\n\nCurry  I m suspecting that they use the curry blocks you buy from market  but nonetheless it tastes good.  But it's pricey for its serving.\n\nRamen is still not the best I had.  They use lean pork.  The broth is just ok.  The whole thing is average but not overly disappointed.  I m a big fan of ramen  and I rate this over yama in midwood and futo buta.  Need to try the yume bistro next."", 'Awesome sushi great environment only two servers and yet they still managed to help us and get us everything on time amazing place definitely coming back', ""Came back for Ramen and so very glad I did!! This place had some absolutely delicious ramen that was flavored and cooked to perfection. I am not a ramen expert but it's the best I've had in Charlotte. \n\nAgain their other food is good and authentic and while I originally said I wasn't blown away I feel like it might be a slight injustice. The food at Musashi's is made to be good. It's kind of like when your mom or grandmother cooks. You know you love it and it tastes amazing to you but it's not something you see in a fancier establishment so you don't feel impressed. However it is exactly that good and tastes great and that's what you get from Musashi's!"", ""So happy to find this place in Charlotte.  I never thought I would find authentic Japanese food made by Japanese in North Carolina.  And it's really good too!  I had some of the best Tonkatsu ever and my mom is Japanese.  My husband had the Chicken Katsu which was breast and is always a plus.  He said it was so tender and crispy.  I also had the Ika Karaage which was fried crispy yet was not tough at all.  I can't wait to go back and try something else!  \n\nService was fast for a small place.  They all work together as a team and it shows."", ""A group of friends and I had a great time at Musashi.  We were in the elevated room with floor seating.  I have not had traditional ramen soup before - it was great!  I think we were probably a little much for the typical crowd there so maybe don't show up with a ton of bros in tow."", ""Authentic Japanese food in an otherwise nondescript location. Fresh and generously sliced sashimi  lightly breaded tempura done right [not a heavy batter used to disguise miniscule portions of vegetables and cocktail shrimp]  flavorful ramen and noodles  and housemade sauces for nearly all their dishes  including the light miso-based salad dressing! We ordered the fried baby crabs and tofu for appetizers [tofu was divine...not overly cooked]  then a sashimi platter  a ramen  an udon  a tonkatsu entree and the spicy pork belly w/kimchee dish [an unusual item for a Japanese restaurant as I believe it's a Korean dish  but wonderfully prepared nevertheless]. None of the dishes were too sauce-heavy or overly fried and the soups/broths were not too salty. As a result  you could actually taste the food...what a concept!"", ""I'm a Japanophile myself and I LOVE Musashi. As far as I know  it is the only place to find real authentic Japanese food in the Charlotte area. It has a tatami room where you can sit to eat and feel even more traditional (usually for big parties). To most  the staff doesn't seem so friendly which I think is a standard Japanese way of just staying out of your way. For me it seems they really like it when I come in and converse in Japanese with them. The cook was even nice enough to make me a special order of curry soba - which was great! I try to come back here every two weeks just to be in that authentic Japanese environment. The only setback is that I live so far from it."", 'We have been here a couple of times with overall good experience. I would recommend people try everything... my Japanese coworker told Musashi might be the best Japanese in town..lol', 'Just like you\'re in Japan.  Food is fantastic and 100% authentic.  Prices are great for lunch  normal for dinner.  Be sure to check the ""A"" and ""B"" lunch choices when you walk in.  They\'re always displayed up front  with plastic wrap on them.\n\nSome things to expect that are a little unique:\n-Closed on Tuesday\n-Doesn\'t open until 12pm  closed between lunch and dinner\n-Orders come out when ready for each person  not all at once\n-Small restaurant  normally pretty crowded', 'Great traditional Japanese spot. If you want to taste more than sushi and discover the greatness of Japanese cuisine  his is the right place. \nLunch specials filling and affordable  friendly servers.

They are so sweet and awesome. Great Japanese food :)', ""Nice decor  cute place  very great service. The miso and pork bone ramen were really good but just a little bit more expensive than what I'm used to!"", 'This is as close as it gets in this town. Good variety of standards and super friendly environment.', 'This place has delicious  authentic  Japanese ramen! The gyoza are delicious. I always get the pork ramen (tonkatsu)... A bowl of happiness :) I have yet to try their sushi or teriyaki   but it looks so good. It is always full of happy customers! I love Musashi!', ""I hate to give a bad review on a rare restaurant that's actually run by Japanese people (apparently)  but it just wasn't a good food. The sushi set I ordered was a typical Americanized sushi affair. Not authentic at all.\n\nI also don't know where they find their cooks  but I seriously doubt the Japanese guy behind the sushi counter was properly trained in the sushi making (at least not in Japan). Just because the guy is a Japanese  doesn't make him any kind of sushi master. It's a profession  not a nationality. He also was very slow in making his sushis. I had to wait at the counter for my sushi set for nearly 30 mins while the guy was chatting a bunch of lame stuff with other customers at the counter. Not only he doesn't seem like a proper sushi cook  his work-attitude was not professional at all. They need to hire somebody else before he pisses off too many customers."", ""We were there around 6PM  the place was empty.  I had second doubt about this place since it was situated in a questionable location. We were greeted by an older lady (assuming she was the owner)  not the warmest greeting we had ever received. Few minutes had passed  the server came to take our drink order. We ordered large hot sake & a bottle of Sapporo. The Sapporo came out quickly but the sake came about 10 minutes after. Seemed like he had to heat the sake in a microwave. Fine  I thought got to myself since we were the 1st customer  maybe the sake machine wasn't turn on. We ordered edamame & fried squid legs. They were both just ok  nothing really stood out. For the main course  we ordered Tom Katsu Ramen & a sushi roll. For the ramen  this is legit!  The broth is light & rich (not thick like other place). Only complaint was an overcooked egg. The roll?  Wife ate all of it since it had eel & I didn't really care for.  She wanted to order more so we ordered maguro  ika  hamachi  spider roll  futo maki. Nothing was short of excellence!  Don't mind the way the sushi chef cut the fish  the quality was out of this world. This had to be the best quality we ever had (if you look at my review  we had also tried Nobu's Aspen. You know we are foodies!). We kept ordering like 4 round of sushi total  all of which were the best. Overall  if you rate this place less than 5 stars  you are crazy!"", ""I really enjoy Japanese food and had heard how authentic Musashi was. Well  that is true. It is authentic and just as bland as some of the Japanese restaurants in Japan. The ingredients were fresh and my Nabeyaki Udon tasted good and was hot and savory. It just had no spice at all to it. Once I shook in a lot of the spice they brought with it  it became a decent meal. If this was available at pho prices  I would be back. However  with that dish costing $15+  I'd rather pick up some fresh bok choy and some Myojo Udon noodle packets and DIY udon at home."", ""After hearing my dad rave about this place we decided to do his birthday dinner here. He doesn't rave about anything  which means it has to be good. He used to work for a Japanese company and they would frequent this place after work. \n\nI'm a Japanese food novice  so I let my dad order everything. Their menu is simple and so is their layout. Just two ladies were serving a packed restaurant and they really kept up quite well. But you don't care about that. THE FOOD WAS AMAZING. I'm excited to add Musashi to my regular rotation."", ""Firstly this is one of rare few actual Japanese restaurants  operated by Japanese people. This is the closest experience you will get in the Charlotte/Pineville area  as if you were served in Japan. I've had their Udon & cold Soba Noodles and they are both delicious! It make me feel as if I was back in Japan. They are well know for their bento box chicken Katsu. \n\nIf you strive for an accurate Japanese food experience then look no further!"", ""So this place comes highly recommended!! It is behind my favorite Thai/Vietnamese place (Viet-Thai) and once night we thought we'd check it out.\n\nWe had a couple rolls of sushi and I had the Panko crusted Chicken and the boyfriend had the teriyaki chicken. Everything was good  but I wasn't blown away. I really wish the salad had a ginger dressing and I  may ask if they have it next time  but it has a sesame dressing. I hear they have the best Ramen in town and over half of the patrons were japanese!! That speaks volumes...  FYI he loved the place but didn't think his chicken was the best. We both agreed we'd be back to try the Ramen and Udon!!"", ""I really enjoyed my dinner: crazy tuna roll and a smoked salmon nigiri that made me so happy I became lonesome once I realized I had eaten it already.\n\nAs soon as we walked in there was a super adorable lady ready to tend to us :]\n\nEveryone was very attentive and amiable; I'm a very satisfied customer.\n\nThe place is very small but very nice and clean; I plan on coming back!"", 'Pretty tasty and very authentic.

Now I have been to Japan and the best ramen I have had in the US was in DC. I was not sure what to expect when we went to Musashi. From the outside it looked like a cheap place  with maybe adequate sushi. The inside was a whole different story. It felt genuine and warm. All the food items sounded delicious. Nothing was too salty or greasy. The stuff we ordered tasted great. I got the miso ramen which was super flavorful. The tempura shrimp was very juicy. It was not like some restaurants where the fried part overpowers the taste of the actual food. Definitely try out this restaurant!', '4 years later (since my initial review) and nothing has changed! I love love love Musashi. I highly recommend coming here for lunch  which for me  means my Saturday lunches are usually here. They usually do 3 ""specialty"" lunch boxes: Box A  B and C. A is usually a unique  homemade-esque Japanese dish. Sometimes it is katsu curry. Other times it is ramen. Sometimes it\'s a little of both and other times it\'s a bento box. Box B is usually a bento box with a wide variety of sushi dishes and Box C is usually a chirashi bowl. My usually order the A as it is always unique  authentic and delicious. Other recommendations are: katsu-don (katsu with egg and onions over rice)  grilled mackerel  chicken katsu and agedashi tofu.', ""First off  we WILL return.  This place is pretty solid on humble authentic atmosphere and recipe/presentation.  It is obviously a favorite of the Japanese-American population of Charlotte!\n\nAfter many good Yelpers guided us to this spot  we decided finally to give it a try.  A busy spot and a small restaurant.  It did not appear that they took reservations; I'm not sure.  There are two American style kotatsu tables that appear to seat up to six.  Dress in layers; this tiny joint gets cozy.\n\nWe plan to try more sushi varieties; it's right in line with prices from other places.  It's very fresh  straightforward presentation.  Timing on food coming out is decent; we didn't wait forever.  We had a couple of rolls and they were good.  Noodle bowls could be a bit more generous or perhaps a bit less expensive.  My $11 tempura udon by itself would have left me wanting.  Next time I will probably try a bento box.  My husband had the tonkatsu ramen and was pretty satisfied.\n\nThe service staff is so very nice and cheerful.  If you know Japanese (my husband does) they love to make conversation."", ""Went to this place to order the Ramen that everyone has raved about...it's too bad that I could not focus on enjoying the ramen  because the place was just too dirty and grimy! I sat in a booth close to the wall and thought for sure I would catch a fungus just by sitting too close to the dirty wall. The table was also sticky and gross!  There sanitation score was a 90 and something tells me that's pretty high for them. The ramen was just ok...but I think if you can't properly clean your tables and your walls - that something even more disgusting  disturbing and dirty is lurking in the kitchen.  I was not impressed and will never go back!"", 'My husband and I lived in Shanghai and have traveled to Japan several times... We knew the moment we walked in that this place was legit.

I worked for a Japanese company and I have taken several Japanese guests to this place. All of them claimed that the dishes are very original and they felt that they are in Tokyo.\n\nOur family eats at this place once a week. Chirazi sushi  Agedashi tofu  tonkatsu and ramen/udon are our typical order.', ""I was long anticipating going to Musashi to try the BBQ eel. It was the only place I could find that had bbq eel... however  it was only ok  especially for $20. It came with a miso soup and was served on white rice  nothing special. Service was fast for take-out. I am willing to try again and want to try the ramen (not available for take-out). But right now I'm not overly impressed."", 'Good Japanese food. The ramen is really good. Curry with pork chop is also my favorite. Lunch time food is decent. Weekend night could be crowded and you should expect long wait time.', ""So far I've only had the ramen but it is so delicious. Honestly I started craving real restaurant ramen while I was watching Naruto and it was as good as I could have imagined and I'm so glad I found a place that's in the area. I also tried their steamed dumplings as an appetizer and they tasted incredibly fresh."", 'My boyfriend and I loved this place! We both love authentic oriental food and this is at the top of the list now!

This will definitely be a new regular place for us!\n\nMake sure to get there early because it is a small location and fills up quickly in the evening!', ""So I came in for 1 thing- the eel bowl. That's what I got  and that's all I got. I expected it to be served with wasabi or ginger but nope  literally eel and rice. I asked for shrimp sauce or white sauce  they didn't have any. I was kind of disappointed. Luckily my friend ordered some sushi and hers came with wasabi and ginger so I just stole hers. What it all really boils down to is  how good is that eel? Let me tell you  it's one of the most heavenly BBQ grilled things I've put in my mouth! The eel was cut to perfection  huge portions might I add. In fact  it's hard to find places that serve such huge pieces of eel that aren't cut up. Because it was cooked whole  it makes the eel that much more tender. If you've never had eel  you must try it! It almost taste like a flakey fish such as tilapia  grilled with eel sauce  and the rice just soaks up all the deliciousness. \nBut seriously  I need shrimp sauce or white sauce. Next time I may order it Togo and get shrimp sauce from somewhere else. Problem solved!"", 'I think my expectations were a little to high on this one. I was looking for some good ramen and decided to drive across town to Musashi. Unfortunately  I was not thrilled with the ramen there. It was not bad  but not what I was looking for. I also ordered a spicy tuna roll. The roll was overpowered by mayo and was not for me. The service however was good and the staff was friendly. Just to many other better sushi places around town.', 'I asked the cashier at Hatoya for an authentic Japanese restaurant  she gave me Musashi.\n\nMy friend and I immediately wanted to check the restaurant out  only to find out that they open at 5:30pm..  We came back at 6:35pm.\n\nPlace - The establishment is small  but gosh it was packed on a Friday night at 6:45pm. One thing I have learned is to make reservations! It looked like almost more than half of the tables had ""Reserved"" signs.  There were people behind us waiting for a table.. some left.\n\nFood -\n- Tonkotsu Ramen: I was craving for some ramen  and the ramen I had ordered was alright. I was hoping for the one I had tried in NewYork or the one in Houston.  The flavor of the pork Tonkotsu Ramen was there  but just missed the mark on presentation and other ingredients. Definitely better than the others I have been to around Charlotte. \n- Tonkatsu Bento Box: My friend\'s husband loved his bento Tonkatsu box. \n- Katsu Chicken Entree: My husband had the Katsu Chicken and it was alright.  \n- Salad: The salad ginger peanut dressing was good.\n- Off the menu Shrimp Tempura Roll: Just shrimp tempura and the roll.. no.. other veggies - what?!\n\nService - They are good about getting to you  when you ask for their service..  When they are busy  it may take them just a tad bit longer to get to you.\n\nPrice - Was alright  not too shabby  and reasonable at best. \n\nSo bottom line  I like the food... but I am in no dire need to come back. I would be happy to have their food at the Japanese Festival though.   I felt bad for the people who waited around the door for the next available seat/table.

Would recomend for a good change of pace from the norm.', ""Whenever I am in Charlotte  I practically BEG my friends to take me to Musashi! For three years  I have gone to this Japanese Restaurant for their Miso Ramen and croquettes. Both of which are truly amazing! Them miso ramen always has such tender pork in it  and the broth is fantastic!\n\nMy last visit (which was last Thursday)  I finally got to sample their sushi. I have some Unagi (BBQ'ed Eel) and some Ebi (Cooked shrimp with some vinegar). I had NEVER had Unagi and Ebi that was this flavorful! The Ebi had the perfect amount of vinegar taste to it  and the Unagi had a wonderful BBQ sauce on it. The green tea they serve is always hot and a great way to compliment any meal.\n\nThe atmosphere includes a private section that is like a traditional Japanese Restaurant. it is closed off by some sliding doors. It also has  a hole under the table for you to place your legs when you sit.  The rest of the restaurant is brightly lit and a cozy feel to it.\n\nThe Staff is always friendly and kind  and you really could not ask for any better. They always feel very attentive to their customers. If your glass of tea is nearly empty  someone will be by in a few minutes to ask if you want more and then refill it.\n\nMusashi is my favorite Japanese Restaurant in all of North Carolina. It is a shame it is so far away from me  but it's worth the trip when I am in the area. if you are looking for some fantastic sushi  tempura  or ramen  this is the place to go!"", ""This is a completely legit  traditional Japanese-owned sushi restaurant  which is a bit of a rarity anywhere in the United States outside of a major city like NY  LA  Chicago  DC or Miami let alone North Carolina.

We were served after four other tables that arrived after us.  We ordered tea and water and our server forgot my tea.  The tea seems powdered.   Husband got Shoyu Ramen  and I wanted chicken katsu curry  but the chicken katsu is $8  apparently it\'s five additional dollars for the curry sauce.  So i ordered the Tempura instead.   It was very good.  We also got pork shumai  but there was hard bone bits my husband almost cracked his tooth on  and the consistency of the rest of the shumai was complete mush.  The gyoza I recieved with my Tempura was very good.   We ordered an additional side of gyoza and those came with barely any sauce and were burned black on the bottom.  His noodles were very good  firm  stretchy  chewy  delicious.

The staff is owned and run by a Japanese family -- huge plus  especially nowadays where you\'ve got all these ""japanese"" restaurants run by Chinese  Korean or the East Asian people. It\'s always a good sign when you see other Japanese diners dining there. The ambience is simple and unassuming  allowing the food to speak for itself. The food here is AUTHENTIC! The sushi chef is intimidating looking and very serious about what he does. The sushi and sashimi are all very good - chirashi bowl  sashimi a la carte (uni  yellowtail  salmon roe  salmon  tuna). Their rolls taste fantastic too. We always go with the spicy yellowtail  Cali rolls and soft shell crab with avocado. Their cooked items are delicious too: grilled mackerel and fried squid legs apps  any of their ramen and udon bowls or their soba noodles. Pair any of these items with some sake or beer.\n\nFYI - They take reservations and have a large separate room (shoes must be taken off) with two tables that can seat 8-10 ppl each. For these tables  you sit on the floor and legs can hang below. They have set lunch and dinner hours  and never pick up the phone unless they\'re open and not too busy.

So are their bento boxes  I'll usually order their grilled mackerel.  And yes  their sushi is also really good.

I enjoy restaurants that are run and frequented by people who know the food well. My friend and I came here on a Thursday night around 8:30pm and were the only souls in the place. Let me also say how hard it was to find this place. Granted  it was raining and dark  but their sign was not lit and was hard to see amoungst the other places in this strip/suite mall. I was anxious to try the ramen noodles since it was a cold  rainy night and it sounded very comfortable  like memories from college days. The bowl was very large but could have used more noodles. I don't eat pork and there were 3 hefty slices in the bowl which my friend gladly ate. Overall the ramen tasted good  but there could have been much more noodles and less broth. This would be a great meal to eat if you had a cold or wanted to be warmed quickly. My friend had the squid salad which was pretty good. We also had 3 different sushi rolls which were named after a baseball theme. The spicy tuna roll was pretty bland. It was wrapped in tuna and had spicy tuna in the middle of the rice roll. The tempura shrimp roll was good but a little large to eat with chopsticks or even your fingers! We also had some sort of avocado and crab roll which was fairly decent. Overall this place was just ok. I may be back for some take out ramen but honestly I could probably just make my own at home for 95 cents and add some veggies."", ""We had high expectations because the first time we came here they were pack full and we didn't want to wait for a table so went somewhere else.  We came back today and right at the beginning the service was terrible.  The older lady looks like she hated life and was rude.  The other servers seemed okay but the main one that took care of us was awful.  Food was okay.  When does it become acceptable to give bad service?"", ""I haven't had Japanese food this amazing since high school. Amazing  absolutely amazing food  it felt like I was being welcomed into a home."", ""My wife and I don't normally go to Japanese restaurants because we don't know too much about them. How ever  going to this restaurant was a delightful experience.  family-orientated . sushi bar service  and full service table dining.  staff was very attentive . It was crowded  about 90% Japanese  so that kind of tells you the quality of food served there.  we will go there again"", ""This place is amazing!  But if youre looking for hibachi and white sauce this isn't you're place. This is authentic and I love it. They don't even have white sauce here"", ""Musashi holds a special place in my heart and I can't believe I haven't blown up their yelp page with my review! This restaurant is family-owned and has been a part of the Charlotte community for at least 10 years. Musashi has and will always be my go-to place for simple  fresh and authentic. No sizzing grill  no fancy chefs or crazy tricks  just the core of Japanese cuisine. \n\nSome friends and I decided to go to Musashi for dinner last Saturday. I've been craving their sashimi for weeks! They use the most high quality and best part of the fish so every single bite keeps you wanting more. Salmon is my favorite. Trust me  I kept yearning for a chance to go back. If you're more adventurous  I recommend the beef tongue! If you've never had beef tongue  it is soft yet slightly chewy. The pieces are sliced and the flavors just melt in your mouth! I don't think it's on the menu  but you can always ask the friendly staff. Sadly  they ran out on this occasion. We've also tried the Fukahire Salad (marinated shark fin/jelly fish salad)  grilled sardines and a few other appetizers  but the sashimi and beef tongue are my favorites as far as appetizers. What can I say  we're some adventurous eaters!\n\nNow.. for the main course! My absolute favorite is the Katsu-jyu  which is fried breaded pork cutlet with egg and onions  served over a bed of rice. A jyu box is actually the Japanese's traditional method of presenting food (how cool!). If you're not much of a pork fan  I would go with the Chicken-katsu. If you're in the mood for some soup or traditional ramen  the Tonkatsu ramen is also delicious! It is cooked in a pork bone base and served with Japanese egg noodle  roasted pork slices  bamboo shoot and green onions. Yummm.. this is definitely not where you want to stroll in and ask for a hibachi grill and shrimp sauce!\n\nBefore I talk about dessert  I have to say that a meal at Musashi is more of an experience. There are so many varieties that keeps you wanting more. Many Japanese restaurants are Americanized and that special authenticity of the cuisine is lost. I'm glad to say that Musashi still holds its roots close to the traditional culture. Ready for the end of this food adventure? Green tea or red bean ice cream is the only way to end this perfect meal!"", ""This review is a long time a comin but here it is either way. In my first few months I found myself in Charlotte  all alone on Yom Kippur  which is the jewish holiday where we fast for the entire day  thats right an entire day. Basically  the entire day you dream about what you are going ot eat for dinner  which makes it even more excruciating. By 8pm (1.5 hours past sun down) I decided on Musashi after a colleague reccomended it earlier  she had told me of a secret japanese menu  and fresh fish.\n\nWell I can tell you this place has BOTH! And the best part  is the head chef there and owner  is quite japanese  and began his career in my home city's (Toronto) first ever sushi restaurant in the early 80s. Suffice to say  I was pretty sold after talking to this guy \n\nThe japanese menu is off the chain and features japanese favourites like broth meat and raw egg in a hot pot (not sure what the name of that is)   they are a little hesitant to let you order off of it but I've been 3 times and just asked the waitress what she reccomended and have never had a bad item. \n\nProbably one of the best Sushi places in the city along with sushi guru  yet to try new zealand which i also heard was great."", ""I finally found some legitimate tonkotsu ramen in Charlotte! It wasn't bland or watery and the pork (chashu?) was savory and delicious. I would definitely come back  though it is a little far out from the city (20 min drive).\n\nYou'll notice that the interiors of this restaurant make a particular effort to imitate a japanese home. There's a private dining room  which appears to be a small compartment with traditional tatami mats  sliding doors and pillows.The owners are also japanese  which is always a good sign in my books if you're looking for some lip-smacking ramen. \n\nThe menu offers a variety of delicacies from Japan  ranging from potato croquettes (with the delicious bulldog brand sauce) to gyoza and even mini fried crabs. Ramen is by far  the best dish on the menu and you even get a choice between the broths  soy  miso  tonkotsu etc.\n\nThe process for making tonkotsu broth is incredibly laborious and takes a lot of skill to perfect. I would say Musashi does the japanese broth justice by delivering the almost-creamy texture of the broth  filled with the rich flavor of pork. The soup also has a great milky-color. Unfortunately the noodles aren't hand made and you can tell they're more of an upgraded version of instant ramen noodles. However  this does not deter from the overall experience of eating a hot bowl. I didn't leave one drop!\n\nThe restaurant serves alcohol  but not past a certain hour (like 9 or 10)  so you can enjoy a range of japanese beers and saki. Perfect accompaniment to dinner. Prices are very reasonable and the hospitality is fantastic. Food is served in a timely fashion and everything tastes phenomenal. \n\nI'm already looking forward to the next time I come back!\n\n4/5"", 'It seems a rarity to find a Japanese restaurant owned and operated by Japanese. Well Musashi is one such place. The menu is not the Americanized and that is worth three stars alone. Good authentic menu  service and food!', ""This is the only place to go for Japanese food in Charlotte! We are regulars so we are treated very well  I don't know what the others complain about...the service seems very good to me. The food is great!"", 'An adorable family owned restaurant. This small Japanese serves a traditional Japanese meal that keeps you coming back for more. A must try .', 'Arrived  party of 6 on a Wednesday night. Host would not acknowledge our presence  wasted :30 mins of our time figuring out whether we could get a table or not.\n\nTerrible service.', ""Reman was good  but the sashimi I ordered was hard do describe ... It doesn't look very fresh  the cut is not clear  and it's the first time I know that tuna sashimi can be chewy..."", ""This restaurant is nestled in a little shopping center  but don't let the locale deceive you. The food here is outstanding - I got a musashi bento box (probably should have went lighter on the soup and salad I had beforehand) with some sort of citrusy wine. Everything was excellent - it looks to be a family-owned business as well  and it shows with the excellent and courteous service (of course  the place is usually busy  so don't come here expecting fast food  but our order arrived within reasonable time). Do check this place out!"", ""I've only been here once  but this place impressed me. The service was a bit slow  but the Lunch Special A I had was very very tasty. Well  the ramen had somewhat of a weird taste in the soup  but the katsu don served over rice was....I've never had better katsu don. I would eat it again. Most sushi restaurants I've gone to were owned by Koreans or Americans  but I think this place is authentically Japanese including the workers and owner. Definitely recommend it."", ""It took a few visits before I felt comfortable with the staff at Musashi - I don't think they're intentionally unfriendly  they just don't go that extra mile. Once you get to know them though  from waitstaff  to sushi chef to kitchen guy - they're super nice. But let's get to the real reason why you should go to this place - the food. I think it's the most legit Japanese in Charlotte (primarily because the place is dominated by Japanese patrons).\n\nAgedashi Tofu - broth is to die for and the tofu so  delicately breaded\nSea Snails - one again  boiled/steamed in sake and the shells put out a delicious broth on their own. Texture similar to conch.\nDumplings - I usually don't love dumplings in Japanese restaurants  but these are delightful little morsels that are worth an order.\n\nSushi/Sashimi is outstanding - they have all of the standard stuff and prices are pretty reasonable.\nSoba/Udon - delicious noodles and clear or dark broth...haven't tried the cold Soba  but that's my next step. \n\nThere is a traditional Japanese menu on the back of the regular menu  and I told the waitress that  next time she can help me order from that non-Gaijin menu!! She said she would be happy to do so!\n\nTo heck with the strip mall atmosphere - this is just a great little gem in South Charlotte for sushi lovers who don't want to dress up like they're going clubbing don't want disco balls and sake bombs (sorry Nikko and Enso)."", ""Words can't express how good this place is fo authentic Sushi.\n\nIt opens at 530.. we get there at 515 and there's a line ... Everytime... Don't let the looks fool you."", ""Well  here goes my first review to chronicle my life-long love affair with food. I had in mind trying something new because how awfully long some reviews turn out to be - kinda like the length of this introduction. So  bottomline  I'm going to begin with a five words or less review. \n\nAuthentic. Attentive. Explore the appetizers.\n\nThis place fills me with nostalgia. The menu selection and execution remind me of my mom's dishes and the local mom & pop establishments tucked away in the underbelly of Japan.\n\nYou won't get a show with your teppan yaki  but what you will get is authentic  and delicious Japanese food. \n\nIf you are looking to get past the more well known dishes and expand your experience with Japanese food  I'd recommend the agedashi dofu  grilled mackerel (get a side of rice with it)  and nabe udon. \n\nAll in all after three times here  I've left with a feeling of happiness - due to some part of not having a rice cooker here nor a car to drive to the Japanese market - that hasn't surfaced in quite some time  even back home in Long Beach  CA.\n\nThe only disappointment was the tonkotsu ramen. The broth needs some work. \n\n5 stars."", 'Simple. No sushi in Charlotte at this point beats them. Ask for Bunta and the Japanese menu. We have been eating there for years. Rusan himself eats there (We ran into him going in to eat one night).', ""If you go for lunch  I recommend getting either A or B. They have a display of the 2 boxes in the front that you can check out. It is such a good deal  you only pay about 8 bucks for either box. The lunch sushi box B comes with 10 pieces of sushi  6 regular rolls  2 larger ones  2 slices of sashimi on rice  some kind of mayo based salad  miso soup  and peanut sauce salad. Box A usually comes with a rice and meat dish and a ramen soup  although it can vary many days. Both are mouth watering.\n     For dinner  I love to get the Nabeyaki Udon Noodle. It is awesome  it comes out burning hot so you have to be careful. You cannot take this to go  so be sure to finish it. It has egg and lots of vegetables  and tempura shrimp and tempura veggies. The dinner teriyaki bento box is very good  but a california roll is the only option for the sushi portion. Other things I enjoy are the pork katsu-don  ramen  curry katsu  and the agedashi dofu is excellent. Really  no matter what you pick  you can't go wrong. \n    On a rare occasion  most likely in the winter  be sure to check out the sushi specials. If they have TORO tuna(fatty tuna)  be sure to get it without any questions  and do not get the roll  just get the whole slab. Its really expensive but it melts in your mouth. Worth every penny.\n    Overall  Musashi is a great place with pretty good prices  Lunch is definitely cheaper than dinner. It is in a small but comfortable and not too fancy place. But when the food is that good  it doesn't really matter. It doesn't have any of the over-the-top sushi roll specials  but rather it is just rolled well with perfectly cooked rice. It is the most authentic Japanese place in Charlotte that I have come across."", 'Today I had an absolutely horrible experience at Musashi Japanese restaurant on Johnston Road  Charlotte.\nWaitress were impolite  unfriendly wearing some dirty shoes which should be already a red flag sign  but I was hungry  and I thought ""not a big deal"". Well  it turned out to be a big deal.\nWhere are the traditional appropriate for any type of services smiles? Where is the traditional Japanese hospitality you see in other restaurants? It was anything like that!!!\n When a hostess found out that I am alone she set me at the small uncomfortable table while the restaurant was nearly empty. \nI asked to be seated at another table  and hostess started arguing. I repeat  the restaurant was nearly empty  and who says  if you come alone you don\'t deserve a better seat?\nI looked at the menu  and asked questions about some dishes  but waitresses did not speak English  and they could not explain me anything.\nI ordered a CHICKEN TERIYAKI. The dish looked very unattractive: big chunks of lettuce  and  potato salad which I did not order  and nobody asked me  if I want one on a side; the taste was even worse!!! I ate CHICKEN TERIYAKI in many other Japanese restaurants before  and this is a delicious dish  but not in this terrible place.\nOn the top of that I saw a bug crawling across the table. I killed it  and I called a manager. Waitress started arguing with me again!! \nI did not see any smiles  and I did not hear ""I\'m sorry"".

The restaurant is quaint warm  and cozy. I was originally looking for a more generic Japanese meal like teriyaki chicken with broccoli  fried rice and shrimp sauce. The food they serve was not what I expected but was still delicious. It seemed like more authentic Japanese and was very fresh and tasted amazing. The chicken teriyaki was served with soup salad  rice and noodles. The most outstanding part was the service. They went over and above to make sure we were taken care of! I highly recommend it!', ""This place has nice tonkotsu ramen. The broth is creamy  rich  and it looks like they invest a lot of time producing the broth.

Without any other restaurants in the area that serve anything ""japanese"" besides sushi  It\'s great that they serve ramen and tonkatsu  but they were only fair. Unfortunately the service suffered too  as they are understaffed. \n\nThis place has potential but I will probably not be coming back for a while.', ""Where should start? Parking is abundant in this tiny strip of stores. Musashi is  from what I've experienced  is an authentic Japanese-family-run establishment. Having Japanese parents and having lived in Nara for a part of my life  I longed for the real Japanese taste in food. U can taste it in their Miso soup made with dashi. U can taste it in their croquette dipped in tonkatsu sauce. Mmmm. When I check out a new Japanese restaurant  I always go for the chirashi to see what hidden treasure I might discover and boy I think I had MIRUGAI in it!!! I don't think I was dreaming!?!!  Back in Japan  I missed the chirashi which had unique sashimi pieces like even awabi!!! This natsukashii omoi... Arigatoo Musashi! I will be back most certainly. It is not a fancy restaurant. Its portions do not speak in volume but rather in flavor. If you've bn to Japanese restaurants run by Chinese  you will b able to taste the difference. Some people rate by volume value. This is rated by aji flavor value."", ""Very authentic Japanese food. Highly recommend for anyone looking to experience real Japanese cuisine. Not your typical Teriyaki or Hibachi steak kind of place. For someone who lived in Japan Musashi will feel just like home. And for those who hasn't it will be a rewarding experience.

Personally I like the tonkatsu ramen and all the bento items. Unagi (broiled eel) here is just ok', ""Mixed review. I was expecting more  but left a bit disappointed. First of all  the directions from Google maps is a bit off...it takes you through an apartment complex to a dead end. It's located in a shopping center (with Food Lion). \n\nThe atmosphere is small with humble interior design. There are approximately 4 booths with high backs and hard bottoms with worn out cushions. \n\nThe greeting was all smiles. The service wasn't fast  but not too slow either. Our drinks were always full and the server was very friendly.\n\nThe sushi list was limited  but priced well. The spicy tuna roll was very good. Do not order the teriyaki chicken unless you like two marinated chicken breasts with sauce on top served with a cup of rice and a side of lettuce with ginger dressing for $12. Very disappointing. The restaurant was fairly busy  so I'm sure they have better dishes. I'll have to go back and try some of the noodle items."", ""I would say this place was just okay for me. Nothing to amazing  but the server was nice. My husband did not like his sushi very much but I liked my vegetable tempura. Our son did not eat most of his bento box and did not like his steak very much either.  Maybe it was an off night or maybe it was just not as good a quality as they are used to  either way I don't think we will be back."", ""I've seen quite a few mixed reviews of Musashi and I can honestly say that you can easily identify the two categories of reviewers: those who understand Japanese culture or have been to Japan and everyone else.\n\nI'm a bit of a food purist - I feel that if you are going to eat Japanese food  than it had better be at a Japanese restaurant with a Japanese chef. The same can be applied to other ethnic cuisines; I mean if you were on vacation in France  would you honestly eat French food in France that is prepared by an American? No.\n\nRanting aside  Musashi has the best bowl of Ramen I've had since leaving Japan. Period. The wife's à la carte selections were also equally as tasty including the homemade dipping sauces - the effort they put in really makes the difference. \n\nI've seen another review here on Yelp and I'll echo it here - you have to flag down your waitress and this is to be expected as it is how Japanese restaurants operate.  Don't knock them on service without understanding the culture. \n\nI'll end the review with this: if you think Hibachi is Japanese food  then Musashi may not be for you; however  if you are seeking an authentic Japanese experience Izakaya  style  then look no further."", 'The food and atmosphere was quite charming. \n Had the ramen soup and it was very light and flavorful. Highly recommend to try this quaint little place', ""I am so thankful that this no-frills Japanese place exists. I just came back from my first visit for lunch and clearly they know what their doing when it comes to noodles and soups. I ordered their pork-based ramen soup with a squid salad.

The place is very small..."", ""It's an OK place for Japanese food and less than OK for sushi. \n\nThe Agedashi tofu was very good (lightly fried tofu in a light soy sauce). And the cold soba noodles were good. I ordered the uni and salmon nigiri and that turned out to be barely OK. But what was quite off-putting was the $2.95 cost PER piece of salmon nigiri. I'd expect it's more like $4.50 to $5 for two pieces. So for $2.95 per piece of nigiri salmon to be rated as good  it's going to have to be pretty good  and unfortunately I'd rank it as even less than average. It's soft  pink  non-fatty and flavor-less flesh was sub-par compared to what I'm used to having. And I'll say that this one experience with this particular order does overall color my opinion.

But  my brother and sister-in-law weren\'t too impressed. I think Musashi is good  solid Japanese food. Nothing too fancy. What they did they did well. Their agadeshi tofu is the standard against which all other fried tofus are measured. Light  crisp  with a flavorful  but not too salty  sauce. The katsudon is how it should be  hot  eggy  with just the right amount of gravy to flavor the rice.

The other was a mini version of the dinner bento box.) \n\nTo the reviewers who had poor sushi experiences  claiming the rolls are similar to the pre-packaged ones at the supermarket  and un-fresh: I urge you to try Musashi again. I always find the rice perfect and room-temperature and seasoned well. Also: to those who complain the sushi menu is small  yes  it's less than a page.  However  who wants a phone-book-sized-menu if the food isn't good? \n\n(If you want to talk supermarket sushi  DYK restaurants like Soul Gastrolounge actually serve the supermarket brand as their own...and nobody knows!  In fact  it's pretty good  considering.) \n\nI also don't think the service is unfriendly at all!  Maybe being busy and task-oriented (not taking time to chit-chat) is mistaken for unfriendliness...I duno  I just call it efficient! \n\nTIP #2: You can't get their udon or ramen to-go.\n\nBottom Line:  If you're accustomed to some noodle houses in New York or LA  or in cities with large Asian communities  no  this place isn't going to be on the same level-- but sometimes you don't need all the frills.  Just a solid meal  run by a family you can tell knows what they're doing."", ""I used to like Musashi back in the days I lived in Charlotte. My Japanese teachers would tell me to go here and a lot of people who knew about the culture would recommend here. I remember my first time at Musashi I saw the most Japanese people in Charlotte ever and I started to believe that it must be the closest one to have the authentic taste.\n\nWell so from my old memories I visited again with my mom but only to prove myself wrong.\n\nThe lady wasn't so friendly but I don't mind she was like that all the time. We sat ourselves at the bar and ordered a spider roll and another roll I don't remember  a tempura udon  and a chicken katsu. \n\nI got to see the sushi guy making my rolls and thought to myself wtf is he making? There was no delicacy. I was surprised when he handed me the dish. I obviously wasn't happy to see the result. The rolls were warm like there was no sushi rice. It was just regular white rice so it pretty much tasted awful especially with not much crab. The amount of rice was ridiculous I thought I was eating onigiri  or rice ball.\n\nThen my chicken katsu and my mom's udon came out. The chicken katsu was just what I was expecting  nothing more nor nothing less. Rice  chicken  salad  additional side item and this time was tuna pasta salad? and miso soup. It was good. Just normal chicken katsu. Not so crispy this time. The portion is pretty big. My mom liked the udon. The broth was clear and light color  the tempuras came out on a separate plate. Tempuras were just ok. \n\nThe sushi was very disappointing but the rest was fine. I don't know if I'll comeback when I'm in town again. Maybe to get the katsu if I crave some teishoku style meal bc its my comfort food. But definitely no sushi at Musashi. I just want to say that just because it's owned by Japanese don't automatically assume that it'll be good."", 'This is the only authentic Japanese place in Charlotte. I lived in Japan for 3 years and I can tell you first hand this is a close as it gets without spending $2000 for airfare! The food is awesome. The people are awesome. The place rocks!\n\nTo all the people giving this place 3 stars and complaining that the chicken was not great and the salad should have had ginger dressing.....this is an authentic Japanese restaurant. Not the American Hibachi down the street. Japanese is not a big room with large grills with guys flinging food all over the place creating small fires. That is an American Invention and THIS is what Japanese food tastes like and how it is served. But then again American Stupidity on what other cultures food tastes like knows no bounds....TACO BELL?\n\nThe service is always perfect. I love the staff there. They let me practice my Japanese and are always excited when I get it right. To the people saying the ""service is slow""  The service is slower because you are supposed to talk to each other and enjoy your company and not scarf down your food like a couple of baka gaijin. It\'s Japanese!\n\nAgain hands down the best place in Charlotte to get authentic JAPANESE FOOD like it is served in Japan in every small town and small food/bar in the country. This is NOT American style Japanese it\'s AUTHENTIC!\n\n優秀食品！', 'Truly authentic Japanese food. The staff is always friendly and welcoming. Their ramen and udon are both very solid. The bento boxes give you a chance to sample a little of everything and they are delicious. My personal favorites are the gyoza and pork shumai. I have been known to order them for dessert while the wife prefers the green tea ice cream. If you crave Japanese go check them out  you will not be disappointed.', 'Authentic and best ramen in Charlotte. Dining area is small but the lunch specials are inexpensive and delicious.', 'My family has been loyally going here about 1-2 times a week for  about 10 years:) The most authentic  family-style run Japanese restaurant you´ll find.', ""It's been a few years since I've come here  but I know it has good sushi so I invited 5 friends.  We tried the pork ramen and udon soups for the first time.  They were ok  but lacking the flavor I was expecting as if the broth was made some time ago and then the ingredients thrown in that day. We all got softshell crab rolls and liked them.  My Hornet Roll was very good and the tuna and yellowtail rolls were also very good.  The staff is super nice and the quaint little paper room was great to have our group.  We will be back for more sushi"", 'Nice lunch specials: one with warm items and one with sushi.\n\nSushi chef and waitresses speaking Japanese with customers.\n\nFree wifi from neighboring businesses.', ""I've heard this restaurant from listening to NPR in Charlotte  so I went and invited some of my friends and decided to come here to check it out. Here are my reviews.\n\nVenue - the ambiance inside the restaurant is like being in Japan. If you have a large group of people  your group will be sitting as if you're sitting on a floor  but your not. The sits are elevated and the center piece is wide open. It's a comfortable sitting arrangement.\n\nSushi - the Unagi (Eel) was cooked perfectly. The softcrab shells are not bad  but I had better ones before.  The rice was cooked very well not to sticky or clumpy. They need better selections in sushi.\n\nPresentation - the restaurant lacks in presentation.  It was a very simple dish put together.  \n\nSake - they are pricey. $15.00 minimum. \n\nRamen - the soup was very tasty.  \n\nOverall   if you are craving for ramen  this is the best place so far I've tasted. As for sushi  I would only come here once. I've had much better sushi with awesome presentation and much better selections in California before.  I still have yet to find a sushi that will replace my experienced in California. Also  if you don't tip enough. You will be called back in by the waitress asking you to add more on the tip. Its a MANDATORY!!!  It feels like a teacher is about to scold you."", ""After failing at Mr Tokyo  I chose another Japanese place. I wanted to treat my parents to a nice dinner. Musashi seated us promptly but soon thereafter was told any sushi or sashimi would take  a min of 40min!!! My parents of course said it was ok and ordered a bento box. I ended up eating nothing and felt like so bummed out that I couldn't order half the menu. Never eating Japanese in Charlotte ever again!!"", ""Upfront disclosures:\nI am a sushi snob  and am extremely particular about my sushi.\n\nI am going to break my review into two parts - Typical Japanese food and sushi.  \n\nTypical Japanese food: We ordered some pork shumai that were pretty good  but was served with a brown-wasabi-type paste.  It tasted like wasabi  but why the hell was it brown? We also ordered pan fried pork with kimchi.  The kimchi was very spicy  but good.  The pork was a bit tough.  \n\nThey have a whole list of special appetizers  but only about 4 were translated into english.  My girlfriend asked for more translation  but the waiter told us we really wouldn't be interested in them  so we dropped the conversation on it. \n\nMy gut tells me this place has very good  and very authentic Japanese food  but I am not experienced enough in non-sushi Japanese food.  \n\nOn to the sushi:  We chose this restaurant due to the reviews on Yelp.  We eat a ton of sushi and were excited to try a new place.  \n\nMusashi has a very small sushi menu.  There are few rolls to choose from  and a medium sized menu for sashimi and nigiri.  \n\nWe ordered salmon and tuna nigiri.  The fish was cut rather sloppily  and my girlfriend is not convinced that we actually had salmon.  The salmon was all pink  no typical white-fat lines....  why?\n\nThe rolls come in pieces of 3  which I find weird.  I am typically used to larger rolls with 6 or 8 pieces.  It really felt that the food was made hours before and then served up  as the rice was cold and solid - not like sushi rolled right in front of you. \n\nWe have not been back.  If you're looking for really  really  really authentic Japanese food  I would head here and try.  if you're looking for a great sushi experience  I would try other places in the area."", 'This place was incredible! Everything I tried  I loved. I highly recommend the pork ramen. I could eat that everyday.', ""The reason I'm giving Musashi a 4-star review is because I love their ramen noodles  as well as their appetizers.  They taste amazing!\n\nHowever  the sushi is down right awful.  It's cold and tasteless  kind of like supermarket sushi.  After eating sushi at Musashi twice  I gave up.  So the only reason I go back is to have their amazing appetizers  and ramen noodles.\n\nThe service is quite cold and unfriendly.  I am not the type to want any chitchat between customer and server  but the ladies there are quite cold  unresponsive  and slow.  I prefer efficient service  no chit chat  no upselling.  They tend to ignore you  which is fine  until you want to leave  and they still ignore you."", 'Just an update  still great food... Prices have scooted up over the past couple of years. Lunch box is 10 something now and Nabeyaki udon is 15', ""Best sushi in town. Apparently they are the most authentic japanese restaurant in Charlotte having hired one of the best sushi chefs. I'm not sure if that's true  but the sushi is amazing. If you go during lunch they have a special for $8.50 and is more than enough food to eat. \n\nMy only complaint is that they don't have fountain sodas - so if you order  you're getting a can. But this doesn't stop me from giving this place 5 stars b/c of the food is that good."", 'Seriously this place is a diamond in the rough! \n\nOkay  so we were taken here when we visited before we moved by friends who lived in Japan for 30 years. It is legit Japanese-owned family-style restaurant  and their food is both beautiful aesthetically and amazing tastes! Can I say UMAMI??? Umm if you even slightly know anything about Japanese food  go here! You will not be disappointed. Both their sushi and dishes are delicious! \n\nYes it is true that the language can be a barrier if you try to edit things  but there is a younger guy who works there that is helpful and speaks perfect english. I personally am learning Japanese  but I just go with the flow!\n\nOn the downside  trying to call during hours in between openings (i.e. 2-5pm) is to no avail  and so reservations (highly recommended) are harder to make ahead of time. I would suggest calling when they are open towards the evening. \n\nAnyway  try it!', 'If you are looking for the best Japanese Restaurant in Charlotte  this will be the best one. It is owned by a Japanese family  it has most authentic Japanese restaurant in Charlotte. They have all the traditional dishes and sushi.

It is never too crowded and the service is always excellent.  They are open on Mondays when most places with ramen aren't.  The service is quick and friendly.\n\nI love the ramen.

The broth for the ramen is so flavorful  it's like you just can't get enough.  \n\nParking is easy with a large shared lot.  The restaurant inside is clean  cozy  and comfortable.  Always very happy with my visits here."", ""A cute little place!! And really yummy authentic Japanese food.\n\nIt's hard to find an authentic Asian cuisine around Charlotte  there are many good sushi and hibachi places  but there's always a little something that makes the restaurant a bit more of a Asian American fusion. Musashi is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte because it is one of the most authentic restaurants (both in the interior and the food)  and the servers are attentive. I frequent this restaurant on a weekly/bi-weekly basis :)"", ""Delicious worth the drive from Huntersville.  Best Sushi I've had in a while. The Shuman dumplings were perfect. Very traditional Japanese.   Red bean ice cream for desert pleasant surprise"", ""Great place I've been in north Carolina for 3 years now and I've seen this place and was always scared to go in due to it looking small. Well   the hell with the outside! Best Japanese food 8 charlotte and authentic."", ""If you are looking for the most authentic Japanese food in the Charlotte area  this is your place. While it is in a strip mall  once we walked in  we were greeted with smiles and told to sit anywhere. The first thoughts we had were of Japan while looking at the decor. Our server was very attentive and helpful. Absolutely no complaint about service here!\n\n We have been here twice. The first time  we both got the tonkatsu ramen with a gyoza appetizer. The gyoza were perfect - served with a chile oil and soy sauce. The ramen was delicious and fresh with mushrooms  half an egg  three pieces of pork that were very tender  a piece of fish cake  and noodles with a lovely chewy texture. The broth tasted of every one of those things - a warm  inviting flavor. \n\nThe second visit  I got the tonkatsu ramen again  while my daughter got the tonkatsu bento box. Her box came with a whole tonkatsu  4pc. California roll  2 shrimp tempora  4 pc. vegetable tempora  a seaweed salad  miso soup  a small salad  a shrimp dumpling  a pork dumpling  and an egg roll. Needless to say  we had enough food for lunch the next day. Those two meals  plus sweetened tea for two  came to almost 42.00. For the atmosphere  the friendly service  and the authentic food  I can't wait to go back and try the river eel over rice! Please don't pass this one by!"", ""Authentic Japanese items on the menu that you don't see at other Japanese restaurants. My favorites items have to be the ramen. It's way better ramen than futobuta in South End. We enjoyed sitting at the sushi bar and watching the sushi chef create beautiful dishes.

Also has potato croquets - five stars. Service was excellent as well !!!', 'This place is authentic- the service is perfect   my favorite drink cones to the table before I ask- they know all their customers \nKeep up the great work!!! \nOh great sushi by the way!!', ""Super authentic casual Japanese restaurant.  Its accessible bento boxes and katsu dishes earn it plaudits  but the more rarefied fish (both grilled and rare) are what attract me.  \n\nThe staff is Japanese and the walls are covered in Japanese baseball regalia near the sushi bar.  They take some time to warm up  but the servers and sushi chefs will eventually crack a smile.  The crowd is fairly brutal ordering a motley assortment of spicy rolls and fried dishes  but I suppose that's unsurprising.\n\nMusashi is very casual  and so one needs to excuse the floppy menus  powdered wasabi and pink ginger.   Where they spend their money is carrying an assortment of fish.  Here's a rundown on what I had:\n\n- Sashimi platter - I ordered a la cart a large sampling  but you can do one piece each so everything's very small portion wise.   As I said...authentic!\n- Anago - delicious  buttery\n- ika - squid was a highlight  very light and with a touch of crunch\n- surf clam - also delicious  I was feeling their bivalves.   They cater to the Japanese palette\n- tako - fresh and delicately flavorful.  I chomped on it with some shiso leaf and lemon which added zest  \n- ebi - slightly more flavorful than usual\n- saba - marinated and tasty\n- hamachi  sake  hirame  maguro - fairly standard although the salmon was better than expected\n- ikura - I got this sushi style and was delighted by the freshness and the sushi rice is great here.  A good touch of mirin and served slightly above room temperature.  \n\nI thought the knife work could have been prettier with the sashimi  however  the selection and relative freshness were both very good.  They didn't have any special fish such as toro - they said that specials come in during the weekends.   They were out of uni too but sea urchin is not in season apparently.  \n\n- hamachi Kama - very fresh  not previously frozen  cooked with some interesting spices \n- mackerel - grilled and salted to perfection.  Inside secret they get very good mackerel and cook it perfectly so fatty  juicy interior with a crisp skin\n- sanma - a little bit of a pain to eat  since I don't do the guts  however  some lemon brings to life and a simply flavorful light fish"", ""Tried this restaurant on the recommendation of a friend.  We had the vegetable tempura  tonkotsu ramen  and chicken katsu cutlet.  I will update this review as necessary after trying the sushi side of their menu.\n\nPros:\n\n- The food here is authentic.  I am not Japanese  but this restaurant's dishes taste identical to those I tasted when visiting Osaka/Tokyo.  As far as I know  this place is the only restaurant in the Charlotte area with authentic ramen noodle soups.\n-It seems they make their own tonkatsu sauce.  It was not as sweet as the bottled version that is available from Asian grocery stores.  The perfectly balanced tonkatsu sauce was a pleasant surprise. \n-Service was good  and food came out very quickly.  The entrees came out before we were finished with the tempura appetizer.\n-Price is reasonable  perhaps a touch high.\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n-The restaurant space is cramped.  Musashi crams as many 2 and 4 person tables into the space that they can.  There is a large area dedicated for tatami room style dining.  That area was not in use and made the restaurant seem like a suboptimal arrangement/floorplan.\n-The restrooms are single person restrooms.  They are located behind the kitchen and when I checked the floors leading to the restrooms were sticky  presumably from spilled food/drink.\n-The portion sizes are not consistent.  The tempura appetizer(notably no onion rings) was about 7-8 small vegetables  which I consider to be small.  The chicken cutlet portion was gigantic  containing two chicken breasts along with two generous portions of sides.  My ramen was just the right size.""]"

Where were the pretty little cupcakes pictured in previous yelp posts? Where's the whimsy? I picked out a red velvet today which was moist and good  not bad  but not all that special in cake or icing. For two dollars a pop  the icing could have used a bit more effort in piping.

I said I wanted edible bones and edible pictures of x-rays on the cake since I was going to school for radiography. It was a total mess  one of the most disappointing experiences of my life. We paid over 150$ to have literally pieces of paper that were printed off the computer be put onto my cake ! And the fondant bones looked like a third grader molded them. It was absolutely heart breaking. Especially considering how well the girl made it seem like she understood. I have voices my complaints and told them exactly what this cake came out to be and they never even said sorry. I like supporting local businesses but this place is a sham. Worst experience ever.

Some friends from Phoenix came down and wanted to meet at Carluccio\'s for a group dinner. When I arrived at the parking lot  I was in awe. This place was ostentatious and gorgeous....just the way I like it. I felt like I was in on an old Vegas secret and someone was going to hand me a briefcase full of cash for me to do something illegal with. Carluccio\'s is right next to the Liberace museum (something I need to go see) and apparently Liberace designed the interior. The interior was gold all over  hanging lights  dark lighting  dark carpets....I loved it. This is a great place to have a small dinner/family gathering. \n\nNow for the food/service. Service was average. My water glass was always full  the waiter took our order fast and the service was pleasant. Unfortunately  the waiter we had made me nervous. I asked if the Caesar salad was vegetarian and he said yes. Then I confirmed if it had anchovies (as many authentic Ceasars do) and he said ""Oh yeah...it does."" But he was quick to tell me the other dressings that would suit me. The food also took forever to come out. I ordered a mixed green salad with thousand island (side salad) and an eggplant parmigiana. The mixed green came with about a gallon of thousand island on it rendering it inedible. I like my dressing but I also like to see my salad. Perhaps I should have ordered dressing on the side but I did not expect that much. The eggplant parmigiana (served with spaghetti with marinara) was very good. Fried to the right extent and with a gorgeous piece of melted mozzarella on top and drowned in tasty marinara  this was comfort food that hit all the right stops. \n\nEveryone else on the table thoroughly enjoyed their meals. The portion sizes were huge. I mean  I could have eaten my parmigiana for about 4 meals. No exaggeration here. I later realized that they do have half orders for some of the menu. So ask about that if you\'re a light eater. The meal was also priced very very reasonably. My parmigiana was 12.99 and my husband\'s spaghetti with marinara was 8.99. \n\nThe dinner also came with a magician who entertained us for a little bit. The guy was pretty good at what he did (card tricks  disappearing money that appears somewhere incredible later) and added to a fun night. \n\nHighly recommend this place for a unique group event/dinner. I\'m definitely coming when my girlfriends make a trip here. I know they\'d appreciate the decor (over-the-top and dark). I\'d like to mention here that some girls at the group ordered cocktails that were apparently awful. The waiter did take the cocktails back. Maybe you might want to stick to wine with your meal.', 'This is my favorite Italian restaurant in Vegas. I am here a few times a year visiting family and whenever I am this is always on my list of places to go.  The staff has always been friendly  and the food has never disappointed me.  The bread is really good too!', 'I guess I need someone to tell me just what is good here food-wise (perhaps next time I should check out the Yelp reviews first). But the ambiance is totally awesome. So it evens out to 3 stars.\n\nI finally got around to eating here last weekend as part of my date night. We hadn\'t read anything about it and  thus  had no idea what to expect. As soon as we walked in  we were in love. This place perfectly represents that image of ""old Vegas"" I have in my head. It was outlandish while also warm and welcoming. I could just picture Liberace eating here. I could also imagine the Rat Pack  mobsters  etc. eating here as it just seemed so fitting of all of them.\n\nWe started off our dining experience with the calamari. Unfortunately  it wasn\'t even edible. We had little doubt that it came straight out of a box from the frozen food aisle. 1 star. For entrees  I opted for the cavatelli (it had an icon indicating it as one of their signature dishes) and my husband had the gnocchi. The menu described the cavatelli as ""sauteed"" and with meat sauce. What I was served was neither sauteed nor meat sauce. I almost asked if I was served the wrong thing  but since our server was the wife of the owner  I felt bad saying anything. The pasta was too mushy  the sauce wasn\'t very good at all  and I barely tasted any cheese. My date declared it inedible. I nibbled at it a bit  but refused a take home box. 1 star. My date\'s gnocchi was ok  but also not cooked properly. 2 stars. And 1 star too for the wine list.\n\nAt the end of our meal  our server explained the history of the restaurant and gave us the lay of the land so to speak. It was great to walk around and see all the different rooms (love the bar area!) and all of the pictures (especially the ghost pictures). The place itself is most definitely 5 stars. And that fact alone will bring us back here and have us recommending it to visitors.', 'We asked our hotel concierge for a restaurant recommendation.  She said there\'s a place off the strip where you can get excellent cheap Italian food.  She said  ""I\'m Italian"" and I love it and all my out of town guests always ask to go there.  So we said what the heck  beats paying a fortune for a mediocre meal at one of the big fancy hotel restaurants.  \n\nThe first note about Carluccio\'s is it is right next door to the Liberace Museum.  Las Vegas is such a bizarre place.  Any way  the interior is a flash back to to the 80\'s and still kind of charming in that bizarre Las Vegas sort of way.  It was also dark inside  which was a good thing  because they would get negative stars for the cleanliness factor.  Our bread basket and the inside of my menu had globs of marinara sauce on them.  Tasty....um  no....disgusting.\n\nThe bread was outstanding.  It was just bread  with no fancy dipping oil or vinegar. Just good solid bread with butter.  Side salad...blech.  Bottle of Pinot Grigio...yummy (friend pointed out it could be bought at Costco for half the price we paid).  Mushroom appetizer...good in concept...mushrooms in white wine sauce topped with cheese and baked.  Not so good in execution as the wine sauce was tangy and harsh.  Chicken parmigiana entree  pretty tasty.  It was served with a side of pasta with meat sauce containing very little meat to speak of.  I tried my friend;s gnocchi and it was doughy tasting (not in a good way)!  We skipped dessert.\n\nService was poor  but what do you expect when  you can get a bottle of wine  3 entrees  3 side salads and an appetizer for less than $80 (the wine was half the bill at $40).  \n\nThis place would be great for a group of people who want decent food for cheap.  Plus Liberace is next door.  That\'s a big draw right there!  Or not...', ""I have driven by  Carluccio's many times over the past 20 yrs and always wanted to try it but never got around to it. It always seemed to have an old school vibe which I like. Picked up my uncle for an early dinner and he suggested  Carluccio's  he said it was very good. Works for me. Really cool decor  very nice and attentive staff. I had the ceasar salad which was cold and dressed perfectly. I think the crutons may have been homemade. Moved onto the meat stuffed ravioli which was great. The portions are large as one expects at Italian and Mexican restaurants. Had to take half home and eat the next day. When you walk into the door  the smell of garlic hits you  which is a good sign! I thought it was priced right  $9 and up. I will be back!"", ""I didn't realize this place shutdown. I used to love this place  came here so many times when I lived in Vegas. It was really good Italian food  and pretty cheap compared to Sergio's Italian Gardens a few doors down. And I guess the whole Liberace museum is gone too  the last of Liberace Plaza."", ""Great prices  romantic ambience  delicious Italian basics!  \n\nIf you are looking for a tasty meal but don't want to spend a fortune (and it's very easy to do that in Vegas Strip restaurants!)  this is a great place just a few minutes East of the strip on Tropicana.  \n\nIt's very popular  and a lot of locals eat there (we saw cast members from one of the shows)  and the interior is whimsically designed by Liberace - mirrors  strings of white lights dangling from everything  Italian fountains.  The recorded music features showtunes and jazz standards sung by greats such as Frank Sinatra  Bobby Darin  and even Rod Stewart  but I believe they have live music as well (maybe during happy hour).  It's dark in the dining area  but the thousands of string lights and candles on the table create a nice romantic glow.  \n\nThe food was very yummy  and very inexpensive for how good it was.  I had the Cavatelli pasta (a curved tubular pasta  a little like Penne with a break in it) with Marinara and CLEANED my plate.  My husband had spaghetti with meat sauce and mushrooms  and he liked his a lot as well.  We shared fried calamari with marinara.  The pasta dishes were $9 each  and my husband took most of his home!  \n\nWe love Italian food  and for the price  this is one of the best in Vegas.  We barely spent $30 for the both of us  which is great because we went to an Italian restaurant in a hotel restaurant on the Strip  and spent $50 per person!!  I wish we had gone to Carluccio's for Valentine's Day  because the ambience is romantic yet fun.  It is nothing fancy  but they do basics very well.  I would like to go back to try their fish dishes (other entrees are priced between $12 and $20).  \n\nLike Italian food?  Then you MUST try Carluccio's!"", 'We had a 50 anniverasy here for my grandparents. They accomdated us very well. We had a private room with all our close family and friends. We were able to drop the  cake off early and they stored it for us. Wine was on the tables and food was delish. We had a couple options to choose from. It was perfect for my grandparents as they are fans when coming to Las Vegas from california!!', ""It's my family's favorite place.  They have been taking me there for years.  It's a pretty simple joint.  Not a big wine list.  Not pretentious.  Really fantastic red sauce.  I eat the Shrimp Fra Diavolo with the hot marinara.  The veal dishes are really good and what you would expect Italian to be.  Other places get fancy  Carluccio's gets it right.  Best of all they have been around for as long as I've been around.  Nothing has changed.  Every taste is like it was many many years ago."", 'I LOVE THIS PLACE.  The first time we ate there it was 21 years ago..I  go there for the chicken livers with a tarragon cream sauce served over a bed of linguine.  YUMMMY.  Hosted a dinner party two years in a row for 40 people and the bill was ...reasonable.... Fun place to go...not fancy ...dated...but the food is good!!  The lasagne was yummy too!...and hrmmm what else did I steal off someones plate...stuffed mushrooms..and hrmm scampi..  LIFE IS GOOD', 'Can\'t say much more than what everyone else has already said - as far as old school Vegas Italian food places go  this is my favorite spot in town.  How can you go wrong with good  solid food and a Liberace designed interior? \n\nCalories be damned this time I went for the Shrimp Alfredo - which was absolutely stellar.  Wide ribbon noodles in a decadent  thick alfredo sauce that was seriously one of the best I\'ve ever had.  The portions are HUGE - so I have left-overs for lunch today!  My husband had the Shrimp Oreganado which looked fabulous with a side of spaghetti - he liked it so much he polished it off.  He may as well have licked the plate. \n\nIf you go - don\'t forget to take a peek in the piano lounge (supposedly the most haunted room in Vegas according to the magician performing there).   A charming room with twinkle lights in the ceiling  a piano-shaped bar  classic white Eero Saarinen Tulip chairs  and a fabulous mirrored piano a la Liberace!  Thursday happy hour has live music too!  Prices are reasonable - our party of four got out for half of what we paid a month ago at Casa Di Amore down the street.\n\nCan\'t wait to go back - as Liberace\'s theme song would say....""I\'ll Be Seeing You""...definitely.', ""When I heard the Liberace Museum was shutting down  was wondering if they'd still be open.  I'm happy to report  they are.  And they remain one of my favorite places in Vegas and a tribute to red sauce.  The chicken parm was as good as ever and the service was excellent.  And you can't beat the interior design!  I love this place."", ""This is a wonderful  hidden treasure!  I've driven by there a thousand times and even went to the Liberace museum when it was still open.  However  I didn't think to try the restaurant until my mom bought a dining deal.  I went with my parents and had this old school  throw back Italian meal.  My mom had the lasagna  a la carte.  Huge piece came out!  I doubt you could eat much more than that portion.  She took half of it to go.  My dad ordered a shrimp and spinach dish (I can't remember the name of it).  I tried a couple bites and it was very good.  I had this shrimp and garlic dish (can't remember the specific name of it either) but it was very good.  In fact  I took a piece of bread and mopped up the rest of the sauce!  Every meal comes with a side of spaghetti and marinara.  I was too full to eat it but my dad said it was very good.  \n\nA couple weeks later  my husband and I went for their Thursday night happy hour.  It's so wonderful to go into the bar area.  If you like anything that sparkles  you'll love this place!  The bar is a white piano and sparkles from the ceiling to the floor!  They also have live music on Thursday nights.  Not sure if they have different acts  but the night we were there the people were very talented.\n\nMinimum  my husband and I will be back for their happy hour.  I'm sure we'll make it for dinner too!"", 'Comfortable & quiet.  I feel nurtured in this joint.  I eat in the bar so I can feel close to the piano (weird  I know).  I don\'t go for the food  but it is enjoyable.  The chicken marsala has an eclectic sweet taste which is refreshing.\n\nPS.  Don\'t call old Vegas tacky  it\'s Fabulous Las Vegas  not ""7 shades of Beige"" Las Vegas.\nRIP Liberace', ""The Olive Garden by any other name is still The Olive Garden.\n\nGo to Nora's on Flamingo....similar prices  radically better wine list and many many times better overall."", 'I\'ve been always wanting to try Carluccio\'s -- I\'m an often Vegas tourist who likes to explore nook-and-cranny museums  eateries et al (I know life is more than the Strip) -- I have the opportunity to finally get there over July 4th weekend.  All you need to know is that I did so in 111 degrees and via bus -- and it was oh so well worth it!\n\nFirst  the service and staff were wonderful -- I\'d been seated maybe 5 minutes and looking at the menu when another server (or manager) insisted on making sure I got some water because I looked like I\'d ""been out in the sun.""  For an older restaurant  the service was anything but attitudewise -- very enthusiastic  friendly  knowledgeable...very homey.\n\nFoodwise  wow  for the choices and taste and also for the reasonable prices.  I had the stuffed shrimp  which came witha side of pasta (I wanted to try the sauce  plus I ordered a side of meatballs) along with a  casesars salad.  For dessert I had to try -- or shall I say  ingest -- a homemade cannoli.   All food items were exceptionally tasteful  authentic  unique  flavorful...and the homemade bread was yummy as well.  Plus I did check out the lounge area for all the celb pics and piano bar and all the historical things (thanks to other reviewers for suggesting).\n\nJust an all-around great dinning experience after a scorching hot day of playing tourist.  Totally hit the spot.\n\nPS  As i understand it  the Trop location is closing (Liberace closing wasnt good with the restaurant tucked back in the shopping center) and a smaller version will be opening in Henderson.  If I get to Henderson ona future trip you can be sure I will be there for dinner!', ""Be forewarned: they are very heavy in their sauces  and you can order light sauce. This would have been helpful to us if we had known before hand. \n\nWith that being said  this place was a disappointment.  It's Italian food with upscale pricing  but low scale food quality. I've never been to an Italian restaurant where they serve prepackaged butter with their bread sticks. The food was covered in their sauce  and it looks like you received a bowl of sauce. They do serve a lot of food  and we were like every table there: taking food home in a container. \n\nThe ambiance was very dark and loud. Dress ranged from formal to tshirt casual. The staff was very friendly  though. \n\nIn the end  I don't think I'd make another visit here on my next Vegas trip."", ""Sometimes when I go to an older place like this I have to decide if it is a run down dump or if it authentic and charming.  Carluccio's has the old school charm!\n\nThe place is by the now derelict Liberace Museum on east Tropicana.  I am guessing it has been here for 20-30 years which is a long time by Vegas standards  so it has some history.  The place has brick walls  old school burgandy colored booths  custom wood door  dark wood in the bar area and I loved the black and red tiles in the bathroom.  \n\nIt has a bar area  restaurant area and we sat in the atrium area at a table.  The hostess and waitress were very friendly.  \n\nThe menu was typical of a Italian joint.  The prices seemed reasonable.  I ordered the meatballs and sausage plate.  It was a large offering with a side of pasta.  Very tasty - the meat sauce was right on!  I tried a friends chicken parm - that was tasty.  Huge servings at reasonable prices!  \n\nCarlucio's is so not corporate and that's why I really like it!"", 'OMG I cant say enough about this place. Was in town heard about this place so we decided to try it out. We heard about if from the man who does the Vegas ghost tours. There was nine of us and we ALL LOVED the place. We LOVED it soooo much we went back the next night ;-)  John the owner was so nice he told of all about the ghost stories. John and his staff are so nice. They have a magican that comes around the table. He was really good - sorry cant remember your name ;-(  The food was so good and they give you so much. The pasta primavera was the best I ever had. The bartender is the best. I will be back everytime I go to Vegas. If i could give it more stars I would. John - your crew and you are FANTASTIC keep up the good work.', 'Best service I have had in a long time.  He cared and made sure everyone was having a good time and meant it......Food was excellent for the price ($9-12 for all meals) and the place is all lit up.....You need to go here if you want to get off the strip.....It is a good experience inside as well as outside with the neon piano', 'A late sixties year old woman struggled to light a cigarette sitting on a bench below the Carluccio\'s Tivoli Gardens neon sign high above her.  ""I hate having to come out side to smoke "" she mumbled pulling her light sweater over her shoulders.   Our party bus pulled into the parking lot and drove past the Liberace Museum and neon grand piano and stopped in front of the smoking Carluccio\'s regular.  We all streamed out of the bus as she reviewed and evaluated each one of us. ""I bet most of these kids don\'t even know who Liberace was "" she mused.  I opened the wood carved door to the Liberace design restaurant and the team entered into a world hip and cool 35 years ago that is now hip and cheeky in 2007.\n\nI travel to Las Vegas at least two times a year for various trade shows for eBay or for various social events.  Like many of my friends  I get tired of the big casino hotspots that we all read about in the hotel room ""Las Vegas"" magazines.   Thankfully  my friend Jennifer found Carluccio\'s through her parents that live in the area and decided to host our team party there.  Carluccio\'s was probably THE place to be for Las Vegas hip in the 70s and is now a refreshing escape for those of us looking for something different...yet sill Las Vegas.\n\nApparently Carluccio\'s was designed by Liberace and it shows. Each room is a different style from a dark lounge with vinyl booths to an Italian sculpture garden to the all-mirrored back room replete with a bar shaped like a piano and twinkling lights on the ceiling.  Our group from eBay found our way to the mirrored back room where we enjoyed hearty Italian food. Bottles of Chianti housed in the traditional whicker baskets greeted us and were free flowing  accompanied by mozzarella and tomato and fried calamari hors d\'oeuvres.  Due to our group (21) size  Carlucci\'s served a fixed menu including veal parmesan  chicken picatta and Lasagna.  The food was great for the basic Italian fare and the portions are HUGE.  Most of the group only ate half of what was served.  I\'d recommend even ordering one entre and splitting it. I had the veal which was a little tough and smothered in sauce and cheese.  That should tell connoisseurs of Italian food that it\'s not top-line quality.  However   Henry had the chicken parmesan which he said was good and Beth had the lasagna which she seemed to enjoy.\n\nWe were entertained by a great piano bar duet  Gus and Kathy.  Gus is a stage name for C.J. who is a full time plumber in Las Vegas.  Kathy is a long time friend of 30 years who sings with Gus in his ""Off-The Strip"" appearances. Gus  with is long gray pony tail and grey bushy mustache tickled out basic Sinatra tunes and 70s hits like ""Easy Like Sunday Morning."" Kathy chimed-in with ""do-waps"" and chorus versus when appropriate.  My friend Beth requested for me ""Staying Alive"" by the Bee Gees  hoping to elicit a performance reminiscent of Marty and Elaine from ""Swingers.""  However  Gus did not have that song on his laptop that sat on top of his piano serving as his sheet music. Beth was able to get ""More Than A Woman"" played for those of us with a Barry Gibb craving.\n\nAfter Gus and Kathy\'s final number  we cleared out of the back room shaking hands with the musical duo and thanking Carlucci\'s manager for a great experience.  Overall  the food was good...not great.  However  the AMBIANCE and the old-school Las Vegas experience is OFF THE CHARTS.  I HIGHLY recommend taking the $10 cab ride off the strip to experience this restaurant.  I get the feeling most frequent Vegas travelers are not aware of this hidden vinyl and polyester gem.', 'This was one of the most wonderful places to go to!\nEspecially for birthdays!\nEverything tasted like wine  the food was beyond great.\nThe stuffed mushrooms ruled the earth!\nThe seafood diablo was the shit!!\nThe chocolate mouse tasted like a shot of booze!\n\nI loved the atmosphere and the classiness. The twinkly white lights  it was so Liberace chic. \nEvery room was beautiful  and so was the bar. This was one of the last great las Vegas gems to fade out.\n\nEvery time I drive by I get sad.\nI was 16 when i had my ""nice"" birthday dinner there. \nI wish this place would just come back!!!!!', ""Carluccio's is the king of Italian restaurants in Vegas. For the price  for quality and quantity it doesn't get any better. Service is great and the location is right off the strip. All you new comers and old timers in town need to make this your Italian go to."", 'This is my favorite Italian place in Vegas. It has great local history  being that as Tivoli Garden it was owned by the one and only Liberace! It has one of his pianos in the back seating area and the back bar is grand piano shaped. The food is really  really good and the atmosphere hearkens back to the good old days of Vegas when the Rat Pack and the Mob were headliners. I have gone here for the 13 years I have lived her and consider it a must show to visitors who think the Strip is Vegas. We know better...THIS is Vegas  BABY!', ""If you want great Italian food that will not break the bank? This is the place to go. This place has been there since the early 1980's and you can tell by the decor. They have their fair share of loyal customers including myself. \n\nThe food there is awesome! The seafood diablo is a must have  so is the orange roughy in white sauce. If you like shrimp  the crab stuffed shrimp is great as an appetizer or as an entree. The zuppa the clams is also a great appetizer. \n\nI know service is a hit or miss. This is the same with all restaurants. However  I still give it 5 stars for great food that is not over priced. No one can beat this place."", ""This restaurant just moved to Silverado Ranch Blvd.  and Eastern Avenue. The address is 9821 South Eastern Ave. Why would I tell you that... because without a doubt this is my favorite Italian Restaurant. The sauces are all authentic and old school Italian. \nI have tried so many items lasagna  raviolis cheese and meat  Zuppa de Clams on and on. I have never been disappointed with anything I have ordered. The homemade bread is amazing. My husband loves the chicken parmigiana and it is the most tender chicken I have ever tasted. You can tell they tenderize it properly in the kitchen.\nThis restaurant has an incredible staff everyone is wonderful. The food  the staff make it worth the drive. \nSo look for the Doc Holliday's behind Freed's Bakery and you will find the new location for the best Italian restaurant in Las Vegas.  I just wish I could get the recipe for the sauce....absolutely perfect!!! \nThe desserts are excellent too. If I have an opportunity to go out to dinner this is where I go. See you there!"", ""I've been to Carluccio's several times  the last being on January 24  2011.  Unlike prior experiences  I was less than satisfied.  The Casaer Salads were watery and when complained and asked that they be replaced we got more of the same.  I had Spaghetti & meatballs as my entree.  The meatballs and sauce were bland and there was probably a quarter of a cup of pasta water in my plate.  I didn't bother complaining.  I think they lost a customer."", ""Being a 2nd generation Sicilian and growing up eating true homade italian cuisine you can expect me to be extremely picky when it comes to italian food.  One of the great things I love about vegas is  if good dego eats is what you crave  chances are you've got a top notch joint with in 5 minutes away from you at any given time  and carluccios is one of the best.  For an old school vegas feel  great service and phenominal food look no further.  Whenever I go I get linguini with muscles  clams  shrimp and calamari.  I can't tell you the exact name of the dish  but it comes in red spicy arabiata style sauce and it is to die for.  \n\nWith its central location just minutes from the strip this place is perfect for locals and tourist a like.  If your visiting  do yourself a favor  forget about the overpriced strip hotel restraunts. And pay carluccios a visit you won't be disapointed."", 'Great ambiance!  Real old school Vegas feel to it.  Food was good but not great.  The chicken marsala had a different taste to the sauce.  A bit of a mapley flavor to it.  Portions are not very big.  Still  its a decent place to eat for Italian and I will be back.', ""alright  so...here's the deal... if you're looking for something a bit different experience wise  that's not super vegas strip typical fare  this is definitely the place to visit. the experience? a visual buffet. the food? average.\n\nthe food is moderately good. i've had way worse  but it's not amazing. the red sauce is somewhat bland and slightly tangy  which is definitely not my style.\n\nthe portion size was huge. we had the veal florentine and chicken parmesan. the veal was so super tender and moist. the chicken was alright. \n\nwas it worth it just for the strange Liberace ambiance and casual no frills attitude? absolutely. it looks like this was the place where all the mobsters would eat. flashing bulbs on the ceilings and brown brick walls with yellow windows. everyone in the place was having a great time  laughing it up  getting loud and boisterous  which is a good sign.\n\ni admit it  the next morning i wished i hadn't wasted a vegas meal on this place  but i'll surely never forget it. i think the lights have been burned into my memory forever."", ""Service kinda sucked  so did the food. It's a meal though  and if someone else is paying  why complain? I wouldn't go there again though."", 'I can\'t enough about this place as where to go to show out of town guests a piece of classic Las Vegas. \n\nAnyplace named ""I Lov it"" spelled backward by Liberace is worth a try especially if you remember his shows. \n\nWe went as a group and sat in the piano bar room. The owner was happy to show us all of the great Liberace memorabilia and where when the place was owned by Liberace he liked to sit. \n\nOur food was fantastic! I had the chicken livers tarragon. This was the recommendation of our server for something unique from their menu. It was fantastic tremendously filling with lots of garlic  butter  good wine  and perfectly prepared tender livers. If you are a fan of liver (I know it is not everyone\'s favorite) this is the meal for you. \n\nKelly our bartender knows all of the classic cocktails and talked us into trying an Italian margarita. She also can make the champagne drinks Liberace loved so much. This is a great place for a good classic cocktail. \n\nThe restaurant is not your typical pub for Las Vegas. No video poker machines  no blaring televisions  you go here and talk to the rest of your party. Compared to the strip food the portions are generous and reasonably priced. \n\nFamilies are welcome and seated in a separate section of the restaurant for a traditional family dinner. Then we saw some secret booths at the front which reminded us of down-low mob meeting places where nobody is going to see you spill the goods to the feds. \n\nAn evening at Carluccios makes me rejoice in that for once Las Vegas has embraced its\' history and the owners of this place have decided to keep kitsch alive!']"

Thomas was so pleasant and helpful as we were greeted and given front side stage seating VIP TREATMENT! The men were respectful and very tasteful  giving all the ladies attention as if they were the only one in the room. I was given two stage performances  one by ""Ready""  and boy was he READY! so was I lol  the other gentleman ""Speedy"" I guess was funny as hell. I recommend this place if you wanna have fun that never ends........ladies bring your wallet thing\'s can add up. Is it worth it ? Hell yea! Beware of Dave the MEANIE he\'s a driver for the mansion  he will pick you up   and drop you off back to your hotel if the PRICE is right! Otherwise your stuck at the mansion  he will politely text you and say ""you didn\'t tip so no ride home! plus I\'m off"". I simply laughed   I\'m from Oakland BABY  I can get down. lol staff handle the situation well providing drinks to me and my girls as they hooked up a ride for us. Would I return yes . Thanks for a wonderful night fellas. I do apologize for this late review .                                                           \n\n\n\n                                                                                        Tameikia', ""I planned a bachelorette party for my friend and there were 6 of us. At first  we chose the $25 pp package with limo pickup  admission and 2 drinks until I read in fine print does not include limo ride back to hotel. So then we went with the package of $45 pp to include limo pickup and drop off  VIP entrance  reserved seating  and 2 drinks. All along they tell you please do not be late for limo pickup so I made sure we were on time  however the limo was about 40 min late and not only that they show up in a shuttle bus!! Not cool! And there was another group of girls with us which was ok but not what we paid for. The driver did apologize and said there would be a limo to take us back. Then we pull up to Hustler club. No where in the info I looked up said it was at the hustler. Again no big deal but would've been nice to know that's where it was at. No VIP entrance needed cause there was no line and go in and no reserved seated needed cause it was almost empty. And it said on all info packed sat nights get there early. Seated limited! Ok so the male strippers were good with the girls and bride to be  however their bodies were all so stubly or prickly as though the hadn't been freshly waXed or shaved. A big turn off! Never the less we had a good time. I just wish it was a little more organized! Ands since we paid that much money and then had to pay another $60 to get bride onstage was a little much."", 'I came here for my 40th .First of they offer free limo service to and from which was really cool.  When we first arrived we were greeted by the manager he walked us up to the top floor where the male review was and told us we had the choice of seats wherever we wanted.  We were also given two drink coupons per person so we ordered a drink and got seated. The show started off slowly but what I really liked is the guys came out to sit and talk to you  also they were really cool about taking pictures. By the end of the night it was so crowded but it was amazing had the best time I definitely will be back. I hope soon.', ""I love this Place !!! Every time I'm in Vegas I stop by and have some fun at this place . I go to see Convict and the Cowboy !! Great place"", 'This place is great! And our waitress Jakki was awesome. Forget Chippendales etc.  This is the place to go!', ""Looks nice on the outside and on the pics but I was really disappointed.  I met by best friend in Vegas for a girl's weekend. The limo for Hunk Mansion was scheduled to pic us up and never showed...after multiple phone calls and confusion between drivers as to who was coming to pick ua b up and then one getting into an acciddent...it ended up being to close to closing to even go...so we booked to go the second night. They actually did pick us up in what was supposed to be a party bus for two of us I guess but looked like an airport shuttle with hunk mansion. Written on the side.  \nWe got to the club and I was getting hopeful..u was nuce..music was good..and we were told where to go for the men and immediately lost hope. No one greeted us...it was small...pretty empty..no energy...we picked a table..the guys were pretty hot but there were only 4. We sat waiting for a server and realized you go to the bar and get your own drinks..which I did and they were pretty bad. Finally one dancer came over to talk to us..he was very hot..explained how things worked...thought things were going to get better...then all the dancers disappeared for a stage show for the  Bachelorette dance..which was pretty bad...we called..OG'S and left...didn't even finish our crappy drinks. All the bells but no whistles...very disappointed."", ""Magic Mike  eat your heart out. These boys can dance!!!  Take your bachelorettes here  ladies. They'll hate you for a minute  but love you for the rest of their lives."", ""My friend and I made reservations online for $30 each which would get us a limo pick up  admission  and two drinks. We were told to be downstairs at a certain area at 9:15. Our limo driver John was 10-15 minutes late and then he couldn't find us. I kept telling him where we were and he told us to go an opposite way. All he had to tell us was that he was across the street from us. Instead we walked down the street the wrong way and he flipped a u-turn to get us. When we got to the club with the other girls in the limo they told us he was already in a bad mood before he got us. When we go to pay the cashier told my friend and I $40 each. I argued saying we reserved for $30 but she said our ticket says $40. She told us we'd get a ride back so we obliged. The moment we sit down at a table 5 different guys were on us asking if we wanted a dance. My friend pointed at me and I guess he whispered to her it was $25. We said nevermind. We had JUST sat down and wanted to warm up and get the feel of the place  these guys were pushy. All of us at the table agreed we were thinking there'd be a stage show and then mingling time. Instead there was a few short stage shows and the guys were doing lap dances at the same time as the show. You'd think they'd give eachother enough respect to not do lap dances during the show since the guy on stage could make more money if everyone was paying attention to him. We spent a few hours here and we were told to call our limo driver for the return ride. I called and texted him. Waited 45 minutes without a response. When I asked one of the girls at the main entrance downstairs for help she said there was nothing they could do since it was another company (in a mean tone and practically rolling her eyes. This makes me think it happens more times then not.) We ubered out of there instead. This experience was supposed to be fun and exciting but instead it felt like a rip off and the customer service was AWFUL and NONEXISTENT. Only help I had was from Thomas who offered us another night with some shots but honestly we never want to go back. I asked for the difference we were forced to pay without getting a ride back and I got that within a few days."", 'Honestly I have never posted a review on yelp and I\'m pretty wary of bad reviews.  But I encourage you to never visit hunk mansion. I did a lot of research for this place and every promise was broken.  I got the set of tickets that includes a ""reserved"" table but once we got there pretty much all the tables were taken and we had a party of 5 which is hard to accommodate. When we got there we asked where we would sit and the lady at the front said that we could sit anywhere. I specifically asked if we could sit at tables with reserved signs and she said yes. But we sat at a table with a reserved sign and the manager said we\'d have to buy a $350 bottle to sit there. We went to the first lady to say she told us it was ok to sit there and she ended up saying we had to speak to the manager. He ended up telling us we could have the seats and a bottle for a ""generous discount"" of $150. We declined and he said he was overbooked and there was nothing he could do about it. We obviously argued that we paid for the reserved table and he would not budge. We ended up waiting and finding a table. Then even though we were upset and tried to make the best of it we were told as part of our ticket price we\'d get 2 free drinks. When we tried to get our second drink we were told that we couldn\'t redeem our drink tickets after an hour even though literally no one said that and the website didn\'t say it either. Honestly it was my birthday and I wanted to have fun but it pretty much ruined my experience. NEVER come to hunk mansion. They just lied and treat you like crap when you try to get what was promised to you.', ""Such an amazing place!!! We came here with a group of 11 girls for my friends 30th and it was everything we could of hoped for and more!! Such a fun experience  the guys were very nice and very very built! Loved watching the guys and their routines  I can't say enough good things about Hunk Mansion!!! We seriously had the best time and I will for sure be coming back!!!!"", 'Perfect place for a bachelorette party. Everyone had a great time. Excellent service from the VIP host  bartender  and cocktail waitress Jakki. The dancers are amazing.', ""So much fun! It was my friend's birthday. She'd not been with a man in quite some time  and she was a self-described prude; I needed an environment where she could cut loose and have fun but feel safe and comfortable. I'd spoken with the manager ahead of time  and he'd been exceptionally honest in saying that he couldn't promise me the best seats  etc. He could have just taken my money  but he didn't  and I really appreciated his honesty. (There's a story about a different group who were totally skeevy.) He said instead that we were most likely to get great seats if we arrived earlier in the evening  rather than later. The two of us were picked up by free limo in exchange for having to buy two drinks each. That's fair  especially as it was only $50 total for all four drinks. We got there early  and the women around us were still too sober. We brought our own fun to counteract the grumpy grumpsters behind us. That was around 8:30 pm  I think. But the men were already dancing  and they were all just gorgeous  gorgeous men. Those fabulous dancers were immediately attentive and charming. And soon  the place was hopping. We enjoyed a number of very attentive dances without having to share until the place got packed around 12:30 AM. When we left  it was full of crazy women having an awesome and amazing time. (I guess the key is to make sure your bachelorette or birthday group isn't full of pissy women  and come prepared with a good attitude.) \n\nAs to how Hunk Mansion compares to others  my previous experience with strippers involved a couple of local shows at home  Men of X (MOX)  Thunder from Down Under (TFDU)  and Olympic Gardens (OG). MOX and TFDU are just male revues in which you sit amongst way way way too many women and have no real interaction with the guys. At TFDU  for example  a bride seated in the middle of our overpacked table kept walking into the aisles and *trying* so hard to have interactions with guys. While very inexpensive  those shows are so impersonal and lame as to be a waste of time. And forget getting drinks at the overpacked bars of the male revues! Hunk Mansion is SO much better than those places! The men at HM were all over us  and my friend got all of the attention she could possibly want. It was easy enough to get drinks at the bar  and the bartender was such a sweetheart and outrageous flirt. Any woman would feel honored by the attention. It was nice that not only did my friend whose birthday we were celebrating get some affection  but so did I as her buddy. \n\nAs to how it compares to OG  Hunk Mansion is way better. I swear that most of the men at OG the last time that I was there were on drugs  were not very good dancers  and only one guy had seemed to actually have any interest in being sensual with women. Whereas at Hunk Mansion  the men love women. (Holy moly! Hector is insanely sensual. That guy looooooves women! Seriously  get a dance or five from Hector.) They're also more athletic and better dancers. I felt like OG was totally lame  and I wondered why women got shafted (excuse the pun) at strip clubs. Why do the men only get high quality and beautiful dancers? Whereas at Hunk Mansion  it's what a woman would hope to experience at a strip club. \n\nI also liked that the men at Hunk Mansion were upfront with prices and expectations  so you knew exactly what you'd get  and it was a very fair transaction. Much as in real relationships  it's always better when there's honesty involved."", ""I have never been to a strip club before  and I am so glad this was my first experience! I am hooked! The guys here are SO nice and SO. FCKN. HOTTTT. It's been a week since I went and I'm still daydreaming about that night  it was AMAZING. It is definitely entertaining and the guys put on a really good show. If you are in vegas for some fun  you definitely have to stop by at least one of your nights. It is so worth it! Trust me! The guys will not disappoint. We're already planning our next visit. :p"", 'I love this place! I will be back everytime I come to Vegas. My friend and I had so much fun. The guys are super hot! Not to sure about ""Ted""  but whatever floats your boat  they have it . Hahaha. The $30 cover charge is a great deal for a limo ride to and from your hotel and 2 drinks. I would\'ve spent more than that on just a cab. I liked that it wasn\'t too crowded and we were able to find a table  and this was a Saturday night.  Waiting in line outside kind of sucked  but it went quick. My only regret is that I was so nervous  this being my first time at a male strip club  that I drank too much too quick and we had to leave earlier than my friend would\'ve liked. I can\'t wait to go back  I\'ve told all my friends about it and we\'ll have a much bigger group next time.', 'Worst male review EVER!!! Stay clear ladies unless you like watching little boys walk around in their tennis shoes. A complete joke and total let down... only two dancers that even looked like gown men and the female manager was as rude as they come. Not worth the cost or your time.', ""This was definitely the HIGHLIGHT of my bachelorette weekend. I had been to a small male strip club many years ago in LA and I remember it being just ridiculous and thinking man  this doesn't even turn me on (unlike when guys go to strip clubs and totally get turned on by female strippers). I thought this experience was going to be the same  but I was wrong! The strippers are pretty hot (ahem  pitbull and mojito!)  and I actually got turned on by one of them during my lap dance because he was THAT good. My gfs and I said we were just going to be there for an hour or so at max so we could go clubbing on the strip afterward  but we ended up staying here longer because we all couldn't get enough of the men and craziness  plus we all wanted lap dances!!! I now know why guys can spend hours and a ton of money at strip clubs haha. My gfs and I still reminisce about hunk mansion weeks later  talking about how it was the best life decision we made that weekend. If you're deciding between this and a thunder down under type of show  I would go with this all the way. This is way better  way more interaction  and overall guaranteed wild and fun time. Thank you for the best weekend ever!"", ""My friend and I went here for my birthday weekend a week ago today and boy let me tell you these men know what they're doing  very sexy!!.we will definitely return...its going to be our tradition every time we're in Vegas  which is quite a few times a year  thank you hunk mansion to the best birthday a girl can ask for..see you soon"", ""They have great online deals for special events and occasions. We got picked up and dropped off like queens  with great service frm beginning to end. Definitely will be booking more events at this place. Come with extra cash ladies  it's worth every penny!"", ""There's a little something for everyone here. A guy of every type for every type of lady. Came here for a bachelorette and they did treat our party like queens. Lots to see and do. We're having an absolute ball. Yes it's just as risqué as you think so don't bring your prudish friend  cuz she'll be upset. Come with a GREAT attitude and you will have a GREAT time."", 'This place is AMAZING. Great place for a bachlorett party!  Arrow and Pittbull are great. We had a BLAST', 'Literally just left Hunk Mansion at Larry Flynt\'s Hustler Club. I\'m celebrating my 52nd birthday and I wanted to party  so we paid $45 for the VIP package which included two drinks and RT limo service. Our previous experience had been to see the Men of Sapphire. We immediately liked The Mansion better. The limo driver was personable  the hostess Karen was a sweetheart  giving us two seats in the first row  center stage. The dancers were charming and very sexy  even those who weren\'t my particular type. (I\'m a sister  I like thick thighs and a nice butt.)  It was Sunday  not crowded (but a fun crowd)  so we got a fair deal of personal attention. Based on these things I\'d give the Mansion five stars. The one star rating I\'m actually giving is because of the abysmal customer service we received from security and management. I gave my niece $20 to buy a drink; when she handed me the change I noticed that a third of the $5 bill she gave me was missing. The drama began when she tried to exchange/return it for one that wasn\'t mutilated. We were first told that the $5 bill was real (this was never in question). We were then asked if we planned to buy something else  as if that would impact our getting a $5 bill that was not practically torn in half. Finally  we were told that we would need to wait for security to review the tape to verify that the bartender gave us the bill  and that this would not happen until the club closed. (Of course this was a ruse to try to frustrate us into saying ""forget it"". As Hakeem says in the Geico ads ""not today""  and I said no problem.) We didn\'t have to wait  but after they reviewed the security tape we were told that when my niece accepted the change  the responsibility was hers (whatever the fcuk that means). Really!!!? As Judge Judy would say  that\'s a whole lot of ""who shot John"" (i.e. nonsense) over $5. I\'m in Vegas at least three times a year (always for my birthday)  and usually with some girlfriends. I\'m not a gambler  so I\'m always looking for entertainment. The Mansion went from a ""must"" to a ""bust"" in the span of about three hours. The poor customer care was unbelievable. Oh well  c\'est la vie!', 'We went to Hunk Mansion for our best friend\'s bachelorette party on a Saturday night  and I\'m so happy we did. We had a wonderful time  and the dancers  servers  front staff  and London Steele were really sweet to us group of girls from Canada. Our bride to be was smiling and laughing so hard her cheeks were aching after spending several hours at Hunk Mansion. \nAlso  like the previous poster mentioned  Kobe/ Colby? (he was making a movement of playing basketball so I\'m guessing ""Kobe"" spelling hehe) was really entertaining and super cute!!! I think he was European-Asian mix (so hot) and our group thought he was the friendliest one! He even hugged us all bye when we were about to jump into the elevator. Props to him for making our group feel special! Also  there\'s a nice diversity to the men dancing; so you\'ll definitely find your favourite male dancer. The men were all amazingly talented  any man can bump hard and grind slow... but actually having some dance skills is a bonus in my opinion. \n\nLastly  I would say for Canadian girls looking for a safe  clean  and exciting place to spend their bachelorette... this is the place to be. We spent $50  USD each and received a round trip limo ride from our hotel  and 2 free drinks each! The tables weren\'t ""reserved""  but it was easy enough to get a bunch of tables beside the stage (and there was 9 of us).\n\nSide note: the host ""London Steele"" is the man who inspired ""Dallas"" from Magic Mike the movie with Channing Tatum!! He was so nice to our group! Ohhh and don\'t take photos or else the DJ will call you out and boot you out of the mansion.', '...NOT GAY FRIENDLY...\n\nWe wanted to surprise one of my girlfriends for her b day. as soon as we go there they notice ""us"" guys and would not approach my best friend maria. When asked if my best friend can get a lap dance they responded saying they would give her a lap dance as long as my best friend or myself weren\'t asking for one.\n\ndiscrimination at its finest. I even had my ""Straight"" good friend defend us by saying that even if we did want a lap dance what would be so awful about it...\n\n trust me if it were up to me I would be spending my money somewhere else  but given the fact that I was trying to do something thoughtful for my girlfriend I was stuck on this one or just wait until we got back to Hollywood from our trip. SMH', ""Great experience!  The dancers are hot hot hot!  They are also friendly and they don't seem thirsty like the men at other clubs. They give a good show and they also work the crowd. I will definitely be back!"", 'I booked my sisters bachelorette here and it was amazing the bus picked us from the hotel to the venue and then drove us back  strippers are very good looking and super nice  and trust me they know how to dance. I thought the personal lap dances were to expensive tho $25 for me is too much. Drinks are a little over price as well but other than that the service was amazing and fun .', ""Lame is all I have to say. Went on a friday night and Only 5 dancers. The lap dances suck the men are more about showing you tricks and dance moves than grinding against you. Don't waste your cash here at all. There is a reason why after all these years this place doesn't have many reviews. The only plus about this place is the guys are nice to talk too. As for looks  most are skinny  not many are muscular  and a few seemed possibly gay."", 'Went on a Sunday  unlimited top shelf liquor. And it was really top shelf. Men are super handsome. And great service.  Will definitely return again.', 'Came to this place and I have no idea what everyone else is thinking with any review worth more than 1 star  except they MUST be crazy.  Please reconsider going here!  I\'m serious!  I\'m from Miami and we went to Vegas for a bachelorette.  I\'ve been to Vegas plenty of times but never done a strip club.  We went on a Thursday and arrived close to 10 p.m.  The place was pretty much dead.  There might have been 6 other women there.  The lights weren\'t really dimmed and the DJ was just plain bad.  Paying $30 regardless of how they want to market it by including ""free"" things is terrible.  I wouldn\'t have paid $5 for this place.  The guys come up to you and talk but they don\'t really do anything sexy to make you want to get a lap dance or pay for anything.  Normally  strip clubs have male dancers.  This is what a strip club does...they get guys that are hot to dance and then women want to give them their money.  It\'s a simple rule to follow.  We stayed for 20 minutes before we decided to make a run for the elevator.  Extremely disappointed and dissatisfied.  Don\'t make the same mistake we did by letting the other reviews influence you into going.  They must have never seen a man before or know what a strip club is.  TERRIBLE!', 'I\'ve never been to a place like this and I didn\'t know what to expect. Hunk Mansion felt like a speakeasy  with a hidden room and entrance inside the much large Hustler Club. We were given directions by one of the cashiers on how to find it... ""go down the long dark hallway and make a right by the 6\' Golden Boner and then make a left by beaver bucks  then walk to the end"" of yet another hallway. It was one of those times I asked myself... did she say what I thought she said?  At this point I had no idea what to expect but we were on a mission to have the best bachelorette party we can. \n\nThe staff was friendly and the dancers were very professional. We felt safe here as it was well lit and we could see everything that was going on.  It was a Saturday night and the energy was high. Our host was Thomas and he kept coming back to check on us to make sure we were having fun  and we most certainly did!', ""These guys are great  they know how to make the women happy. I recommend that you send your wife or girlfriend there to cut loose and have some fun. Management here is really nice and service is great. Lady's in Vegas are in for a treat."", 'Amazing time.. 19 girls for a bachelorette not a glitch organized!! All staff is great!!', ""The dancers were extremely hot and the majority of them were so nice. The problem we had was when we asked if my gay best friend could get a lap dance for his 21st birthday a lot of the dancers said they don't allow that there. Some finally told us that the owner only allows them in secret rooms and it's $150 for 15min instead of the normal 20/25$. That is complete discrimination and shameful on the owner. We finally went to the girl section so he could at least get some kind of lap dance and girl on girl or lesbian action was allowed downstairs. The discrimination there is just terrible and although we made friends with the strippers  will never return."", ""Ladies  skip the impersonal big name male revues and head to Hunk Mansion for your night out!  They have someone for everyone  whatever your flava man  you'll find it there. Every guy  starting with the host  Thomas  the DJ  the bartender  and all the dancers  is there to make sure you have the time of your life  and they deliver the fun in spades. You'll get everything you want in a night out: drinks  dancing and attention - without the ridiculous hassle of your typical dance club."", 'This place is amazing!  Great place for a  party!  The dancers are great and fun to PLAY with!  Defiantly recommend this place for a bride to be!', ""This was the first male strip club I've been to and I was pretty disappointed. There were about 5 dancers and only one guy was good looking (IMO  see picture). He was also the only good dancer so they definitely saved the best for last. The first dancer from Cali was extremely awkward to watch  he must be new.\n\nI expected it to be much more fun and wild for a bachelorette party but it was pretty chill. There weren't very many people there for a Thursday night either."", 'First off  our host Thomas was awesome.   Kept in contact with me the day off  confirmed our pick up time etc.  When I called our driver for a ride home he said he may or may not be available in 30 minutes.  Thomas got us a ride straight away!   So thank you!    \n \nWe came here with 11 girls for my sister\'s bachelorette party on a Saturday night.  We booked the party package that included an onstage with the bride and entry.  It\'s an additional 30 dollars per girl for 2 drink tickets.  I think a pretty good ""bang"" for your buck  lol.   It is a must to get on that giant golden penis and have a photo.  That thing is hilarious!   \n\nFor some reason every host we had for different events didn\'t recommend this place.  They all were recommending Men of Sapphire or Chippendales.  Since I went to Men of Sapphire for my bachelorette party years ago I wanted something different for my sister.   This is completely a different experience and a more one of one than Men of Sapphire.  Men of Sapphire have more of a stage and you sit afar and watch more of a show. Hunk Mansion the stage is super close and the men use the poles and engage more with the audience.    If you want a crazier night then do Hunk Mansion.   Plus  I found the men a lot sexier at Hunk Mansion than Men of Sapphire.   \n\nThe guys were all superhot; expect the little annoying Guido guy he was our least favorite.   However  all the guys even little Guido had awesome pole skills and every guy was very engaging to all the females.     If you do the package you can pick the guy you want on stage.  So beware  you will be bombarded when you first get there.  So just like Larry H Parker  they will all fight for you ;) I asked the bride to be whom she wanted.   So I recommend the same to other bride to bes.  Oh and seriously girls  if you want your crotch displayed than where a dress.  If not  I recommend wearing jeans.   \n\nThe pick-up and drop off:  \nWe were picked up on time but the bus that took us was super old  air continuing sucked and the speakers were blown in the back.  The ride home was a lot nicer; the party bus was awesome  working air  light show.  I would definitely retire the one that picked us up  especially in Vegas heat we were all sweating in that bus.\n\nThey have hookah at an additional price.  I thought a pretty cool option.   \n\nThe only dislike of the entire night is when I just got a beer and they let the ladies dance on the stage.  Some chick hit my beer with her shoe and spilled it on the ground and everyone saw even the bartender.  Luckily it didn\'t hit me or my friends.  It\'s $15 bucks for a beer since I used a drink ticket.  So logically since I didn\'t dump it and it was their fault they should replace it.  Different story if I spilled the drink I would of just bought another and owned up to it.  But it was obvious they knew the girl did it.  The bartender gave me total attitude but did give me a replacement  but he definitely didn\'t want to.  He said  oh any other place wouldn\'t do it. I was quite pissed  for a 50 cent beer I got such attitude.  Not from Stixxxs but the other one.   Stixxxs was super cool  lite your cigarette for you  made some pretty awesome shots. It\'s the little things that girls remember and such a small gesture would of gone miles.   But he decided to be a dick about it.   \n\nOverall  I gave 5 stars even with the rude bartender because the show was great and everyone had a great time.  \n\nOh and seriously a must to stop by the Hustler store.  They have some awesome stuff in there!', ""THE SECRET IS TO TEXT/CALL YOUR DRIVER!  If you purchase a package that's supposed to include round trip limo  they DO NOT tell you how to get your free ride back  and then the hostess will argue with you about whether you purchased the right package... 1/2 of my party was forced to pay for a cab ride home  and the other 1/2 that stayed longer had to keep arguing with the hostess & wait at least 30min after they finally agreed to let them take the limo home!  Thomas was annoyed to handle my complaint  but he did refund the prepaid money for the 1/2 of the group that paid the cab fare instead of getting the full benefit of the package we paid for.\n\nOther than that  I really enjoyed the time I spent there for my bachelorette party.  The men are very good looking and encourage you to touch if you're into that kind of thing ;)  Very entertaining show  though I wish I remembered more of what happened after I went up on stage lol  They're pretty generous with their included drink coupons..."", 'The DJ plays great music! Drinks are strong! Dancers are sexy!!! Our bride is having the time of her life with the lap dances. Really enjoyed the champagne offered in our section. Good times were had by all!', ""Was not overly impressed. We have been talking about Hunk Mansion for a friend's bachelorette party for months and decided to finally book- the reviews sounded great  and we were so excited about the mechanical penis! We were all ready to throw down however much it would cost to get the bachelorette a ride on it! We called to book our reservation and the guy on the phone was rude. We specifically had questions about when to arrive in order to be able to sit all together and he told us he wouldn't be able to seat us together unless we reserved a table for more money. The table reservation included two free drink tickets each so we went ahead with it. Our driver was very nice and the ride was pleasant  but we arrived at Hustler? Everyone kept reassuring us this was actually Hunk Mansion though there was not a single sign that said anything confirming we were actually in the right location. We were able to go in fairly quickly  but in order to get to the male strip club  they walked us through the female strip club  which once again did not make us feel like we were in the right place since Hunk Mansion was so advertised as being geared towards women. When we got up to the venue the view was nice  both in scenery and eye candy  but the place was empty except one other party. Good thing we were pressured into buying the more expensive package to get a table together! We were swarmed with good looking guys  very nice  but also VERY persistent in pressuring us to buy expensive dances and drinks. I went with my friend to use our free drink tickets- she ordered champagne and I ordered wine. As she was talking to me  I witnessed the bartender begin to pour her glass of champagne  then when he thought we weren't looking  swap to another unlabeled bottle that was already open  then when she turned around he finished it off with the original champagne bottle. I told her what had happened and the bartender denied switching bottles even though I had watched him! He ended up giving her the rest of the mini champagne bottle for free after we complained. Later on we decided to buy shots- the special was $5 Malibu shots  and when they came out they were pink! Since when is Malibu pink? I might have overlooked all this if they actually had a mechanical penis as advertised  but there was none to be found. :( This was not our first rodeo  but definitely our last at Hunk Mansion."", 'I would like to give a huge shout out to Thomas at Hunk Mansion.  He rolled out the red carpet for me and my two sisters (neither had ever been to a strip club before) last night on short notice. He had the limo pick us up..the driver was in constant contact so we knew when and where to meet. Getting in the club was a smooth process and i LOVE the new venue!! The guys were hot  there were plenty to pick from and a nice variety ..especially for a Thursday night!  We had a great time and the guys were good with my sisters who were a bit ""uptight"" at first..haha.. The other women all appeared to be having a great time as well whether they were there for a bachelorette party  part of a couple or group of ladies. I must say..well done Thomas and Men of Hunk Mansion', 'Mannnn do I have lots to say about this place  good and bad. We came here for a bachelorette party on 11/4/17 that we pre-booked with a group of us girls; had no idea where it was until I realized its part of the Hustler Club. \n\nGood: \nThe place is pretty nice! There is a bar  a stage  plenty of seats and tables  as well as an outdoor area (outdoor area was my fav)! Everything was fairly clean and nice- as well as the restrooms! Not as large as Sapphires stage and room  but still well done. \n\nThe amount they charged us to get in was fairly reasonable? I believe $30-45 which includes transportation and two well drinks. (Not exactly sure which deal we got)\n\nAlso You have some pretty awesome people working there! \nIxtsel (the hostess at the front)  David (our host/server at the table)  Trent (behind the bar  and Marcus (the DJ) were all a great help. They answered any and all questions I Had and were very friendly! Trent and David helped us finally get some water after asking several times and Ixtsel even sent a follow up email to me that night! When all of us were waiting on paid dances for the bride  maid of honor  and friends  DJ Marcus was able to reassure me they had gotten it  helped us stay on a schedule  and let us know when to be ready. \nThank you to them!\n\nBad:\n1. The bus taking us to the event was hard to contact and did not finally contact us until 20 minutes after I had talked to another man. We were late and picked us up about 40-45 minutes after the original pick up time. Do you know how stressed that makes a Maid of Honor with everyone at the hotel room?! \n\n2. Once we got there and had gotten seated  we had so many people who worked there telling us we had to move  then that we didn\'t have to move  then that we had to pay $200  then that we had to pay $400 on top of the entrance fee. \nPLEASE- just give us a manager and let them tell us the exact amount. \n\n3. Afterwards when we did get a manager  we were told that it was the wrong table that they had to talk to and that we were able to stay. -_-\nBut of course only AFTER one of us has paid 300 for a bottle because we thought we had to leave. Way to hustle!\n\n4. Obviously these guys work on tips/lap dance money. So yes  some of them are fairly aggressive. If you\'re not good at saying no  don\'t go here. Luckily I\'m pretty good at eyeing them to back off hahahahha \n\n5. The bride had to pee as soon as we got out of the place. Most places don\'t let you back in  which is fine. Just don\'t blame it on her being ""too drunk"". Just say it\'s because we need to pay again to enter. We get it.\n\n6. The entertainment was fairly slow. At some points no one was on stage and you could barely figure out why you paid money and you were sitting there with no guys around. Every now and then a show would take place with some guy and their lap dance person  after the DJ would call for that person 5x to get them on stage. No schedules. Also  very rarely was I impressed with some of the guys ""dancing"". At least they look good  right? \n\n7. Obviously the ATM is a NO GO other than your bank. There are always fees when using ATMs. No matter what. But normally it\'s around 3.75 high. NOPE. This one charged $12. DONT DO IT. \n\n8. Don\'t bother checking in for that ""Free Shot"". Didn\'t even work when I went up and asked for that person. AND you get a nasty look like you faked the check in offer. I never want to feel that way when presenting a Yelp check in offer. \n\nTo summarize: Hunk mansion is within the Hustler club- and you will get hustled. Hold your ground  call for management when needed for your ride because they won\'t call you to tell you their late  ask when in doubt about pricing and ASK for a manager rather than taking word from 4 different hosts  don\'t think you\'ll get anything without nagging for it  and be friendly with the staff. Some of them can make your night- and give the place more stars.', 'In town for a bachelorette party and really wanted the bride to be entertained. We paid $30 per person for a party bus to take use there and back as well as entrance fee and 2 drinks. Lap dances were $25 cash and $70 for the stage one. I think it was worth it very entertaining. Diversity of the men was good  multi racial all flavors. I do think some guys were better than others. I wish they were more oiled up. Props to Colby? Kobe? He was so entertaining and ladies into halfies he was half korean and polish cute in the face.', ""This was the best thing I've done in a long time...the guys are incredible.

Unbelievable service here from the staff  completely ruins the experience and wasn't cheap"", ""My last review has Thomas making a comment that i must be a competitor.  I would like to state clearly that neither my friend or myself even live in Nevada much less have anything to do with a strip club except visit when we come to town. But his response to my critical review only solidified my overall opinion of how things are run at the male venue at Hunk Mansion.  Instead of trying to rectify a situation or improve customer service..they blame the customers. .accuse them of being fake...or don't even respond.  Your competition doesnt need to put fake posts on Yelp. .you make yourself look bad with your poor service on the front and back end! !!"", ""Celebrated by besties bachelorette party here. I had requested a limo but was picked up in a party bus instead:/ no music  no fun. When we got to the venue our seating arrangement wasn't the most comfortable one either.

It was fun!"", ""I went with a group of 11 ladies for a bachelorette party. Besides walking through our group on the way to the stage  the guys gave us no attention at all. I actually had to get up and walk around to find a guy standing around to give my friend a dance. We all had money to spend and couldn't get a guy to come over to us. \n\nAlso  we were sitting near the guys' dressing room and I could hear them complaining about having to go on stage for another dance. It was only 10 o'clock  so I'd hate to see them by 2! \n\nWhile OG isn't as nice of a venue  the guys and the service is a thousand times better. \n\nOverall bad experience. We're actually planning a make-up bachelorette party for my friend at OG."", 'My husband and I come to Vegas about once a month and for a while we\'d been considering finding a ""couples friendly"" club that had male and female revues.  After contacting Tom ""very fast to respond"" to make sure it was couples friendly we booked our VIP pass with round trip Limo service and waited eagerly for the weekend!\n\nWe were picked up with a gold Escalade which was clean and comfortable.  Driver was very amicable and kept the conversation going (return trip was prompt).  The check in process at the front was quick and easy  the girl at the male review was prompt and explained the rules and prices clearly.  My husband can watch the basic lap dances but he\'d have to wait outside on the private dances.  No big deal.  We were seated about three rows back from the stage but its an intimate venue so all seats are good.  \n\nAt first  the guys didn\'t approach and I can understand they probably don\'t know how to gauge if a husband is going to flip out or not...so I decided to put the money out on the table to give the hint that we were there to have a good time and later when I wanted dances I had my husband give the guys the money and ask for me so they could know he\'s cool with it.  \n\nGuido was the first one to come say ""Hi.""  So I treated myself to a basic dance with tips.  Don\'t underestimate Guido he has awesome control of his body and is very friendly!  Romeo was also awesome!  Was waiting for his stage performance from the get go and I bought a private from him.  Very sexy!  \n\nLoved watching the guys on stage  the place was full of energy!  Loved the up close and personal feel of the event.  Guys are friendly and live for the opportunity to make you feel special for a Jackson or two or three.  \n\nIf you are a big girl like me don\'t be intimidated the guys are there to show you a good time.  They were very courteous to my husband  they acknowledged his presence and shook his hand.  I had a great time  he had a great time!  We cannot wait to come back!\n\nSome tips for others:\n1)  This is not a commercial male review with cheesy dance routines where you sit 20 rows back and just stare.  This is an intimate exposure with beautiful diversified men in real life.  They are touchable  conversational and available for special attention in the form of lap dances  stage dances and privates.  If you are not cool with that  go see the missing thunder and rainbow team of chip and dales.\n\n2) Lap dances leave you feeling a little special and little exposed.  Stage dances leave you feeling very special and very exposed.  Private dances leave you feeling extremely special in an intimate setting.  Pick your pleasure! :)', ""Very disappointing. Booked my friend's bachelorette party there and I would definitely not suggest it to anyone else. I paid $300.00 plus tax for the whole thing...limo service and one dance for the bride on stage...oh and a cheap ass lighted tiara. Says on the website there is a 2 drink minimum for each party guest and lists the price of drinks at 12.50 and up...so on top of the $300 for a bachelorette package  each girl then had to shell out another $30 at the door for 2 very shitty drinks. Venue was tiny with hardly any room near the stage so quite a few of us had drinks spilled on us by other guests and dancers....and the mechanical riding cock wasn't even working which was just total shit. The place is pretty shady and dirty looking and they had maybe one to two good male stippers. I had to give it one star because it wouldn't let me give it a zero. Never again.Don't waste your money ladies it isn't worth it...we should have just gone clubbing."", ""My first thought when I walked in was Holy Crap IT'S RAINING MEN! Lots of hot guys with six pack abs and gorgeous faces. The men are so kind  playful and sexy. If you want romance or seduction  they will give it to you. If you want to be picked up and thrown around  you'll get that. My suggestions are to come with plenty of cash (atm fee is $25)  take their transportation  and spend most of your money on the lap dances ($20) rather than on the stage. Buy dances for your friends and they'll buy dances for you until you're comfortable buying your own."", ""We took my BFF to the Hunk Mansion last week for her 50th Birthday. We had the time of our life. The dancers were extremely sexy and went above and beyond  to make sure we had the time of our lives. My favorite was Tyson ( I think I'm in Love). Make sure to make a reservation  they will\nPick you up and drop you off from your hotel. You also get two free drinks if you make a reservation. We are already planning on going back in March!"", ""We're celebrating 2 bachelorettes and from the point of booking online to the end of the night was perfect!! There was continue communication between Thomas  TJ (our driver) to London. Everything was fun  fun  fun!"", ""I had previously written a review giving Hunk Mansion one star because of an incident that occurred when I was given change after purchasing a drink. I am changing my rating from 1 star to 5 stars (which is the rating I would have given before the incident with my change)  because the management of Hunk Mansion was diligent in responding to my concerns. Without making excuses they explained that they lease the space from Larry Flynt's Hustler Club. Regardless of who was responsible  I appreciate good customer service  and the follow up by both Tenya and Thomas was just that. I really enjoyed the show and will definitely return on my next trip to Vegas. I'll just make sure to carefully inspect my change before leaving the bar :)."", ""This was definitely way more fun than expected. Went for my sister's bachelorette with 12 girls and we had a blast. The men were beautiful and super fun not overly aggressive like we imagined. It's worth paying to get your guest of honor on stage...she'll thank you for it later. The cowboy was #1 on most of our lists but there's someone for every taste."", ""My first time at a male club and I didn't know what to expect when I walked in with our group. It must've been a dead night as there were a few other women around the tiny ramp they called the stage. The lighting and the overall bare look of the place is what hit me the most. We had to get our own watered down drinks as there was one waitress who didn't bother coming around. I would highly recommend you know what you're signing up for one of their 'routines' when you get a stage dance for $60. I'll know what to expect on my next visit. Why come back? The men! They had the charm and persona to match their six packs and I love how they can read what you want and give you exactly that. We ended up spending the night hanging out with a couple of sweet  funny guys who made us feel so comfortable and not out of place at all. Cheers  Randy!! Aka  Mojito :) \nPlease get an upgrade  a good interior design and some mood lighting  HM!!:)"", 'Hunk Mansion is the ultimate night club for erotic entertainment with gorgeous hunks to fulfill your wildest fantasies. We had the most amazing night and experiences to match . We plan to make other trips back to Hunk Mansion real soon. Look out Vegas here we come !', ""This is my favorite strip club whenever I'm in Vegas. The men here are all very talented and sexy. My favorite stripper is ecstasy he is so sexy!!! And I love the way he dance. The drinks are very good not water down at all. Let's not forget about the DJ he was total bad ass playing all the hottest songs. My friends and I will be back again In November 2017"", ""Went here for Bachorlete party. We were picked up by a SUV. The guy was about 20 minutes late but apologized when picking up saying something about traffic. He was a fast driver & made us feel comfortable when being in his vehicle.\nI was nervous when walking in because of the intimidating bouncers that greet you at the door. When you walk in there is a giant penis which is funny to take pics with. There is a guys side and girls side. Way more girl dancers then guys. We went to the section with the male dancers. The dancer who came to talk to me was Guido Torpedo. I told him right away I was not very comfortable & a little freaked out for what may be in store for me. Guido was very comforting & instead of acting how I thought a stripper would be he was sweet & listened to me babble for hours.I got a personal lap dance from him & before the dance he actually asked what I would like to see him in. \nI giggled like a school girl & told him I was not into g-strings or sparkly outfits. I asked if her had just a pair of jeans. He laughed & said he has his street clothes & usually doesn't wear them because they are restricting when dancing  but said he would do it for me. When he came back I was still very nervous to get the dance so he gave me a few while I downed some drinks with the girls trying to get some liquid courage. When he came back the dance was great. I felt comfortable & he was not too pushy at all. For the 3-6 minutes he was dancing I was lost in the moment. Thanks to him for a great 1st time dancer experience. He represents your company well. The bartender that looks like Little Wayne was awesome. He kept our drinks flowing & was very easy to talk to. He was also smiling the whole night & taught me how to use a condom. On a HOOKAH that is. My only complaint about the mens side was a older blonde woman that must have been a manager of some sort. She lingered at the end of the bar & I felt like she was watching us the whole time. Very awkward feeling. The DJ was also cool & let us girls over take his booth requesting any dumb song we wanted. The place was empty so it felt like the whole place was to ourselves.\nThe girls side was a lot bigger. When we walked over there TRENCH was preforming. We danced & singed along to all of his songs. Even got to sit in VIP with COOLIO.\nYes  he is still alive. The drinks by the male strippers were decently priced but on the other side I paid $15 for a Corona. Ouch.\nThe dancer were all kind making small talk whenever we would run into them. All around a cool place to have a little party at. And again Guido Torpedo was the best."", ""Went here for a friend's bachelorette party. We didn't know what to expect since it was our first time in a place like this  but overall we had a lot of fun. For only $25pp  we were piked up in an SUV  given tickets for 2 free drinks  and had access to both the male and female strip areas. The bartenders were great  the place was packed and the shows were quite entertaining. Definitely a must go place for a bridal party if you don't want to spend tons on going to the shows like Chippendales and Thunder From Down Under."", ""Okay I got a package deal it said we will picked up by a limo but instead we got pick up by a suv with no air conditioner. Then we arrive to the club went us stairs the men were okay but some were drity and creepy. At the end of our night it said that our driver was suppose to take us back to our hotel but he didn't I called him 3 times no answer. So I suggest u look other places maybe stripper King. I would give this place no stars. Very disappointed with this place and service."", 'Our bachelorette group had so much fun. The staff was friendly and service was great. But mainly the dancers were fantastic!!!! So much fun.', 'Had a great time at the hunk mansion! The guys are ripped  friendly  and put on a great show - what more could you want?? For $20 bucks extra  we got a round trip limo ride which was a nice touch. The mansion is definitely a must for bachelorettes or anyone who wants to unwind. The host  Thomas  will personally see to it that you have a good time. Unparalled customer service! Will definitely be back here again.', ""I've been here twice  the second time was much better than the first  definitely coming back!  However  the reason why I'm giving 4 stars is because there was lack of communication due to transportation and payment.  The strippers are awesome though!  Had a great time."", ""Recently  I learned that there's a shortage of male strip clubs and revues in Las Vegas. That's definitely news to someone (me) who doesn't think the concept is appealing. With that being said  I was actually the one who found this place -- via Yelp  heh -- and suggested to my female cousins -- who are male strip club aficionados --  that they add Hunk Mansion to their itinerary. In short  I ended up going for the hell of it to see why they get so worked up over guys gyrating in sparkly thongs.\n\nEntry fee to the club is $25. This price includes two free drink tickets and shuttle service from your hotel  via Hustler bus. That's a pretty sweet deal considering how entry fees alone to some of the clubs on The Strip are around the same price.\n\nHunk Mansion is located inside Larry Flynt's Hustler Club that's just a short drive from the south end of The Strip. It's a small  intimate room that's next door to where the women perform. It's equipped with a bar  large stage  and plenty of seating and tables. \n\nThe free drinks we ordered were weak and diluted  and the paid drinks were the opposite. But hey  can't complain much about free drinks.\n\nWe had to wait for a couple of groups to arrive before the performances started. Amateurs kick-off the night  and it's up to the ladies to decide if they're Hunk Mansion material. Once that's done  the resident performers get on stage. The whole time I was expecting bump and grind movements  but I gotta give some of these performers props for climbing up 10 foot poles and doing some Cirque du Soleil-like tricks. If I can't do that  then they deserve some of my singles to pay for their college tuition. \n\nFrom what I've been told  the men at Hunk Mansion are more attractive than the performers at other male strip clubs and revues in Vegas. There were a few dancers who were on the douchey side and all talk and no game. However  in general  the guys at the club were polite and didn't pressure us into paying for dances. Few even came around to ask if we were enjoying the show. Staff members even came by to check on everyone and make sure that they were having a great time. I can't recall all of their names  but my cousins went crazy for Xavier  Trey  Pitbull  Silk  and Superman. Give those guys money.\n\nI think Hunk Mansion is an ideal place for a bachelorette party or just to visit with friends who enjoy this particular type of entertainment. I'm still not a fan  but the experience was better than I thought it was going to be. It gets my seal of approval. Have fun  ladies! And don't forget to do a Yelp check-in to receive a light-up tiara. \n\nAnd this marks my 400th review!"", ""Bar service is great.  Drinks never went empty.  Dancers are hit and miss.  If you are gay  not the place.  This is aimed towards women and bachelorette parties.  Very warm so wear something light.  Wouldn't come back."", 'This place is a BLAST!!! I went here for a bachelorette party with a group of girl friends and had an incredible time! I honestly couldn\'t stop thinking about all the lovely men after I left. :P\n\nNot only did all of the dancers have AMAZING bodies  they were all super cute too!!! And very talented! I was so impressed with how they all worked the poles --- LOVED the ones hanging from the ceiling. They were all  ahem  super ""creative"" with their sexy moves while hanging above the ladies!\n\nWe paid to have the bride put on stage. We spoke to the dancer before she went up and explained she\'s a little shy and not to go too crazy. He did an awesome job of respecting our request - she ended up with a very sensual and impressive dance!!!!\n\nI also LOVED how all the dancers had different acts and costumes. It made was so entertaining and fun! We were all cracking up and giving screams of encouragement the whole night. I\'ve done Thunder Down Under and was disappointed -- it was basically a slightly more risque Back Street Boys dance routine. Also  only one or two brides in the audience actually get special attention. EVERYONE who wants some attention at Hunk Mansion gets it! Annnnnnd it\'s fantastic! :D\n\nAlso  the owner Thomas was fantastic! He checked in on us throughout the whole night - making sure we were all happy and having a good time. He confirmed our reservation via text before we got picked up and kept in communication with me to make sure everything went off without a hitch! I wanted to really dazzle the girls with a limo to pick us up  so Thomas made sure one was available to get us!!! You can tell he really cares about his customers!\n\nI HIGHLY recommended this for bachelorette parties  birthdays  or just if you want to have an extra special night with your girl friends!!', ""Started at about a one star...we didn't get into vegas until after 830 which was the last pick up time so we found our own ride here...lyft. we spoke with people twice saying that was ok. getting in was horrible and confusing. Having fun inside with the cute guys had brought it back up to a four. \nNow we're trying to use our included ride back and the person isn't responding and the door people are rude as fudge...to be updated later....\nJust downgraded to one because this is freaking ridiculous"", 'Does Hunk Mansion exist or is it Hustler??! I chose hunk mansion to avoid the possibility of running into the boys at the bachelor party. Luckily the boys were not there since we had to go through the women section to get to the male section. The limo driver was very very rude and it was insanely hot in the limo!!! The males at the venue were good....but not enough variety. The view and the actual venue was great though...and the drink prices were well priced.', 'I owe this place a solid review. First time at a male strip club for my bachelorette party weekend. We came here Friday night and did a Chippendales show Saturday night. Although Chippendales was nice  the men at Hunk Mansion are what we all look back on fondly! This place is inside of Hustler Club. Decently priced drinks  nice management and beautiful men. A night for the books. Highly recommend.', ""Just want to say thank you to Thomas for setting up a great night for us. Any time we have a special occasion for one of us girls in our group we call Thomas and he tells us the best package to get and sets up our limo transportation and makes sure he has a table reserved for us. He's always helpful and tells you like it is. We always leave there having the best time ever! I highly recommend this place for all you girls out there wanting to have a good time. We can't wait to go back!!"", ""Very fun place! I always have a good time when I go to hunk mansion. I'm surprised to read that someone on here wrote the cowboy is aggressive ... He isn't aggressive at all!!!! Especially compared to male strippers at other places. And he is definitely the hottest guy there!"", ""My friends and I came to check this club out for the first time in July 2013. We paid $45 for the VIP admission  which included reserved seats  limo pick up and drop off  and two drinks. The dancers are very friendly and personable  and the acts were varied and exciting. The guys are very ripped and give you plenty of attention. They don't mind if you take pictures  either. We were treated to shots of tequila so that was pretty cool  too. When I checked in on yelp  they didn't have light up tiaras but they gave me a giant Hustlers cup filled with tons of awesome goodies. There's also a mechanical penis ride which makes for great laughs and photos. Hunk Mansion is definitely worth checking out  especially for bachelorette parties or anyone wanting some eye candy (or more). Shout out to the cute bartender and Superman! Oh  and Thomas-super awesome host that will personally see to it that you're having a good time. Amazed by the customer service! This was a lot of fun and I can't wait to come back!"", ""If I could give this place 10 stars I would! First off  it was my birthday weekend and where better to spend it than VEGAS?! My best friend told me she wanted to take me to a strip club (my first experience at one) and let me just say that I was NOT disappointed. For start  it was only $30 for a ride to the club  admission & 2 drinks! When I got there  I was a little intimidated since I have never been to a strip club before  but all I can say is that from the manager (nice lady) to all the GORGEOUS SEXY BEAUTIFUL men  EVERYONE made myself and my girlfriends feel so welcome and comfortable. They were not aggressive or rude  they were all very kind and sweet and GORGEOUS (did I already say that?). My friend bought me a staged lap dance for $60 with my FAVORITE (Maggio) oh god  that man is just too damn fine. I felt a bit nervous  being a plus size lady myself to get up on that stage  but let me tell you they make you feel so comfortable! It was so fun and raunchy ;) All in all  I would highly recommend this place  especially if you've never been to a strip club and are a little intimidated. :) :) :) *still smiling*"", ""A great night of fun!!! I went a couple weeks ago with a bachelorette party and had a great time! \nMy favorite dancer was Guido the Torpedo. He did amazing things on the bars - really made me sad that my friend and I were the only ones paying him attention and tipping him. \nMy favorite personality has to be Maverick hands down. He was amusing and talkative and kept coming back for more. Those two for sure earned the very last of my dollars! \nThe cowboy had hung around for a bit but as soon as one of the girls got a lap dance he didn't come back around. I know others were thinking of a lap dance at that point so he missed out!\nThe other guys were great as well but we didn't spend as much time with them. \nWe had a great time overall and would definitely go back if only to see Guido and Maverick again.

The only unfortunate thing was just that the place was DEAD. We went on a Thursday night and it was just us and around 2 other groups. The company just need to work on promoting themselves and get more people to go because it was a lot of fun. \n\nAdditionally  I don't think people clean the limos well. Since it was dark in the limo  I just sat down and there was water on the seat. I left the limo with sad water stain on my dress. -_-\n\nAlso  ladies please bring enough money for the dancers.

We showed up & the place was empty... Weird to think since it was on a Saturday. One of the dancers was being rude to one of my girlfriends & thought that was very unprofessional. They only had about 4 dancers the whole night so we kept seeing the same show over & over again. Overall  we won't be going back."", ""I was totally underwhelmed. There wasn't anything sensual about the way the guys were dancing. It was just a series of tricks I could see any dancer do in the subway. I couldn't get anyone's attention for a drink.

We left  having blown 70 dollars for nothing."", ""Hands down the most fun experience you'll have in Vegas with a group of girls  especially a bachelorette or birthday party. Why should guys be the only ones to have all the fun at strip clubs? The dancers here are not only handsome but sweet- you can tell they are also having a blast. The on stage dances are awesome and you'll feel like you're watching Magic Mike. Here's a tip- it's worth it to pay for the bachelorette or birthday girl to get an on stage dance. The pictures will be amazing."", 'Our group of 9 went in for a bachelorette party and had booked one of the bachelorette packages.  While we had a GREAT time  and the men were hot  sexy  and super fun  we had an unfortunate experience with a dance ticket and getting hustled.  The dancers only make money from tips or private and on-stage dances (this is what the dance ticket is for)  and they are smooth talkers.  Understandably so.  Our party had a fun experience after a rough start  which is why I gave three stars instead of four.  Would recommend with a heads up.', 'We had a great time at Hunk Mansion!

We had the best time ever!"", 'Not to impressed.  The dancers are very pushy and money hungry. I understand they are there to make money but to stand around talking shit about the other dancers and saying how they are better was a huge turn off.

I never thought I would say this but Chippendales was alot more fun.', ""Came with the girls a few weeks ago as my friend was getting married.  Club was very nice and the lady that seated us couldn't be more accommodating.  Place was clean and the dj played a good mix.\nWe were all feeling pretty good and maybe the bride a little too good lol.  I got her a lap dance with Romeo.  He seemed like a nice guy.  What was very disturbing to me was that the bride was a little drunk and I saw that Romeo was taking advantage of her.  He had his hand all the way up her dress which was very upsetting and them I saw him grab her hand and but it on his private.which he pulled out.  \nThis was so inappropriate and I felt he totally took advantage of her .\nI think it is fine to have fun but when someone crosses the line  that is going way to far.\nClub is nice if you stay away from him."", 'The best night of my life.

This was the highlight of our trip and I highly recommend other bachelorettes coming here. The guys don\'t pressure you if you are shy  they will let you sit back and watch until you get into it  and trust me you will get into it. It was like magic mike  i was in heaven. My girls paid for me to go on stage and I couldn\'t stop laughing the entire time.

We got the $300 bachelorette party package deal and it included a party bus to pick us up and back  lap dance on stage  light up tiara  champagne  and 2 cocktails each person mandatory (you pay at the entrance). I will definitely come back on special gno events! Thanks Hunk Mansion for showing us girls an awesome time!', ""I've been pondering this review for some time... I don't want it to in any way convince other's not to go to Hunk Mansion  as I think it's just not my personal cup of tea (especially considering all the other 5 stars).   \n\nAfter doing some heavy yelp research  I settled on Hunk Mansion for my best friend's bachelorette party.  Personally  I had never been to a male strip club (no there isn't real nudity here  they stay in thongs) but the reviews were great  and riding the mechanical penis sounded like it was right up our alley.   We saw on the website that $25 would get you a ride to and from  2 drink tickets and entry.  We called around 11pm (after our initial contact on the contact form was ignored) and a limo driver showed up right on time at midnight as we had asked.  The driver was awesome  friendly and allowed us to take many a drunken photo in front of the limo - the limo itself was a bit old  but nothing worth complaining about.  Once dropped off he told us he would be our ride back to the hotel whenever we were ready.\n\nInside  I checked in on yelp... both cashiers looked confused when I mentioned the yelp check in offer (the light up tiara) and eventually decided who ever was in charge of that wasn't there that evening (it was a Sunday).  Strike one  but whatever.  Then we were told the price was $30 something a person.  I told them the website had said $25.  They then said the price was $28 a person  and then dropped it lower to $25.  Anyways  I was a bit annoyed but still enjoying the fun.  \n\nWe walked straight to the back  bypassing the female dancer area  and stopped at the area to get dollar bills.  Service here was much slower than any other strip club I've ever been to!   Some of the girls stopped at the bar here too  this was insanely slow... and to top it off the mechanical penis was broken!! \n\nContinuing on we ended up in the male dancer section.  It was empty  perhaps due to it being so late on a Sunday night.   It seemed weird to me that there wasn't a guy on stage at all times  but this may be due to the fact that there were only about 4 guys.  The guys came over  and like the other reviewers mentioned they tried to take time to talk to us... nice I guess  but didn't interest me much.  Plus I felt as though they were desperately begging for money....  after about an hour we finally ditched the guys and had a much better time watching the female strippers do some incredible pole climbing tricks....\n\nAll in all  it was an ok night  ended badly when we had to get a taxi back to our hotel though - apparently our driver was busy driving someone else for an hour!  The party also spent some time in the Hustler store connected to the club which was fun."", 'I have been to both female and male strip clubs in Vegas. And I\'ve got to say that these guys are actually great and pretty talented. Them moves are better than the girls  whaat haha\n\nCame here awhile back with couple of friends. I loved that they picked us up with a limo. However  I didn\'t like the attitude of the limo driver. He was grumpy and complained about picking up girls etc. \n\nAnyways  the place itself was well maintained and had a very friendly and helpful host as well as a bartender. A cute bartender. \n\nIf you are crazy and want to dive into it  I suggest sitting in the front. If you want to just watch  I suggest sitting in the back.\n\nOverall  it was a great experience and definitely a place to try  if you are out with your girls. But keep your girlfriends away from emotionally attaching to the guys. I\'ve seen it happen! Don\'t do it! \n\nOnly negative comment I have for this place is that the strippers seemed too desperate for money. I am not exaggerating when I say that. No means no  If I don\'t want a dance from you. But the guys kept trying too hard to sell themselves  and even said ""I am just trying to make money here  you know. This is my job."" Well  what a turn off. It wasn\'t like I was not going to buy any lap dances. I ended up buying a lap dance for a friend from a different guy. I think he was the ""superman."" He didn\'t pressure us into anything at all and made sure my friend was comfortable  which was nice. \n\nPlease  don\'t pressure the customers too much. Otherwise  it\'s a #byefelicia', ""Sold! Me and my best friend decided we needed a little good clean fun.  Having never been to a male strip club before   we hoped on yelp and started looking. Hunk Mansion had great reviews compared to every other place we came across.  We called the club for more info. We were treated great right off the bat.  So   we decided to give it a go. \nThe club sent a white stretch limo to our hotel for pick up. Us two girls had the whole limo to ourselves where we pregamed and prepared for the night ahead. The Limo was free(we tipped the driver well) we payed a $25 cover that included two free drinks from their fully stocked bar. \nAll the employees were friendly the club was clean and nicely set up  (the male club is a small section of the over all huge Hustler club/ store). \nWhat a blast! Most of the men were tall buff and ready to please! (with the exception of a few smaller boy like men   but Ehh everyone's tastes are different). The bartender was an absolute Hunk! \nThe men not only do a fantastic job dancing and working the stage   but they are very sensual and hands on with us ladies. Love Logan! \nOverall. A Fantastic night! We're both hooked and will definetly be spending a lot of time here seeing as we're frequent LA to LV weekenders. \nIt was obvious that all the women were loving it. It was great fun encouraging and cheering on the other ladies in the joint. We all bonded over the joys of naked men   there's even times where all the women are encouraged to hop on stage to dance and work the poles. \nOverall best experience I could have dreamed of. Not a disappointing moment all night. \n-If you can't beat em   join em.-\n We will forever be Regulars to the male strip club scene. \nThank you Hunk Mansion for an exceptional night!"", 'Where do I even begin.....\n\nQuick note for those of you that don\'t want to read everything I am writing... just know that EVERYTHING THEY ADVERTISE IS FALSE.\n\nFirst off  Hunk Mansion is really Hustlers. Honestly this place was not what was advertised. \n\nFrom the beginning the driver was 50 minutes late to pick us up from our hotel. The website said  ""first come first serve."" We did not want to be late and miss out on our table. The driver said to us  ""Don\'t worry! there\'s only 5 drivers and we are all running behind. If you where ready then you should have called me to get you sooner!"" Wish this would have been communicated to me sooner. Once the driver picked us up  he was honestly an awesome man. I would give Raul 5 stars alone. He gave me his own card and told me to call him 30 minutes before I needed to be picked up and he was right on time for pick up. Raul really made up for being late. \n\nArriving.... We went in through a side elevator...REALLY SKETCHY!! The ""bouncer"" was really sketchy also. The bouncer mentions the 1st and 2nd floor where girl strippers and the top floor was men.\n\nRight when we sat down we where bombarded with men asking us for dances. Honestly  I know you need to make your money  but give us a second to put our stuff down and get our drinks!! You would make better money if you make things about the ""Customers."" \n\nI previously paid for a bottle service online through the ""Hunk Mansion Website."" I had to ask for our bottle 4  times before I was told to go walk up to the manager up front. Fine! I did so. We finally receive our bottle and glasses. Cheap bottle! AND ALL THE WINE GLASSES STILL HAD LIPSTICK ALLLLLL OVER THEM!!!!! I did not drink my Champagne in fear that I would get something from the F-ing glass!! This is not SANITARY!!! We had to ask for new glasses...\n\nNext..... Online advertised a ""$60 Cash"" Dance on stage of a ""Dancer You Want and Pay Him Direct."" This was not the case. I had to walk up front to pay some guy and find out that ""the dance is no longer $60. My manager changed it last week to $75."" I told them that I saw the add for $60 and asked if they could honor that. The said ""No  $75 or nothing."" Fine!! Gave them the $75 and said  ""I know what guys my sister wants a dance from. The add says she gets to pick the dancer. ""They said ""No  she doesn\'t get to pick."" We where also promised a Tiara for The bride  but we never received that. Everything they advertised was FALSE!!  ( I will attach pictures of what was advertised). \n\nHonestly  I did everything I could to just get my sister drunk so she wouldn\'t pay attention to the little things. \n\nSide note: The dancers here were really good  but extremely aggressive. \n\nI could go on and on about this place  but I will leave it at that. I hope everyone else has better experiences.', ""Went with a couple of friends last week and had a blast! For $30  we got a free limo ride to the club  entry  and 2 drinks. For some reason most of the male strip clubs are only open on Friday-Saturday  but Hunk Mansion opens on Thursdays. The guys are cool (not creepy and gross at all) and you will have a great time. I will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas. **They also have a luggage room in case you wanna make a quick stop on your way to the airport lol**"", 'Came here for my sister\'s bachelorette party and we had a pretty good time! It was also our first time at a male strip-club so we really didn\'t know what to expect.\n\nIf this is your first time going to a male strip-club  here\'s a few things about this place:\n\n1. No photography - for reasons I\'m unsure of  they have a VERY strict no camera policy. The DJ WILL call you out if they see your phone out. My sister (the bride) --- who just so happen to have her phone in her hands while one of the performers were dancing on her --- got her phone taken away by the stripper himself AND -- WAIT FOR IT -- he dropped it down his crotch panties hahahahaha. The funniest part (and totally unrelated) is my sis is also a germaphobe so that was a treat in itself just seeing her cringe haha! But again  this might not be something other ladies will find humorous but do respect the house rules -- no photos/videos.\n\n2. THEY HUSTLE - these gentlemen DO live up to their name! Within 5 minutes of arriving  we had quite a few men coming up to us offering lap dances for $25. Now I get it  thats yo job  you do this stuff but they definitely don\'t beat around the bush. At some point  I felt like carcass being circled by vultures. And hey  some people like to get straight to the lap dance  I personally would have liked to get settled at our table first. But they do put on a show! They may come at you fast but they do very good job!\n\n3. Getting the bride on stage - $60+ something cash or $72-ish something on card. Needless to say  I had already spent all my cash on the performers so had to put this on the card ahhh.\n\n4. Maid of Honors - they\'ll target you too just watch.\n\n5. They are definitely handsy - I came to this club thinking YOU the ""lady"" would be putting your hands on THEM. But oh no  they touch you too. Not in a creepy  molesting kind of way but they do incorporate you in their dances  like a play-thing. Just something to think about if you\'re not comfortable with that.\n\n6. They are accommodating - our bridal party pitched in to put the bride and a bridesmaid on stage for a special dance. I requested earlier that they go ""a little easier"" on my sister since she\'s a bit more conservative and  they were more than happy to oblige. It was hilarious seeing the bride and her bridesmaid side by side getting lapdances of different caliber from the same man.\n\nAll in all -- we had a good time!!! Can\'t share the stories to my friends enough. At least next time  I\'ll be better prepared!', 'Great venue for bachelorette party! Great variety of men so there was eye candy for everyone! We had so much fun! If your celebrating an event pay to get the lucky girl on stage! It is TOTALLY worth it! Our bride to be had a great time! Thank you to all the hunks at Hunk Mansion!', ""Hunk Mansion was great! Small intimate room  clean and great guys. The guys were hot as well as total sweethearts. A couple of them were a little pushy trying to get you to buy lap dances  etc. But its their job and how they make their money so I understand.  It was my daughters 21st birthday and they were all really attentive. We paid the extra for her to get a special dance up on the stage and we weren't disappointed! Drinks were good  bartender was great too. We stayed for almost 5 hours....it was a blast! I'd highly recommend it to anyone wanting to let loose and have some fun. Limo service was great too! Not really any complaints. In our group was a woman in her 60s  1 in her 50s  2 in their 40s and 1 21 yr old and we all had an amazing time. If ever in Vegas again i will most certainly go to Hunk Mansion!!!"", ""Had a blast for bachelorette party  will be coming back to see phoenix he was my favorite one ( I'm in love  lol). I really didnt want to go but I ended up loving the place. Unfortunately after seeing these sexy men  regular guys seem unattractive. I highly recommend!"", 'Good looking dancer!  Exceptional car service to and from our location.  Thomas makes sure to make everything just right.', 'My girls and I went here for my bachelorette party night. My maid of honor called ahead and had a limo pick us up. The limo driver and party bus were clean on time and a blast. When we arrived Landon immediately greeted our group and gave us first class treatment. Giving me my light up tiara and checking on us all night.  We felt special right from the start.  The guys knew how to keep the party going and knew their business! Very impressed! It was an unforgettable night with top notch service  men and dancing!!! I will also add that the women of hustler were top notch as well! Thank you Landon and staff for the amazing service that is so rare in this day in age. You and the staff care about customer service and it shows in everything you offer at your club! \nWe highly recommend this club :) :)', ""I would post pictures of how my time here went  but then I would probably never be able to apply for jobs again.... Since anything goes in Vegas  we decided to come here at the very early hour of 7:30 since we had a busy night ahead of us. The call to make an appointment was easy and pleasant  and the limo arrived exactly at 7:30 to whisk us away to man paradise. \n\nEveryone there was SUPER nice and accomodating. Because the majority of people in Vegas were probably still sleeping off their hangovers at 7:30  we were the first people there and got to sit front row. Score! Not only did we get two nice  strong drinks and transportation for $25  but we also got a free shooters upon arrival! I suggest that all of you use this as the place to pregame before going anywhere else because drink prices are probably the most reasonable in all of Vegas....If you tip the driver well both ways  he will definitely also drive you back to your hotel after the show.\n\nAs for the men  they were all super nice and conversational while we waited for them to get on stage. I felt like we were almost at some networking event or something  but with less clothing and more props. The show was  for lack of better words  less of a show and more of a (literally) hands-on experience  which all 7 of us thought was great. Naturally  my friends decided to surprise me with a stage show for my birthday (but let's be real it was more of a gift of entertainment for themselves) in which the cowboy and I apparently put on quite the show for the audience. I don't think I closed my mouth once during the performance (mind out of the gutter people!!!)  it was obviously from surprise and laughter!"", ""Best male strip club in Las Vegas!  Came here for my best friend's bachelorette party.  Hot guys  cheap drinks and round trip limo just to name a few things as to why I love this place.  They have a 6' penis ride!!!!! Make sure your bachelorette wears something that lets her give it a shot  our bride had pencil skirt on and had to miss out. Great customer service  they really made us feel special and gave the bachelorette tons of attention.   Thomas was amazing for dealing with all the changes I had to make to the reservation  you're a SAINT!  Definitely will make sure the next bachelorette party I go to in Vegas will be here."", ""I had my first experience at Hunk Mansion just a few days ago for my cousin's bachelorette party. We had such a good time  & we all had a good experience there. The manager Karin was very nice  & made sure we all were having a good time & were enjoying ourselves. The guys were all really nice  especially Maggio  plus the two bartenders as well. The facility was very clean  & was a nice place. \nMy only complaint was that a few of the guys were a little pushing for their private dances. But  overall it is a great place to go.\nOne highlight of the night was seeing Andy Dick when we arrived  having him take a picture with my cousin who was the bachelorette."", ""Perfect place to go for a bachelorette party! Much more personalized experience than shows you can go to on the strip. Management was very helpful when a person in our party thought she lost her purse (we found it--phew!). I will be recommending this place to any ladies I know who are going to Vegas and I can't wait to go back myself."", 'Came here with my best friend to experience a male strip club for the first time... All I can say is ""TAKE ME BACK!"" We had an absolute BLAST! The only thing I regret is losing the bartenders number *snaps fingers* Damn! It was such an awesome crowd and the dancers were on point!! Looking forward to our next visit!', ""We went to this place to celebrate my friend's bachelorette part. All of us are first timers  we spent a wonderful and unforgettable night at this here! ! ! This is a must go place in Vegas for all girls! All the male strippers are very cute and dance professionally  loved their performance! As first timers we don't have experience  so I would suggest you to bring more CASH!!! Then your night will even better!"", 'This place is perfect for a girls night out or bachelorette party. They guys are all smoking hot and really friendly and fun. They want the girls in their club to have a good time. This place was clean and well maintained - I would absolutely go back', ""Absolutely  LOVE this place !!! We are here now !!! Was a little leary after some.reviews on here but DEFINITELY NOT DISAPPOINTED! !!!! Not too crowded but a good  crowd! ! The men are AWESOME !!! Some may not be  my style but  definitely  put on good show !!! Had an awesome time and very glad we chose Hunk Mansion over the other places !!!! All the staff are amazing too !!!! Will definitely  come back  next time in town !!!! Highly recommend! !!! Can't wait to come back !!!"", 'I\'ve visited here 3 times in the last few months. Each time my experience was better. I drove to Vegas from Reno. On my first trip down  Thomas was great on the phone  as we were running late. He said  pedal to the metal  but be safe. Our driver was wonderful. Arriving at the club we were greeted by Karin who went out of her way to make us feel important. DjJosh was great at making us blush. I was approached by Guido  and this guy has moves! Not only on stage but his lap dance was ""youza"". He made the night  incredible and memorable for me!\nSecond trip. I follow hunk mansion on  twitter  facebook and Instagram too. I tried their offer of texting for a package  and wow! Was not expecting the great offer. Our limo showed up promptly. The second time around  the staff was great at remembering me. DjJosh was giving me shout outs  and Guido had me in the biggest hug ever. Enjoyed my lap dances once again with Guido and got my first lap dance with Maggio! Great time!\nThird trip. I used the same texting deal and Tenya was great! Arrived yet again to have my two favorites there! Guido and Maggio!\nLadies  if you prefer lots of attention  I suggest you go on a Thursday night! Its not packed as a Friday or Saturday. The guys really give you 1 on 1 time. \nI want to thank Thomas  Karin  Tenya  DjJosh  and especially Guido and Maggio! \nCouldn\'t get there for my birthday yesterday  but will be there soon for my belated WIGGLE!

Skip the long line at McDonald's and head to Marathon for authentic  fresh  made-to-order Greek diner food.\n\nThe veggie gyro ($10) was filled with peppers  onions  mushrooms  spinach  tomatoes  lettuce  and feta cheese.  So good  and I almost feel like it was healthy?!  The guy working at the griddle (possibly the owner?) was really nice about asking whether I wanted banana peppers  cheese  etc.  so I'm sure they would accommodate special requests.  I love that Marathon offers a tasty and satisfying vegetarian option  because the cheese pizza slices at Villa just looked sad! \n\nObviously I was just here for dinner  but Marathon Diner serves breakfast too!  Definitely stop here if you are hungry in the Pittsburgh airport. You can really tell that they put a lot of love into the food!"", 'What a ripoff. For a $13 salad all you get is iceberg lettuce  a few measly shards of onion  cucumber and tomato  and some old tasting meat. So many better food court options.', ""This experience was a joy. The food was great. Service was great. I started out at the currito burrito. Without borders. They were rude. Went to marathon and they offered a frequent buyer card. \n\nSuch a great experience. I'll be back here."", 'The one at the airport is just ... bad the servers were bored and had the attitude that I was bothering them by ordering ... and the food was very average', ""Had an early flight and  wife and I were hungry. We noticed Marathon Diner. I must say it was the best we've had. The Big Fat Greek omelette was amazing. The service and food were all top notch. Wish they had one in our home state cause we would be regulars."", ""Incredible incredible vegetarian omelette  worth every penny. There's not a lot of things better than breakfast all day  but the amount of food and the quality of the omelette. If I ever come back to the Pittsburgh airport  I'm going straight back!"", ""Wow! What a great find. Great Greek breakfast with my new friends Kevin and Crystal at Marathon Diner. Right here to Pittsburgh airport I look forward to coming back just to be able to eat here. This is there only store let me tell you can get breakfast lunch everything is fabulous. And friendly coffee including decaf and their Tzaziki sauce is wonderful. Don't miss this when there's other restaurants here this is the one you should go to First"", 'Was recommended the gyro omelette. Fantastic  good amount of food  good service  good value.', 'Tried Marathon diner today & it did not disappoint. It has a wide selection menu for such a little place. Excellent marathon gyro & if they have the lemon chicken soup while reading this review  you gotta try it! Service is fast & the employees are friendly. Only down side is this is not a ""diner"" but more of a fast food counter.... although  if in a rush  that could be a plus! I\'ll be eating here again.', 'Best airport food by far!  Awesome service and friendly.  Definitely would eat there again!', '""Breakfast served all day"" is what caught my eye! That\'s hard to come by in an airport  and so is an actual fried egg. The egg  bacon  and cheese sandwich was great and reasonably priced for an airport. Comes with one egg on it. The service was pleasant.', 'Very good breakfast  veggie omelette for the price. Not at all priced like airport food. Good quantity and quality', 'In an airport I always expect mediocre food  the food here was surprisingly on point. Everything was fresh serving size was perfect the guys at the counter were great!', 'During the recent Yelp scavenger hunt event my husband and I got to this place as one of the last venues. We were pretty full from eating elsewhere but told them if they would bag our sample we would eat it at home. They were more than happy to do this for us.\n\nI asked them as far as other locations were concerned. This is the only one in the city and it is Greek themed. When we finally were able to have our ""doggie bag"" I was pleased that they gave us a small gyro which is one of their specialties  along with lemon chicken soup  and oyster crackers. Believe me it did not disappoint. It was just enough for a light meal later.\n\nThey have a rewards program that if you buy 7 sandwiches or salads then you get the 8th one free. When i got home I had a chance to review the menu in detail. the serve a vegetarian gyro  specialty burgers and specialty sandwiches along with sides. Everything is ala carte however  you can get a side of fries and coleslaw at a reduced price if you order a sandwich.\n\nBreakfast items are available as well which does includes omelettes  breakfast sandwiches  pancakes  French toast  and two eggs your way. Expect to pay a little more since you are at the airport but they are on par with some of neighborhood diners I have visited. \n\nSince it is part of the fast casual approach don\'t expect table service however  there is a food court eating area behind the row of fast food eateries on the left side of the center core.\n\nThey do offer egg white substitutes if you have health issues. The only thing I found lacking on their menu was desserts. All they offer is rice pudding. Don\'t expect to see those gigantic pies and cakes you would normally find.\n\nStill they have a good variety of Greek fare selections which is a novel approach to casual dining whether you plan to eat there or take it with you in flight.\n\nNow that non passengers can visit the airside terminal during weekdays only this place is a must return for me next time I find myself out that way.', 'My son and I stopped for a leisurely meal before getting on our flight. Looked like a cute diner theme; too bad everything tasted like old grease. Perhaps they should clean their grill more than once a week.', ""I stopped by here earlier today with my wife for dinner.  We had both been past marathon diner before and never thought much of it.  As a matter of a fact I was avoiding it  not for any particular reason.  So why did I come here you ask?  Well we had a Yelp elite event at the airport and their food was actually quite good and so I decided to stop on my next personal trip.  Since it's located in the airport there isn't too much to say about it other than it's a counter in the center core.  They serve breakfast all day long and I believe their name is Marathon in order to reference their Greek roots.\n\nFor dinner on this day my wife and I both decided to get gyros with fries.  After about a five minute wait our food was ready.  The first thing that I tasted were our fries which were quite good.  They were piping hot and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Next up was the gyro which seemed wet and quite messy.  As a matter of a fact I didn't even try to pick it up with my hands and ate it with a fork from the start.  The gyro meat inside of it was good and there was a good amount of it.  It had vegetables of lettuce  tomato and onion which gave it color and made it feel healthier.  Last but certainly not least was the tzatziki sauce which tasted good but seemed rather watery.  It was bad enough that I debated about whether or not to eat the pita.  Since I was hungry  I did but a soggy pita isn't that great.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  Minus the soggy pita  I enjoyed everything that I had here and my wife did as well."", ""This is my second visit in a month and haven't been disappointed. It's a diner  it has good food  fair price and attitude. Would much rather have a made to order breakfast as opposed to fast food that's been sitting. Coffee was good and they use local vendors."", ""I'm betting this is a very underestimated restaurant at the airport.  It was my first time at the airport  and with a few hours to spare I knew I had to eat dinner somewhere.  In looking around at the usual chains and types of eateries  I nearly overlooked this place.  A 'diner' is not somewhere I would typically choose to eat at.  In looking at the long line at Chick-fil-A and the carb overload of the pizza place next door  a small sign for the veggie gyro at this diner caught my eye.  I love gyros  but since I only eat grass-fed or organic meats  I haven't had a gyro out in years.  A veggie gyro option? It never even occurred to me. No one was in line  and I nearly second guessed whether I should order or keep looking.  he counter worker smiled so I went ahead and gave it a try.  It was DELICIOUS!  All the sauteed veggies  feta cheese  and a great cucumber dressing melded together on a fresh Mediterranean naan bread was the perfect mixture. I think I could go back to the airport just to get this gyro!  I can't say whether the rest of the menu is just as wonderful  but I would highly recommend this gyro specifically.  And if I were the owners  I think I would definitely aim some heavier marketing of this menu item since many people in the airport are looking for something a little more 'healthier' and/or vegetarian  and this is a pretty decent choice to meet that criteria.  A+ rating for my gyro today!"", ""If you're at the Pittsburgh airport don't pass this place by! Not your average airport food. Had the big fat greek omlete  didn't think tzatziki would be good on an omlete but it was fantastic!"", ""I love the food here! It's an option at the airport that I am wish more airports would consider. Their egg sandwiches are terrific and the service is always delivered with a smile. I stop by every time I'm passing through  without fail - and will continue to do so!"", 'This is a prime airport location with the opportunity to be the place to go. I came here because the lines at the other breakfast places (Chick Fil A and McDs) were really long and I wanted to try something new. Now I know why the lines at the other places were long. I experienced unfriendly service and the breakfast sandwich was quite disappointing.', ""Gyro and loaded fries: absolute satisfying. Lots of meat  packed with veggies and the fries are looked and tasted just like diner garbage fries ought to:crispy and greasy  cheese wiz  and bits of real bacon. It's probably going to wow your taste buds like a 4 star sit down resto nut boy did it hit the spot. It's a little slower service compared to other fast food."", 'My ""breakfast sandwich"" was a pathetic excuse for a sandwich. It was the smallest piece of bread I have ever seen! I paid 10 dollars for a sandwich that I could fit into my whole mouth in one bite. The home fries are one of the worst things I\'ve ever tasted too. I confronted the manager about my sandwich  or lack there of  and he could not do anything to accommodate me. I\'m still hungry  pissed off  and just lost 10 dollars. Do not eat here if you are hungry or want a quality meal!!', 'When I spent the night in the Pittsburgh Airport  I was very hungry. On a search for food at 3 in the morning  I found the Marathon Diner  and the manager cleaning off the griddle. Upon walking up  the manager said ""Hey  give me 15 minutes. Want a coffee or juice while you\'re waiting?"" I took an orange juice and sat down. 15 minutes later  him and his staff were cooking up a full breakfast of French toast and eggs for me. The food was outstanding  especially for that early in the morning. More so than the quality of the food  the quality of the people really helped make the experience special. Being met with kindness and care from the staff  a free drink  and a friendly conversation with the manager  truly lifted my spirits that morning. If I ever find myself back in Pennsylvania  you can surely count on me visiting this place again  because it was well worth the overnight stay.', 'Frequent traveler and these folks do the basics really well. Best place for an eggs and bacon breakfast in the airport.', ""On my layover and decided on Marathon Diner! I didn't have time for sit down so chose this over Chick-Fil-A and pizza. The vegetarian gyro was yummy and a healthy option compared to the others. I opted for slaw over the fries but regretted it because I didn't love the slaw. It is a vinegar base but just seemed flavorless. \n\nThey serve breakfast all day! This is fantastic!"", 'Real food! Friendly staff! I had the 2 egg breakfast. Everything was cooked well and hot. Large portions. \nI have a food sensitivity  and the man who waited on me was kind and helpful.', ""I went here as part of a food tasting event. I got to try the lamb gyro  as well as the Greek lemon chicken soup.\n\nThe gyro was absolutely delicious. The pita was warmed and the lamb was fresh  flavorful  and not greasy at all.  The gyro had the perfect amount of toppings (lettuce  tomato  onion) and the tzatziki sauce was delicious - it was definitely homemade  creamy and tangy  with lots of dill for flavor.  The gyro was proportioned very well  where you could get a little bit of everything in each bite!\n\nThe lemon chicken soup was something I've never had before so it was a kick to the face in flavor that I wasn't expecting. It is very tangy  just shy of sour  with perfectly cooked orzo  small bits of chicken  and a flavorful chicken broth that was a bit thicker than your standard chicken soup. It was served with oyster crackers which I didn't use because the soup was delicious on its own and didn't need them. I will definitely look for lemon chicken soup on the menu the next time I visit a Greek establishment!\n\nThe items I got to try were cooked to order  flavorful  and comforting.  I was very impressed with the quality of each and every ingredient and the elevated taste of a standard gyro  without the guilt. Marathon Diner is definitely a solid choice for those wanting some quick comfort food at an affordable price. I will absolutely be back for another gyro the next time I am Pittsburgh International Airport - check it out!"", ""Excellent! I wasn't in the mood for anything overly processed or carb-overloaded (ie. McDonald's  Dunkin' Donuts  ...you know the usual early airport grab and go kind of thing). I spotted the Marathon Diner and was impressed that they had made-to-order eggs. I stepped up in line and was pleasantly greeted by the man at the register...he even cracked a few jokes and made me laugh and it was 4:30 am (hard to do when I'm not a morning person). The food was fantastic! So fresh  hot and perfectly made. The potatoes were piping hot  the toast was so fresh and the eggs were cooked just how I wanted them! Bravo  Marathon!! You made my whole morning! Definitely check this place out!!"", ""This diner is a great place to go in the Pitt airport if you've got time to spare. The food is always delicious and it never fails to satisfy me. The two egg breakfast is my favorite thing to get and I'd highly recommend it because you get a lot of food for not too high of a price. Definitely would recommend!"", ""This was a great find in the Pittsburgh Airport. And early in the morning open with a great set of breakfast offerings and coffee( including decaf). Greek coffee too as one of their specialties.\nIf you are in this airport  take advantage of the friendliness  tasty and fast food and unique offerings. Don't just go anywhere  go the Marathon  it's not as far away as you think. ;)"", ""It's rare for me to review an airport restaurant experience.  However this one deserves it!  So nice to received a happy welcome and omelets made to order!  Yes it's how it should be when it's comes to customer service and so rare to find.  Thank you for helping v to start my day right!"", ""This is an outpost of a local Greek diner in PIT airport. I love to find places like this. \nThe food is made to order on the grill. It's fast but not instant. The gyros and burgers are great. They have a yogurt-based tzatziki sauce for Greek burgers and gyros that's well made. There's a veggie gyro for vegetarians  or if you don't feel like meat. They're both loaded with meat  and a big meal.\nThe sides are good too. The fries are hand-cut and made to order. They give a large packet of Heinz ketchup to go with it. Your meal--fries and all--will be piping hot when you get it. \nThe slaw is a vinegar-based slaw that's tangy and a good companion to a hearty meal. If you don't like that kind of slaw  get something else. Don't expect a sugary mayonnaise-based slaw like you'd get from the local grocery store.\nThey gave me a thick stack of paper napkins. If you're going on a business meeting  put a few on your shirt before you eat. Otherwise  you might need to change your shirt afterwards. It goes with the territory for this kind of meal."", ""These guys do a great job at breakfast starving this morning got their order the ham cheese omelette Delight onion came out fast hot can but you pieces of red home fries. Coffee that was great service was awesome definitely anytime I'm in the airport I'll be stopping off here"", ""My husband and I grabbed a quick dinner here before our flight. He has previously had their Marathon Gyro and was going to repeat that order. I chose the Turkey Club Panini with a side of fries. The food came out in a timely manner. When I opened the box  I was a little disappointed in what I saw. Paninis are typically flattened with nice grill marks. My sandwich was very small with lightly toasted bread  with all of the contents coming out of it. And the fries? Though warmed  they tasted like they were straight from the freezer. My husband enjoyed his gyro.\n\n Maybe this place thrives on making Greek food  but if you're going to spend $10 on an almost less than average sandwich and fries  find another restaurant in the airport."", ""Got a breakfast sandwich from here this morning while waiting on my flight. Ham  cheese  egg  lettuce and tomato. I was expecting a not so good sandwich and I was pleasantly surprised that it was good! I would definitely eat here again to try what's on the menu for lunch/dinner. The workers were friendly and quick. Exactly what you want out of an airport restaurant."", 'Had a chance to try something off their dinner menu today. Ordered a gyro with fries. The gyro was really good and they did not overdo the taziki sauce. The fries were just okay. I will try something else as my side next time.

Seating is open to your preference. Booths are comfy  but limited leg space (tall people problems). The noise level is always calm since it's never packed. Sit on the left side if you want to watch some Tele'Mundo Lol.\nDecorations consist of paintings on walls and some hanging Latin streamers.\n\nAs far as the 4 page menu goes  everything is under $15  there's a wide variety to choose from  and all are very filling. The Fajitas with your choice of any meat always comes out packed with a ton of flavor. I get the shrimp and they never fail to impress this picky gut. Enchilada Style Burritos and Chimichangas are huge! The weird part is  they are the cheapest entrees on the menu too. They do not charge extra if you substitute for steak  only on the shrimp.\nFood doesn't take but 10 minutes to come out  but while you wait  freshly made delicious tortilla chips and salsa are brought out to keep you happy. To tell you the truth  its the biggest reason I keep coming back. :D\nAfter dining in  make sure to stop by next door to their linked bakery for some fresh pastries to take home. So worth your money.\n\nOverall I will have to say from the prices and quality  there's no need for Lindo Michioacan if you reside in the area. Great job  chef!"", ""This has been our favorite neighborhood place for almost 8 years. It is well priced  always good Mexican food.

Large portions  wonderful flavor  decent prices. The bakery was a treat. Amazing prices  great customer service. We are going to return!"", 'My dad always used to tell me that the best Mexican food comes from ""hole in the wall"" places. I wouldn\'t quite call Maria\'s a ""hole in the wall""  but it is a very small Mexican restaurant with some of the best authentic food in town. The attached bakers is also extremely good with low prices.\n\nI came here the first time a few years ago after a friend told me that his daughter  who had moved out of Las Vegas  comes here every time she returns to Vegas to visit. I was hooked from the very first meal. I grew up eating Mexican food in Southern California  and though there are a lot of good restaurants in Las Vegas  Maria\'s stands above most of them.\n\nI don\'t know where to start on the food  as we\'ve never had anything bad here. Everyone we have ever taken here or brought with us loves the food here. The surf and turf burrito (carne asada and shrimp) is just phenomenal. The steak is fantastic  the shrimp is seasoned perfectly  the burrito is huge  and it\'s served wet with a perfect enchilada sauce and melted cheese. I honestly don\'t think there is anyway for this burrito to get better.\n\nThe combo meals are very good to. Choose from enchiladas  tacos  mini-burritos  chili rellenos  etc... You honestly cant go wrong no matter what you order. They have a combo meal that comes with carne asada  an enchilada  a chimichanga and a chili relleno for $18. It\'s a massive meal and enough for two people to share  and everything is high quality.\n\nThe restaurant is very small  with only about a dozen tables and only one server working. Despite how good this place is  it never seems to be packed  so we always get very good service.\n\nThe Bakery is right next door to the dining area. The Mexican pastries are very good  and they are dirt cheap. I love their pineapple pastries and macaroons in particular  though most of the other items are good to. The only thing I really don\'t care for is their cookies  which are very large but crumbly and dry. If you like dryer cookies (and some people do  my wife always gets a peanut butter cookie every time we are here) then you will probably love these. Nothing wrong with their flavor  but I\'ll take moist and chewy cookies over crumbly and dry any day.\n\nIn my opinion  this place is a hidden gem that is well worth trying. If you are a fan of Mexican food  then I would try to make it here some day.', ""We enjoy eating at this Mexican Restaurant a couple of times a month.  You are served Hot Giant Tortilla Chips with Fresh Tasty Salsa before every meal.  I've tried several dishes but one of my favorites is the Chile Verde.

I don't miss Vegas  I miss this restaurant.\n\nI had a few coworkers who feel the way I do. First  the salsa. Perfect. We'd finish at least two bowls and take it to go  too. Garlicky  cilantro heaven. Unlike any other salsa. Beans and rice? Pretty standard  but somehow tasted better on my go-to shrimp taco plate. Flour tortillas  please!

And yet  nowhere makes it taste like this!\n\nService is always phenomenal. Over the years there were a few different waitresses  most of them remembering my order.

I think I counted eight tables so if you plan to come with a larger party call in advance to make sure there is space.

The Tampiquena was great!  A perfectly marinated flap steak with enchilada  beans  rice  salsa  and guacamole.  The Spicy Devil Chicken was alright.

Inside  Mama Maria's is a cute  clean little mom 'n pop type of place.  The server greeted us right away and brought us tortillas and salsa.  I say tortillas because they really are tortillas  not chips.  The salsa is  quite frankly  the best I've ever had.  Having lived in west Texas for a couple of years  I have tried a LOOOOOOT of salsas.  I can say that this is the best I have personally experienced.\n\nThe beans and rice here are fab.  I got the tampiquena.  The steak was tender and well-seasoned.  I was impressed with the cheese enchilada - I normally find enchiladas (especially cheese ones) really boring  but this one wasn't.

The bean dip is a great pairing to it  but really the red stuff is all you need. I mean with all the veggies  could one live on salsa alone? If yes  this is the stuff you want to choose.

The place was small put the services as fast and friendly."", 'Mama Maria\'s Mexican restaurant was a fun place for me to try because it\'s decently close to where I live. My family and I ordered for takeout  which was very convenient. One thing to note is that we participate in the season of Lent  so we had to avoid beef and poultry. Seafood and eggs are fine for us to have eaten.\n\nI commend this restaurant on really good service. They had a busy restaurant  but were able to have our takeout order ready on time and neatly packed  which was much appreciated.\n\nWe ordered guacamole  Chilles Relleno  garlic butter shrimp  shrimp fajitas  and crispy shrimp tacos.\n\nOur order came with chips and salsa! Like everybody has pointed out  the chips come in the form of freshly fried tortillas that you break into tinier pieces. The salsa was delicious! The tomato sauce in it interestingly had a ""pasta sauce"" flavor  which for me  set it apart from any other Mexican salsa I\'ve ever tried. They sent us home with a bunch too  so I was very happy!\n\nWe also ate the chips with the guacamole we ordered. It was good and fresh guac  but it seemed plain for my taste.\n\nWe didn\'t care for the shrimp fajitas or the butter garlic shrimp too much  not very special. The crispy shrimp tacos were a big bust in my opinion because I expected deep fried  breaded shrimp and I thought that was what the menu meant when they said ""crispy""  but apparently that description was only referring to the taco shell  which I cancelled out when I asked to have my tacos wrapped in a flour tortilla instead. Furthermore  nothing had sour cream or crema  which was odd to me. I guess I just didn\'t realize I had to order it separately.\n\nThe Chilles Relleno was SUPERB. My dad and I were so impressed by how tasty this dish came out! If you ever visit this restaurant  that is certainly the dish to try. It was spongy from the egg  but also satisfyingly saucy at the same time. There was a lot of good flavor to it  too. The portion size was another thing I was happy with also.\n\nOverall  I wouldn\'t look forward to ordering anything but the Chilles Relleno.

They always play good spanish music too. \n\nThe food  in my opinion is alright. Good but not amazing. I've tried different things. The mole was not good at all  I'm sorry. I wouldn't order it again.

It\'s located on (6055) East Lake Mead and sets in a little strip mall on the south side of the road.  I would label this restaurant as a Mom & Pop type place. It\'s small  clean  and the wait staff is very accommodating.  The decor is a little dated with murals on the walls and christmas type lights strung across the ceiling.  I was hungry for refried beans and rice and my waiter Christian  suggested a dish with shredded beef  and my plate had a large portion of refried beans and rice as what I was hungry for.  I was served (immediately with)  salsa and fresh warm (4 flat) tortilla like ""chips"" that were good. The shredded beef was good and not overly seasoned  as was the rest of the meal.  I probably wouldn\'t drive across town just to eat at Mama Maria\'s but if I was in the area  I would defiinetly eat there when I was hungry for Mexican Food.  My order came to just under $9 with free refill on my drink order as I had ordered extra beans and rice  I felt the price was reasonable and the food was satisfying.', 'This local business is phenomenal!  It has never disappointed us!  The flautas   chips and salsa  and far too much to mention!  My family has enjoyed this family business for many many years !  Never a complaint!', ""We took the 14 . 7 mile drive from the south end of the strip to this restaurant because of the good yelp reviews  we were a little surprised to find it is actually a small 8-9 table restaurant attached to a Panadaria (bakery )  but it looked nice enough and so we went on in  there were only a couple other patrons  and our waitress quickly cleaned off a table for us and we sat down  she soon returned with chips and salsa. The basket of chips was actually 5 whole deep fried corn tortillas and the salsa was very tasty  medium to spicy with fresh cilantro. Within a short 5-7 minute wait our plates arrived. I had the chicken burrito enchilada style with verde sauce. It was garnished with guacamole  sour cream and pico de gallo. The burro was good sized  the chicken was large pieces of white meat and fairly flavorful  the burro also had refried beans and overall was decent  but kinda dry. My meal was certainly not bad  and the chili verde sauce was homemade and above average. But the entire plate came to the table only warm  not hot like many times is the custom with Mexican food dishes  where the server has to use a hot pad to bring it  within a couple minutes it seemed cold. I inquired about the quality of the other meal and the report was about the same as mine  the food was barely warm  the sauce above average but the  shredded beef was the canned variety and while acceptable certainly not like slow roasted  simmered in spices and cooked to perfection! Overall we rate this place 4  stars. The service was good  our server appeared to be working the dining room alone and was efficient and attentive. The salsa fresh and flavorful. The sauces above average. Probably a very nice neighborhood restaurant  driving here from the strip  we probably passed by quite a few better Mexican food options and probably won't be back  but we will make a stop at Luv-It frozen custard and cleanse our palates with a delicious frozen treat! Adios Maria!"", ""My first time here with my girl and I've gotta say  I have not been truly satisfied with a Mexican restaurant since I've been introduced to real authentic Mexican food at my friends places as I was growing up. This place most definitely brought back memories! \n\nTo start off  anybody who's been here will know how amazing their salsa is. It's not extremely spicy and some people will judge by that but what I look for in a good salsa are the undertones and richness in flavor. IT'S GOOD. Normally when you come to a restaurant like this  you get chips with your salsa. I love that they bring out these warm  flaky  crispy  lightly salted and fried tortillas. Just a tasty little treat before we even ordered. \n\nThe Horchata tastes great! As I've said  it's hard to please me when it comes to restaurants because people like to take shortcuts and make close to real Horchata. It is a very simple drink but you have to get it right. Here it just has the right amount of sweetness  (making up words now) cinnamony and milky taste.\n\nAlready impressed with the pre game they have going on here so I was ready to order. We started off with the Fiesta Plate appetizer and it was awesome. It had quesadillas  nachos  chicken taquitos and chicken strips. Ok so the fried chicken strips are a little out there in authenticity but they tastes good. Everything on this platter was good but I really enjoyed the taquitos! So bomb with the lettuce  beans  sour cream and guac that came with it. My girl and I shared this plate and were already pretty full so it's a good sized plate. I'd say it's great for couples or groups of 3-4. \n\nSo if you really know  burritos are not an authentic Mexican dish. Just throwin that out there! But the way this Enchilada style / wet burrito came out tasted just the way my friends mothers would make them. The plate came garnished with sour cream  guacamole and lettuce. The burrito sat there in a glorious pool of red sauce and melted cheese. Long story short  it was perfecto. Once you undress this little beauty you find this moist rice  beans and well seasoned asada steak. \n\nLeaving this place stuffed for a great price. Plus the service was awesome.

The only complaint I really have is the chips are not really chips  but tostadas.  The salsa was good  not heavy on the tomatoes and they don\'t give you a bean dip.  Other than that  I really enjoyed the food.  Really  it prevents you from going heavy on the tostadas and spoiling your appetite.\n\nI had the chicken enchiladas and they serve three nicely sized enchiladas for a reasonable price; they were ""money!""  In other words  they tasted really good and I\'m picky when it comes to Mexican food.  I dined with some of my co-workers and they all enjoyed their food.  For the people that order the Burrito  it is huge!!!\n\nThe only draw-back is the side of town it is on  but the strip mall where it\'s located didn\'t seem shady.

We sat down at a booth  the waitress came over and asked what we wanted to drink  and then we asked her if the air conditioner was on. She proceeded to tell us that it was broken (by the way  the temperature outside was 108). Inside it had to be 100 degrees without exaggeration. She brought back the drinks and the chips and we considered at that point that we might just leave. Even the other guests were mentioning how stifling the heat was.\n\nHOWEVER- after trying the chips and the salsa  we knew the food would be worth staying for. We ordered a cheese quesadilla and a steak chimichanga  and needless to say  it was FANTASTIC! I'm not a huge fan of Mexican  but the chimichanga was absolutely delicious: the steak was tender and the tortilla was fried perfectly! We ended up eating for under $20 without tip. \n\nThe service was mediocre  but the food was fantastic. Even though there were flaws in our experience  great food will always bring us back!

Priced well  good service."", ""I've been to this restaurant several times. It's normally great and I have good things to say about the place. The food is good and the service is decent. It seems to be one cook and one waitress. Same lady every time. I appreciate the hard working people. Since they are understaffed during busy times they get behind and cause a long wait. And busy could mean about 5 parties. It's a small place. Overall it's a good little Mexican place to eat at.\n\nI always get the shrimp cocktail and my gf always gets a burrito or chimichanga and both are good.\n\nI'd recommend it to anyone looking for a nice little Mexican restaurant. Just don't expect extra great service. The lady is a little quiet and I've had moments where she gets bothered. But I wouldn't say bad service.

This place would become a weekly staple if only it weren't about 30 miles round-trip for me.\n\nWe had the enchilada verde special on the chalk board: about $9 for three enchiladas in green sauce with beans and rice. Meal came with fried tortillas to break into chips  and some fresh red salsa. Everything tastes authentic without melting our gringo tastebuds.\n\nWater was clean  server was nice  music was pleasant. Food reminded me of a place that I grew up with back in SoCal and pined for when I moved out to the valley a decade ago. It took a long time to find this  and I am sad to spend like $5 in gas just to make a trip out here  but it's worth it."", ""Along with the fact that I've had a bad experience here before with the waitress and the problem of the sewage smell coming through the door upon walking in  I am absolutely appalled by the service that I received today by waitress named Gloria. I received very bad service from her before but because the food here is decent I figured I would give her another chance and thought that she just had a bad day. Upon walking in  I sit down and she takes my order and does not even ask me if I want anything to drink (let alone even offer the option for chips and salsa). She immediately sits down and gets on her phone and starts chatting and laughing and I asked her if I can get some water along with having the free salsa and chips that is normally offered. She told me that they charged for the second round of chips and salsa and the first one is free if you eat in the restaurant. She assumed that I was going to take the food to go which puzzled me as to why she never even asked in the first place whether or not I was going to take the food and immediately took it upon herself to charge me. Already feeling irritated with her service  I asked for her manager and she gave me the name of her manager along with the days that he worked. She also stated her name to me in a very rude way and then turned around to complete what she was doing in the kitchen along with canceling my order.\n\nThe reason why I come to this place is because the food is good and they're close to my area of residence yet because of that  it still does not give anyone a reason to treat their customers with a lack of service. I've spoken to the manager before and he seems like a very nice guy who would rectify the situation but I'm just hoping that in the future management would be more aware of how  their waitresses treat their customers. \n\nBeing in Las Vegas there are SO many Mexican restaurants in the city I believe it would behoove any Mexican restaurant owner or business to make sure that they are a cut above the rest due to the high competition. \n\nThe only reason why I gave them two stars is because the food is decent  although the last time when she brought the chips out they were oily and cold. I asked Ms Gloria to reheat them and this is where the attitude started with me. I've been eating there in the past two years and never have I had any issues with the service. \n\nIn this case  Ms. Gloria you really left a bad taste in my mouth and I don't think I'll be coming back to this restaurant anytime soon!"", 'My boyfriend and I just moved to Vegas from San Diego and this place is right down the street from us. We love Mexican food and this has got to be one of the best we have ever had. The prices are incredibly reasonable  the food is so so delicious  and the quick and friendly. My favorite are the Enchiladas with chilli verde sauce. For that matter anything with the verde sauce is good. They have good mole sauce too. Only tiny tiny issue for us is that we are night owls and have tried to go close closing time and it seems as if they close a little earlier than 9 sometimes. Having been worked in food service for ages  and given that they are a family run restaurant I totally understand  but just a heads up for anyone else thinking of going towards closing time.', 'Amazing food and service.

The flavors were authentic  and everything was perfectly fresh.\n\nI picked up some tacos to take out on the other side of the business.  I was less excited about those.

Oh  and a large order of guac to share. The tostadas and salsa were good  I liked that they were thin like tortilla chips. The guac was ok. I like mine to be a bit on the chunky side. This one was more smooth but still had good flavor. We usually finish the bowl but didn't here. Our food arrived shortly after and it looked great. I asked for no sour cream or cheese and corn tortillas with my chili verde and it arrived with cheese and zero tortillas. The other order of chili verde didn't receive the flour tortillas either. I made due and ate around the cheese- the beans and rice were delicious  as was the chili verde. It had awesome flavor and spice. The fries and wings were sub-par but it's not really a place known for that  so I let it slide a bit. The enchiladas verde and tampequena got great reviews from the others.\n\nI wouldn't mind coming back if we are on the Eastside and in the mood  but I will not drive out of my way for it."", 'We have eaten at Mama Maria\'s often and USUALLY get great service.

I went Saturday at lunch and it was busy  and there was a steady flow of customers.  The problem was there was only one waitress.  She was efficient  but obviously the service wasn't as good as it should be.  The family had carnitas  minichangas  and a chimichanga.  All were very tasty  and the price was very fair.  Because there was only one server  the later guests had to clean their own tables.  I also used the bathroom after eating  and it was about as clean as a gas station bathroom.  Must be something close to authentic as we were the only gringos in the place.  I'd give the food five stars  but service and cleanliness need to be improved."", ""By far the best Mexican Restaurant I've been to!

It took seemingly ages to get chips and salsa  with two other tables that came in after us getting chips ahead of us. The food was ok  but nowhere near the quality of our last visits. Then we couldn't get our check and after waiting for about 15 minutes  we finally gave up and went to the counter to get our check  which still hadn't been done  and pay.

A friend was visiting from Hawaii where they have no Mexican restaurants and was craving some so we tried this place and it was awesome! Kind of a small place  not really made for big groups but still awesome. We got the enchiladas verde and enchiladas Guadalajara and both a chicken and beef tamale. Extremely delicious. And the MICHELADA WAS PERFECT. Both of them lol I don't get to east side often but I would definitely recommend this place!"", ""Service was rotten. Didn't get chips till after the dinner was served. Chips were actually more like fried corn tortillas. There was only one server taking care of the entire restaurant. Ordered water but it never came. Girlfriend ordered a chili relleno and it was excellent.  I had the shrimp tacos. The plate was just covered with lettuce and tomatoes but once I got my bearings this too was delicious. Rice and beans were ok but the guacamole was delicious too and a very generous portion I might add. When the check finally came we found we were overcharged. There was a discrepancy in the price presented on the menu and the price that was on our ticket for the plate we ordered. I don't think that is ever happened to me ever at a restaurant before but since it was a small discrepancy we paid and left. If this establishment would step it up on the service and honor prices on their menu it is well worth the trip. One last thing before I go  we looked at the menu online and the menu in the restaurant did not have the same items  little weird."", ""Excellent food. Tastes very genuine and the portions are good. The shrimp burrito is the best I've ever had with a distinct sea flavor on the rice and generous on shrimp. The beef burrito is also good but less distinct from others I've had before.\nThere's 2 options for aguas frescas  jamaica and horchata. None is homemade.\nOverall 5 stars  for the great food taste and the relaxed mexican decor and feeling."", ""I tried Maria's with a group from work after hearing a recommendation from a friend.

Everything was served hot and fresh and I was very content after the meal.  My colleagues had the Cameron's a la Diabla and the Taco Plate.  Everything looked great and there weren't any complaints.  The restaurant has an at-home feel  amplified by having a connected and associated bakery right next door.\n\nThe restaurant is located in a store front  so parking might get tight now and then.

I asked to see the tix and it matched our order  so WTH?  Began to question it  got nowhere  and was embarrassed since I was paying the check and thought I looked cheap.

Steak/chicken fajitas on point and ice-ice baby cold mugs for the beer - Yummy  as you can see by the pic!  Cheese quesadilla is even good and the salsa/fried tortillas are the best!!', ""If you are willing to drive distances to try out a great hole in the wall  then put Mama Maria's on your list of places to try. Someone told me about this place a few weeks ago and have been wanting to go since. We finally made the trip way out to the Northeast and were rewarded with fantastic food  reasonable prices  and friendly service. \n\nAfter debating between several items  we decided to order the chile verde  enchiladas verdes  and a chile relleno a la carte. The chile verde ($8.50) consisted of tender pieces of slow cooked pork bathed in a tangy tomatillo sauce  and was served with a side of fluffy rice and refried beans that tasted identical to those we had at a little lobster village in Mexico. The pork was fork tender and I loved the large meaty chunks  but I would have preferred it to have a few more hot chiles. The chile relleno ($5.50 a la carte) was also worth the trip and we even thought it was better than that of Vega's cafe  which previously held our number one spot for this dish. Rather than a white sauce  this was served with a perfectly executed red tomato-based sauce. The batter was thicker and had a good amount of egg  and there wasn't a superfluous amount of cheese in the center. The combination of these two factors pleased me because it resulted in more protein  less fat  and a more interesting flavor combination. It just felt like a more balanced dish than the other chile rellenos I've had. The enchiladas verdes ($8.99) were the least impressive dish  but still better than enchiladas at most other restaurants. I appreciated how the green sauce for these was different than the chile verde sauce used for the pork  because it showed me that each dish is thought of independently. My husband commented on the skill used to prepare the sauces here as they weren't broken (culinary term meaning the fat and acids haven't separated from one another)  and I agreed. Even though the food here could be equated with awesome home cooking  the skill level necessary to prepare each of these is probably underrated in the eyes of the consumer. I really wanted the tres leches cake since that is on my top five list of favorite desserts (the best I've had is at Cuba Cuba in Richmond  VA)  but sadly they were out so we settled for the flan ($2.50). This turned out not to be sad at all  because despite the weird presentation with plastic covered toothpicks  the flan itself was creamy and the caramelized sugar syrup was toasty and rich. Plus  it was the perfect size. If you don't want to try the desserts here  however  you can go to the shop next door to get homemade ice creams and popsicles  which are also inexpensive.\n\nThough I've only been once  it seems like the food here would be fairly consistent since it's run by a couple from Guadalajara who manage the restaurant and do all the cooking  just like at Vega's cafe. Adding to the charm is the old fashioned diner wheel system for reading restaurant tickets  a refreshing sight in a country whose restaurants are filled with P.O.S (point of sale) systems. Plus  it's always great to support a Mom and Pop kind of place!"", ""I am so thrilled to have found this restaurant. I went without looking at any rating and boy was a surprised with this little  hole in the wall  blink and you miss it eatery. We are broke like most are and there has been a natural gas crew working in our neighborhood so our gas was for cooking was all but cut off  so we decided to try this little Mexican restaurant we had a 2 for 1 entree coupon for. We both had the carnitas and a margarita each. The salsa and chips were warm and FABULOUS  the carnitas were perfectly seasoned with crispy edges/bits and the margaritas were pretty good. All in all it was a delicious meal with fast friendly service. I do recommend it highly  and we will be going back. \n\n2 entrees + 2 margaritas = $ 9.36\n\nCAN'T BE BEAT - YUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMY !!!"", ""México lindo y querido  si muero lejos de ti  que mi última cena sea aquí.\n\nTranslation: Beautiful and beloved Mexico  if I die far from you  let my last meal be here.\n\nSeriously  that's how I felt when I had lunch here a few days ago.  And I *know* authentic  good Mexican food; I grew up in West Texas minutes from the border with Mexico  my mother is full-blooded Mexican  and I was actually born in Mexico.  \n\nI drove across the city (literally across the city  this place is on Lake Mead and Mt Hood and I drove from Sahara and 215) just to try this place out.  Full disclosure: I went to college with the current owner (the parents are the ones that opened this place up years ago).\n\nI'd been looking for a place that served good menudo  and I'd asked friends of mine and I was directed here.  Hmm ok  regardless if I know you or not  I am going to let you know my honest opinion on it  and if it sucks  it sucks  friendship be damned.  \n\nIt doesn't suck at all.  The menudo is so good!  It's not greasy or oily in the least  the chile is just the right level of caliente  the hominy is tender  and the tripe is clean and not-chewy.  And it's served with dried oregano  lime  chopped onions  chile flakes  and cilantro  so you can garnish at your preference.  A little oregano  a few onions  and some lime juice and my menudo was ready to go.  So  so good!  And probably would have cured any hangover.  \n\nBut I get ahead of myself.  This place is very much a hole-in-the-wall  cozy like your abuela's kitchen type place.  Maybe not your abuela but like mine for sure.  There's no pretentiousness at all  and my friend and I were welcomed to take a seat where we liked.  After being seated  drink orders were taken (just water thanks!)  and then homemade chips (really they're fried tortillas that you break) and homemade red salsa (happy medium between chunky and smooth).  \n\nSo my friend is more reserved and orders the chicken taquitos as an appetizer (while I had my super-tasty menudo) which she enjoyed.  I had one with some guacomole and the guacamole was fresh.  She then ordered a chicken taco plate  which she thoroughly enjoyed  though I can't judge because I was preoccupied with my meal.\n\nI ordered chile verde.  Super tender pork simmering in a green sauce (tomatillo base) for hours  served with a side of yellow rice and refried beans.  The sauce... so  so good.  Now the chips and salsa and the menudo had me pretty full and I was sure that I would only be able to take a few bites of the chile verde and the rest would have to go in a take-home container.  No  no  the chile verde sauce said no  you will enjoy every last tasty morsel here... and it was right. \n\nThe server was very attentive and my water glass was never empty.  The music in the background was mariachi and norteno  so yes  it supported the authenticity.  Price-wise  unbelievably reasonable for the meal my friend and I had here.  \n\nNow  I traveled across the city already for some tasty  authentic Mexican food  and I was not leaving without some tasty  authentic Mexican pastries.  To the panadería next door!  I take a half-dozen with me for a very reasonable price and I've been enjoying them at home since my visit.  I'm down to my last pineapple empanada  so I may have to trek across the city sooner than later.  \n\nIf you want truly authentic Mexican food full of flavor at very reasonable prices and served by friendly people  go here.

Food arrives and our plates looked great! I cut into the enchilada and to my surprise  it looked like chicken from a can. I had never seen that before.

This one was better than the one I had two years ago. That's for sure. They're doing proper shaved ice now. The milky kind.

They put the matcha powder in with the milk mix  so the shaved ice was actually matcha flavored. They then put a good amount of red beans and condensed milk on top  then added a few bits of mochi. Without the condensed milk  it could have been a bit sweeter  but with it  it was just about right.

Tastes on par with Bakery Nakamura  in my honest opinion. \n\nMy wife and I got the 27 inch Sweet Potatoes Cake. The cake is light  fluffy  not too sweet and they use real sweet potatoes.  I wanted to eat the whole cake but my wife got a hold of myself. Just look at it. They designed it pretty cute too.

It is its own store though  and has its own store listing.\n\nI've been waiting a year to try patbingsu here (yeah. One too many k-dramas). They only have it in the summer (seasonal). Patbingsu is shaved ice topped with things like red bean  fruit  condensed milk  etc. Bakery Gateau's comes in three different types (red bean - $7.50  fresh fruit - $8.00  and green tea - $8.00). Yeah. For something I'd like to call a big  glorified  Asian snow cone  it's quite expensive. \n\nI ordered the red bean one (I should have ordered green tea  but I didn't read the menu correctly). I'm not a fan of red bean. After tax  it was about $8.50. It serves about two. The ice is shaved to order. It is then topped with condensed milk (and/or evaporated milk. She put two milky substances in there)  red bean paste (lots of it)  a few spoonfuls of canned fruit  a few fresh blueberries and a few fresh strawberry quarters (washed and cut to order). The red bean paste was quite chunky. It's darker colored than its Chinese counterpart. It's also considerably thicker. It's more bean paste and less bean sauce. What I mean is that this was more of a chunky mashed potato consistency  whereas the Chinese version on shaved ice is usually more whole or half beans in a syrupy consistency. It was slightly difficult to mix together. Taste-wise  it wasn't my favorite thing in the world  but it was definitely not as unpleasant as I thought it was going to be (much less red bean regret than I thought). It was very refreshing. \n\nMaybe I'll come again for their green tea one....if I can wrap my head around the price."", 'I came back here again for cakes. Was looking for NY Cheesecake. Unfortunately it was sold out. I was dying to try it!  I had their Sweet Potato Cakes last time which was a bomb!!!  I like the react that their cakes are not too sweet  fluffy and tasty.  Moreover  I went with 16"" Tiramisu which the staff suggested is one of their popular cakes. They are absolutely right and I can see why it is popular. Simply delicious!', 'this place is absolutely delicious. they have the best korean filled cream buns. its located in a korean grocery store so you can also get korean food !', ""I like! Despite being located inconspicuously in a supermarket  the presentation and taste of the cake was quite good. The sweetness and smoothness of the cream balanced fairly well with the slight bitterness and texture of the sponge base. There wasn't anything to exclaim over in terms of flavour complexity  but the cake definitely looked well made. Prices are reasonable. Service (the little I experienced  since it was just placing and picking up an order) was comfortable and nice.\n\nBonus points for being open all days of the week (so many other bakeries are closed on Monday/Sunday/other random times).""]"

After living in California for a decade acai bowls became the standard grab and go breakfast item. I've never been to Brazil but I feel I have my share of solid tasty acai bowls. Now to my assessment of of Bolt's acai bowl. First I saw them pour a fruit mixture into a cup not blend a fresh array of fruit acai in a blender. Then they proceeded to top of this sludge with a pile fruit to bury this hot mess they called an acai bowl. It was liquid not frozen nor fresh and I definitely will not be going back for one at all. I give this 2 stars solely because they put a very tasty and better than the entire bowl  a coconut whip on top  that was the only good thing. If you're going for the acai please stay away but if you're having their salad bowls I'm sure they're ok as I have never tried them."", ""I came here with my BFF the first time  and it was overall a good experience. I customized my own salad  and the watermelonade that I got was good. My friend and I enjoyed our eats and then came back for the extravagant looking acai bowl. The acai bowl looks like it's going to be the most incredible thing  but is really eye candy  because when you try it  you're like this is alright  but can't help but be a little disappointed because it looks like it's going to be this wonderful explosion of flavour in your mouth. \n\nI came back the next day for the Beet juice  because i tried my friends and really liked it. Later on I came back for the Brazil something smoothie  which for $10  was really lacking. I make way better smoothies at home. On top of that  the girl who made my drink was wearing shorts that exposed her butt cheeks quite substantially  and I couldn't believe she came into work like that and management didn't do anything about it. It honestly turned me away from the place  because no respectful place would allow their workers to dress like that  unless you're in a different industry. So  because I make the same juice myself at home  and my smoothies taste way better  and I don't want to be exposed to random ass cheeks  I will not be back. Bolt management  I hope you're reading this."", 'I\'ve been to Bolt twice now.  It\'s a good spot to grab a quick healthy bite.  The bowl servings are very generous.  Being a meat eater  I was still full after finishing my quinoa bowl.  The downside of this is the salsa mysteriously absorbed into my meal and left it seriously lacking taste.  I had the protein bowl the second time and the dressing + butternut squash give it more flavour - I\'d recommend this if you\'re not making your own.  Although  it still had a very ""carby"" feel to it I often get after eating vegetarian food.  I tried the beet juice which was tasty  but a smallish serving for the price.  The best part about bolt are the acai bowls.  I\'ve had both on the menu  and they are like a healthy dessert  although I question how many calories they have.  That\'s how good they are!\n\nBottom line is a decent  convenient spot to grab a very healthy  quick meal.

I haven't seen the meme grace their social media channels yet  but in due time  I am sure. \n\nI really like Bolt. From the bright interior to the easy-to-read menu  it's not as intimidating a place as one might think. Definitely take a gander at the menu before you go in though because with so much selection  it is hard to not just stand there  mouth agog  while you make your decision. In times of sickness  I have turned to Bolt for supped-up orange juices and health shots from Elxr Juice Lab. In times of health  any old smoothie will do. I especially like the Lemon Tart  which has a little bite to it from the hemp hearts  lemon zest and Royal dates. For the instagrammable showstopper  run don't walk to order an acai parfait and don't skimp on the whipped coconut cream. That's like ordering nachos without guac; it simply isn't done. \n\nThe price point kind of prevents Bolt from being a daily or weekly indulgence  like a latte or muffin from coffee shops down the street. But  you do feel like you're getting what you pay from when you see all the fresh ingredients lined up in a salad box or being churned into a bright drink. \n\n\n#BOLT"", 'Absolutely love how fresh the food is. I had a strawberry  banana smoothie and a ""burrito bowl"". Delicious. Portions are decent and kept me full for a couple of hours. The environment was also welcoming and clean.', 'YES! I have been waiting for a yelp page for BOLT to open up because I have been dying to review the newest addition to my neighbourhood\'s food scene. Surprisingly  there are not a lot of healthy/vegetarian options in WQW so when BOLT opened it was like an angel came down from the heavens above and personally blessed us with this beautiful  special and fantastic local offering.\n\nI have inhaled everything I have ever gotten from BOLT  which almost always consists of a ""my grain"" bowl. My personal favourite is quinoa  kale  beets  carrots  tofu and avocados with the zesty green dressing. If you order this and do not love it then you need to stop trying to convince yourself that you like healthy food. This combination is perfection. Ingredients are always crisp and fresh and the staff is so nice and happy. There is nothing I dislike about this place. They\'re local  support local food  support local companies  and are focused on health and nutrition. It\'s a fantastic spot and I\'m so glad it opened up just down the street from me.

So there you go Bolt  you converted me  and I'm sure you're happy about it. Since then I have ordered the freshly squeezed juice  smoothies (different flavours  and not the one that I previously wrote about that I didn't like  the Lemon something is really really good). And actually  I have developed a taste for the Acai bowls which I have fallen in love with and give me great joy. I even started making them at home (I got the acai smoothie packs they use and I had the other ingredients) along with coconut whipped cream  but something I still like to get them when I'm downtown for work on the weekend (its a 5 min. walk)  and sit outside the restaurant). Last time I went I even shared the oatmeal from the acai bowl with a cute birdie who really enjoyed it (did you know birds like raw oats? now you do). This place is expensive  however  I think some things are justified and some things arent. I picked up a teenie tiny brownie (looked like a half a regular brownie)  for $3  and half a chocolate bar for 6.50  lol. I don't regret it  but it's pricey. For what goes into the acai bowl  I think the price is justified because they use great ingredients. I really think that there's something for everyone here  even if you aren't vegan/gluten free/dairy free/refined sugar free  etc. Bonus points for everything being gluten free here as well. This place is truly unique and offers something different."", ""I've lived in the area my whole life and have gone to Bolt since they first opened  back when their offerings and service were great  but that was years ago. \n\nNow  this place is just awful. They have increased their prices while decreasing the quality of their offerings. The salads/grain bowls are disgusting when you consider that the ingredients are not covered at all and the front door is open sometimes. Their stews and soups are small and not worth their price tag. The parfait is what made this place popular and I don't even like it that much since they switched out the granola mix. \n\nAnother thing to add is the customer service  it can be fine sometimes and awful at others. I was used to seeing the same people work here (back when I visited Bolt every week) but now it seems as if i'm seeing someone new every time I go in there. Are they having trouble keeping staff? \n\nPersonally  If you are looking for an alternative to Bolt and are near the Queen West or Little Portugal area I highly suggest The Goods  Veghed and The Grow-Op. These establishments will all blow Bolt out of the water."", ""I was taking a stroll in the neighborhood with my date and walked in to check this place out. It was the most rewarding spontaneous thing I've done in a while. They had been open only 10 minutes and I was their first customer.

I'll definitely be back to try their salads and smoothies! \n\nNote: Not a sit down restaurant."", ""If I had to meet a missed work deadline after 5p.m. anywhere else on earth  I don't know what I'd be eating!

Finally  it was mentioned that they don't accept the tap function when paying with a card as they should earn tips; the tap function elongates that.

So I opted for an acai bowl because i LOVE acai bowls. The person working there didn\'t seem to know exactly what she was making or doing  but she still managed to pull off a decent acai bowl. Not many places in Toronto offer them  so it was pretty good since you don\'t have much to compare to (unless you make your own at home of course). The acai blend was good  fruit toppings good  granola good. But nothing too spectacular. I will return to try more menu items in the future.', ""Totally great! I made my own grain bowl using quinoa  kimchee  grated carrot  grated squash  tofu and avocado  topped with carrot miso dressing.  It was super good  and with a juice/smoothie  could be split between two people for a decent sized lunch.  I recently tried the Goods on Dundas  and I didn't like it nearly as much as Bolt.

The staff here is super friendly and I didn't get a chance to check out their solid food. What I appreciated most about BFB is their willingness to accommodate dietary needs including my allergens of coconut and almond. Might not seem like a big deal to note; however  many sites use coconut and/or almond milk and don't offer alternatives.\n\nI was very open about it being my first time and they were so kind to walk me through their ordering process and give some insight. They also sell a particular brand of cold-pressed juices which had me craving for more as I left the city.

They have also switched the strawberries for raspberries on one of their acai bowls (sadface - I know it's because strawberries are harder to access etc.  but still sadface)  and also related to the acai bowl they have changed the granola (no longer just oatmeal but also had some seeds in their  dislike...). They also recently started advertising that you can get the coconut whip to go - which is a cool and awesome option that I get sometimes.

The Kale Caesar dressing is quite possibly the best I've had and I love that they threw some chickpeas  avocado  tempeh and grape tomatoes in there to keep things interesting. The coconut whipped cream on the parfaits is super thick and creamy. My only 'beef' with this place is that it's pretty expensive. Also  there's nowhere to sit and eat.

Sorry!"", ""I love the concept of Bolt -- with their offerings of fresh  healthy smoothies  juices and meals -- and even their website  with its bright orange background and round  cheerful font makes me want to be happier and healthier.\n\nUnfortunately  the food didn't make me so happy. I stopped in to try the Protein bowl  a brown rice bowl (somewhat similar to Fresh's bowl offerings) with cherry tomatoes  marinated tofu  sprouts  beans  butternut squash  pepitas and carrot miso dressing. Everything is served to-go  so the components of the bowl were assembled in a takeout container and the dressing is served in a plastic cup within. For $9  the serving is generous -- possibly enough for two full meals  depending on your appetite. I found it to taste overwhelmingly of ginger  although I wasn't quite sure why  and the sauce seemed to disappear completely and be absorbed into the components without adding any enhancement of flavour. The more I ate  the less I liked it  and I couldn't bring myself to finish it even though I still felt hungry. \n\nOn the positive side  the space inside is beautiful  and staff were very friendly. In addition to their menu items they also seem to sell drinks like kombucha  coconut water and some sort of kefir  as well as Chocosol chocolate. There appeared to be a few high-top tables inside  but no chairs  so perhaps not an ideal place to sit and linger. It's a bummer that there aren't any seating options inside  as I feel somewhat strange eating all this healthy food while producing so much unnecessary waste.\n\nI might come back to try one of their juice or smoothie offerings  but I'll skip the grain bowl next time and get my meal elsewhere."", ""I've been following BOLT Fresh Bar on Instagram ever since a friend tagged them in a delicious looking smoothie.

It's unassuming without much flashy signage.  I walked by a few times before deciding to give it a go because the first few times the whirring sounds made me think they exclusively served juices/smoothies. \n\nThe closest competition I can think of is iQ Foods which also has similar packaging and food offerings.\n\nBased on the tips here  I tried two grain bowls: 1) Quinoa Bowl and 2) Vitamin Sea Bowl.\n\nQuinoa Bowl ($10): \nThis bowl contains shredded kale  green onions  parsley  avocado  tomato salsa and cherry tomatoes on a bed of quinoa.  Lots of green popping out when you open the box.  Feels very salad-y and generally quite tasty.  If you like fresh shredded kale then this is for you.  However  while it was good  it didn't have quite the flavour punch I was hoping for.\n\nVitamin Sea Bowl ($9):\nThe Vitamin Sea Bowl was an interesting mix of quinoa  seaweed  carrots  a slice of avocado  a mix of kimchi  red cabbage  sesame seeds and some kelp noodles. There's a separate creamy lemon tahini sauce.  It's an interesting mix of ingredients and certainly feels very light.  The tahini sauce was slightly tart from the lemon but is quite subdued in its flavour.  The kimchi really grew on me; I felt that it was a strange addition early on but the combination of foods really hits that savoury spot.\n\nThe servings are pretty decent  though within expectations given the price. Ingredients are very fresh too.  Would visit regularly."", ""I never post reviews but after my last experience  I need to do so. \nI used to go here quite regularly but last week I went and had a really gross experience. They use their bare hands to prepare the meals - no biggie if they're using utensils to make it  but when they are actually using their fingers to sprinkle stuff on to your bowl its kinda gross. Even grosser when it is the same person who was checking out a customer before and handling their money and then does the same for you. \nI emailed them to let them know of my concerns. No response. I wouldn't have written this review if they had and addressed my concerns but they obviously don't care about their customers.

Now to my assessment of of Bolt's acai bowl. First I saw them pour a fruit mixture into a cup not blend a fresh array of fruit acai in a blender. Then they proceeded to top of this sludge with a pile fruit to bury this hot mess they called an acai bowl. It was liquid not frozen nor fresh and I definitely will not be going back for one at all. I give this 2 stars solely because they put a very tasty and better than the entire bowl  a coconut whip on top  that was the only good thing. If you're going for the acai please stay away but if you're having their salad bowls I'm sure they're ok as I have never tried them."", ""I love their salads and salad dressings and the discount if you're a Float member.\nThe reason I've given 2 stars is the customer service. I've gotten served by a different employee every time I've gone and they've all been miserable. No one who has served me has ever smiled or made eye contact and seems bothered. Tough life."", ""Love this place so much thank goodness it opened near my place. I grab a few smoothies and juices every day before work if I can since my options at work are a joke. Bolt has a super friendly staff  they remember you. Order the high boltage shot. Sometimes it's made slightly different depending on the person  I like it spicy. The greena coolada is excellent and the almond smoothie is pretty god damn amazing. Beet juice is killer and the soups are always always always good. The salad bar is pretty top notch. The red head is a sweetheart and the girl with a half shaved head. Go here if u like healthy."", ""I've been scoping out this place on Instagram pretty much since this place opened. I just moved to the neighborhood and finally had a chance to check it out. So far I've had the Lemon Smoothie and Acai parfait. Both delicious but the price point is insane! 13 dollars for the acai parfait?! The optional coconut whip is 3.25  come on guys  extra guac at Chipotle is cheaper than that (actually a whole burrito is cheaper meal for meal). Pay with debit and they automatically give you the 15/18/20% tip option  even though this is not an eat in place. You have to choose 'other' and then $0.00 not to tip. Sorry but I'm not tipping on something this expensive to begin with!! 3 stars because I can't deny it's yummy but my wallet can't justify me frequenting this place with any regularity."", 'Healthy  but my taste buds didn\'t ""sing"".

Everything in the bowl was fresh and there were just enough toppings so that it wasn't over-bearing. At first it looks like a lot of kelp  but with all the other toppings  I would definitely say that the kelp enhanced the flavour of the bowl as opposed to drowning out all the other flavours.\n\nAs I was watching the guy (I wish I knew his name) prep the bowl  I thought that he must surely be over-portioning the quinoa and all the toppings. Especially because the bowl is only $9. Suffice it to say  the amount that I walked away with was substantial giving the affordable price point - for the quality and amount that I got  I'd say that Bolt is definitely comparable to Live Food Market (but they're honestly a fraction of the price!!).\n\nI'll definitely go back there again. And again."", 'Okay so Bolt is 100% hype and like 30% truth. Yes the vitamin c bowl is pretty good but honestly all of the smoothies are just okay and the other bowls and salads are also just okay. The most irksome thing though is the service  last time I was in I was unaware that the menu had been changed as it was still up where it has always been and I didn\'t see the inconspicuous dry erase board  aka ""the new menu"" in the shadows next to the ""old"" menu  a guy behind the counter asked my order and I began to tell him as the girl working there screams -yes  she lookied me in the eyes and yelled at me  it was very odd  there was a new menu  ""didn\'t I notice the NEW MENU?!"" yeah  it sucked.', ""I've been here a few times due to convenience but have stopped because it's just not worth it.

The soup was great but the nachos were stale and ruined the meal for me. :( I could see the associate digging around so she probably gave me the remnants of the bag when she should have informed me that it wasn't available instead.  \n\nThis experience inspired me to cook more for myself - yeesh!\n\nThe only positive I see is that there's a ton of climate friendly options  which I always appreciate in a place...\n\nWill be a very very slow walk back to try a smoothie or a bowl."", ""I hate giving unfortunate reviews but I feel this one is more a warning as my experience might be a Your Mileage May Vary.  Im not sure what happened or if it was just an off day but the service here seemed genuinely irritated and frustrated at something.\n\nThis is a quick service take out spot.  Though there is some standing room to eat your meal  the rough service makes this spot really unwelcoming and uncomfortable.

It's clean and functional ... nothing really to be knocking it.\n\nAbout the service  I should have taken the death stare upon opening the door as my first hint that I should have turned around.  The tone and physical stance were really more confrontational and it most of the room look at each other with hesitation.

It was overly salty and acidic... and I didnt put on very much onto it either.  The vegetable offering is ok.

I went here for brunch and loved it. Tons of veg and vegan options. And they make a good americano (a must!).\n\nI had the vegan eggs benedict and it was quite good. I would have preferred that it came with potatoes on the side but at least I didn't leave brunch feeling crazy full and sluggish as is usually the case after brunch out on a Sunday.\n\nIt didn't seem that busy for a Sunday brunch  so maybe not too many people know of this place? Such a shame."", 'Let me start by saying that I love this place and am going to have to try to make it out to Bloordale more often!\n\n1st visit: I first visited The Steady Cafe for brunch last fall with a large group (10+? people).  I started off with the Southern Sinner ($9)  which unfortunately took longer than I would have liked to arrive.  But when I tasted it-yum!  It tastes exactly as described (sweet tea  booze  and coconuts).  I\'ve since tried two cocktails and the Southern Sinner is my favourite.\n\nI also ordered the Collard Stuffed Cornbread Waffle with Chipotle Maple Syrup ($13) and added a side of sausage (because I wanted a dose of protein).  One thing that annoyed me a bit was that the menu said that fruit was included on the side but the waitress didn\'t bring it out.  When I asked about it  she thought that I was mistaken but later did bring the fruit out for me once she realized the error.  I appreciate that she was nice about it.  Another downside was that the sausage was sort of bland.  I had high expectations since I believe their sausage is homemade but I didn\'t really enjoy it.  The waffle was really good and very large.\n\nI also ordered the OMG Sugar & Cinnamon Donuts ($6) and I really enjoyed these!  I wished that they were more moist but the coconut cream made up for it!  The cream had a mild coconutty sweetness to it and was at a somewhat cool temp which I really liked.  \n\nOverall  for this visit  the service was slow but to be fair  I was part of a large group.  At least the service was friendly.\n\n2nd visit: I visited again this past New Year\'s Day for brunch in a smaller group. I ordered the Southern Sinner again and found it a bit weaker than what I remembered but tasty nonetheless.\n\nI also ordered the Skillet ($13) this time because I had sampled a friend\'s plate during my first visit and remember wishing that I had ordered it instead of the waffle!  The Skillet didn\'t disappoint - a nice mishmash of spinach  sausage  tomatoes  eggs  cheese atop hashbrowns brought out in a piping hot skillet!  This definitely gives alot of bang for your buck because it\'s tasty  hearty  and very filling.  I was also pleased because the sausage was more flavourful than last time.  Perhaps it\'s just that there was enough salt this time. Still it was a huge improvement.\n\nService was friendly as usual  which was more impressive considering our server had worked late the night before for New Year\'s Eve!\n\n3rd visit: I recently went with a friend to try the new dinner menu which is VERY well-priced.  I made a change from my usual Southern Sinner and went with the Forbidden Fruit ($10) to start.  It\'s not my favourite - I found it to be bland.  Next time  I plan to try the Dirty Jolene (with donut liquer!) or I can go with ol\' reliable - the Southern Sinner.\n\nFor my main  I started out with the Enchiladas ($6). I LOVED these!  There were 3 smallish chicken enchiladas with a side of cumin sour cream.  I would say that they were mildly spiced but still very tasty.  I loved the seasoning of the chicken and the cumin sour cream took it over the top for me!  I have never thought of ""spiking"" sour cream with cumin but I may give it a try at home.  I think that this is a very economical dish - tasty and filling.  My friend ordered the Tequila Pine Burgerette ($7) and I thought it looked pretty small.  I had a taste of the burger itself and wasn\'t wowed - but keep in mind that I didn\'t really taste the slaw or mayo that was part of it.\n\nService was friendly as usual!\n\nOn another note  the washrooms are clean but they look like high school washrooms and they REALLY need to get one of the stall doors fixed.  Overall  I won\'t let this deter me and can\'t wait to return for dinner!!\n\nFinal note: Go to The Steady now!  For brunch and dinner!', ""Not only do they have my favourite Niagara Falls beer (Silversmith black lager)  they offer vegan options as well as meat. Now both my boyfriend and I can enjoy dinner easily. Try the vegan salad it's amazing!\nAfter we went once we found ourselves back twice more in a week.\nSo glad we stumbled on this this place."", ""I've been here twice  for both dinner and lunch  and had a great experience both times. For dinner I had the vegan burrito and it was great.  Fresh and tasty and refreshingly different. My husband had a quinoa taco salad (also vegan) and it was to-die-for.  \n\nFor lunch I had a grilled sandwich and coffee  also both delicious and reasonably priced. \n\nAside from the food  my favourite things about this place are definitely the service  which was awesome  the fact that they have plenty of vegan options  and the beer and drink selection. The space itself is also very cool and they have dance party nights that look like they would be a lot of fun. \n\nI will definitely return."", 'By far the best vegan donut (and probably the best donut) I\'ve ever had. They far outshine every other vegan donut in this city! I also love that this place has vegan brunch options as well as meat options - I don\'t feel guilty bringing my non-vegan friends here. I\'ve had better vegan ""egg"" dishes but the vegan eggs benny was still quite tasty.', 'Great food I had the chicken and avocado enchiladas and they were delicious and filling. They have amazing service my drink was never empty. They host really fun events in the evening and have really good fun DJs playing at them. The Steady is a great addition to the neighbourhood and ill def be headed there as often as possible!!!', ""I am writing this review because we came here for brunch based on a good review from what I consider to be a reputable source  a review I now find baffling. \n\nThe service was efficient and polite  and there was no wait for a table but the food was really  really sub-par. We had the Biscuits and Gravy and the Southern Skillet and found them both very tasteless and under-seasoned. The ingredients did not seem to be of a very high quality and the portions were less than generous for the price also. \n\nLike most people who live in Toronto I have been to a lot of brunch spots and this one does not hold up. \n\nI don't know if maybe the vegan and veggie options are the real draw here or if it was just an off day but based on my experience I would definitely not return here for brunch and I cannot recommend it."", 'Wonderful brunch (lots of gluten free and vegan options)  very tasty coffee and a cool and alternative vibe. The service was slow - my coffee came fast but the food took a while. But hey  who is in a rush on Saturday morning anyway? LGBT community seems to be regular customers. I will  definitely return for brunch and also want to check out their evening events.', 'This place feels like somewhere Elvis would go for a hungover breakfast the morning after a show. There\'s a huge flamingo by the front window  flamingo wallpaper  white lights strung up over the ceiling  pastel coloured paint on the wall  a case of pink glazed donuts by the front (vegan and made fresh) and an ENORMOUS and retro looking industrial grade coffee maker (they don\'t have drop coffee  just Americanos). You can either eat in the front which has a hot pink bench running along one wall and a retro cafe feel or you can eat in the back on the dance floor at one of the many tables.\n\nAs for food there are vegan and meat options. I opted for the classic breakfast with two eggs  hash browns  bacon  and greens. I ordered the eggs over medium and hallelujah they came over medium. Coffee refills were $1 and something but the one Americano was so strong I didn\'t need any more coffee. No toast came with the meal but the hash browns were a large portion and crispy so I didn\'t miss the toast. \n\nService was great. The food took a while to come out so our server gave us a free donut. It had just been made so it was so soft  extremely sweet and had a slight cinnamon taste. It was delicious  didn\'t taste vegan. It reminded me of a beaver tail. The day we went it had a pink glaze and was called the ""Cuba Libre"" donut  I think probably because Fidel Castro had died that morning.', 'I\'ve been to this place more than a few times now and each time I\'ve never been disappointed. \n\nThe brunch is fantastic and full of flavor. I am a basic person so I usually order the ""this or that"" breakfast and man  the hasbrowns are the best I\'ve ever had. This is saying a lot because usually a basic breakfast is just that  basic and this was not. \n\nThe service was also nothing short of awesome. \n\nI ordered donuts as an appetizer. Try the donuts. Actually  just try one and if you say you don\'t want more  you\'re a liar.', 'From the outside you may not think this restaurant has great brunch or is super gluten and vegan friendly but it is. A pleasant surprise and not super busy on a Saturday morning.', ""Decor is super cute but the food is hit or miss (some is really good and some is really bad) but the service is TERRIBLE.

Flavourful and filling without being a drippy mess. Cool decor  great music selection  and the service was spot on.', ""No complaints here.

We were visiting Toronto for the weekend and spotted this place and menu by walking by.  It was a Saturday night  and the place was closed.  However  we noticed that they serve a Vegan Benny!  We were staying in the entertainment district  but we made plans to come back to this neighborhood in the morning before we hit the road.  After all  that unique option is probably worth it.\n\nWe arrived at 10 am (1 hr after their posted hours said they were open)  and it looked like we were the first ones in the door.  The server told us that they just opened and we can sit anywhere.  The place has a cool look - very similar to the old school city diners.  \n\nWe both ordered a cup of coffee  a Vegan Benny  and two of their popular vegan donuts.  Right away  we were told that the donuts haven't been made and that it will be a while.  So  we understood and just ordered the meals.  As a few more tables arrived  we continued to wait.  As we waited  we drank our coffee (which was a damn fine cup of coffee) - but there weren't free refills.  The server made one cup at a time  and there'd be an additional charge for a refill.  It actually came as quite a shock  because diners that look like this (or represent themselves like this) is classic Americana  where an aging man can still drink an entire pot of black coffee as the world passes him by.  But I couldn't.  Instead  we continued to wait.  The Vegan Benny arrived at our table 50 minutes later.  We waited 50 minutes in a diner for our brunch.  From what I observed  so did many other tables.  \n\nI'm going to try and separate the food's end result from the experience.\nHonestly  the Vegan Benny tasted good.  It was a unique item  done pretty well  and I'd probably like to eat something like that again.  Meanwhile  the fresh fruit on the side was about 3 pieces of melon.  So in short  the brunch was small.  Very small.  And we waited forever for this  without being offered an apology or a second cup of coffee!  We paid  and we left.  We were walking out the door around 11:20 am - which was the exact time the server was writing up the sidewalk chalkboard sign (2.5 hrs after their posted hrs state they're open)  advertising their vegan donut special.  \n\nMaybe they do open at 10 am.  Maybe it was the cook's first day on the job.  Maybe the server has never socialized with other human beings.  It could've just been a very bad shift on this one specific day.  But I probably won't be back to find out if it has more to offer."", ""Holy cannoli this place is cute.\nPink flamingo wallpaper  pastels everywhere  an image of Bowie juxtaposed beside an illustration of a unicorn sleeping between two hunks of bread.

I went here recently for brunch and I left feeling like I could have stayed at home and/or longing to go somewhere else for more food. Vegan options were lacking. The vegan eggs benny was gross and a very small portion. The baked french toast was good at first  but tasted worse with every bite. I don\'t have much of a sweet tooth  so opinions on it may vary. It was also very cold inside and the bathroom only had cold water and no paper towels. The service was very  very slow. When asked how the food was we replied saying we were disatifised and the server just said ""Ok.."" and walked away. The other server also didn\'t bother to ask me why I only ate one quarter of my plate. I do not recommend this place at all. Go eat across street at Hogtown Vegan.', 'Finally managed to go here for brunch. And it did not disappoint. Plenty of vegan and gluten-free options (with a couple being in both categories) - including the only vegan donuts in the city that are also gf. Sadly they had just sold out of the donuts when we got around to ordering. Three of us had the vegan egg benny (mine on a tostada instead of the bun to de-glutenify it)  and one person had the vegan banana foster waffle. Delicious food all around. Standard brunch pricing (vegan benny was $14)  good portions.\n\nGreat atmosphere - pleasant music  loads of room between tables  pretty chill all around. Great service - very friendly and helpful. They seem accommodating as well in making substitutions  which is always incredibly pleasant and welcome.\n\nBathrooms could be cleaned more frequently. They were fine  but there was paper all over the floor. A sweep here and there would up the place for sure.', 'I was super excited to try out The Steady as I had walked past it quite a few times and liked the look of the menu which appeared to adventurously deviate from the regular Eggs Benny brunch formula that so many cafes follow. \n\nThe Southern Skillet caught my eye- ""Fresh Spinach  Breakfast Sausage  Fire-Roasted Bell Peppers  Onions  Mushrooms  Grape Tomatoes on a bed of Golden Hashbrowns  Topped with Cheese and 2 Fried Eggs Cooked the Way You Like \'em"". The overall concept of the dish sounds amazing but I was sorely disappointed as a result of the following- the breakfast sausage was so bland and I felt was though it was just there to add some meaty texture to the dish. Minimal flavour was also an issue with the cheese but perhaps I am more used to a sharper cheddar. The hashbrowns weren\'t so golden and I think they could have been pan fried for a few minutes more. The scrambled eggs were well cooked. A few bites in  I ended up asking Keaton for ketchup and it was unfortunate that I had to rely on ketchup and hot sauce to add flavour to the meal rather than compliment it. \n\nThe mocha I ordered was tasty and I am willing to give this place another try as their sweet breakfast options do sound amazing.', 'Great service  cool ambience  well priced food! Would definitely go back. The hash browns were amazing!', 'My favourite weekend brunch spot in the neighbourhood. Pricey but worth a visit every now and again', ""This is a cute spot. Came in here on a Friday night after Nazareth/Drift were full  tired from a week of work and desperate for something to eat. The cocktail menu looks really promising - tempted to get something but opted for a lot of water instead. My partner and I ordered 4 tapas style dishes and while they sounded really good  some stuff (ribs  pork) came back a bit too charred for our liking.  Good flavours  but nothing you can't make at home with some basic ingredients. Overall we were not disappointed but not overly enthused. Will probably come back to try out the brunch menu since that may be their thing!"", 'Went here with my fiance for brunch on a Saturday morning at 10:30am recently. When we arrived there were only a few other tables being used  but it got progressively fuller as the time went on.\n\nI had the special that day  which was a Miami inspired breakfast burrito. Overall  I\'d say my meal was a 4 out of 5 and tasted just delicious. I\'m not sure why it\'s served with ""salad"" (aka lettuce...which seems to be the thing to put beside brunch and call it salad.) But the burrito was so good  I didn\'t really care about what was beside it.\n\nMy fiance had the normal breakfast  you know  2 eggs  hash browns and sausage. It wasn\'t really that much of a standout  and she found that the sausage was SUPER full of rosemary  so if you\'re not into that I\'d say get the bacon.\n\nOur service was pretty good  however we did see two tables come in  sit for 15-20 mins then get up and leave. There was one server when we arrived  and the second server didn\'t get there until 11:30 or so when we left...I guess they needed him earlier.\n\nOverall  this place was good  and if someone wanted to go there again I wouldn\'t say no. However  in a city where you can find a well executed brunch with regular frequency  The Steady was good but not standout.', ""We showed up to an empty restaurant at 11 am with a reservation for 7 people. Our food took well over an hour after ordering to arrive  with another table arriving after us and eating before us. \n\nWhen the food finally arrived  it was fairly mediocre - the skillet meals looked great  but the other breakfast plates failed to impress. Limp  half-cooked hashbrowns  overdone bacon  and the vegan benny was relatively tasteless. The biscuits and gravy is $14 and consists of two biscuits without a side  which seems steep.\n\nThe service was friendly  but nobody acknowledged the fact that our meals took forever.  Seeing as the service took so long that one of our party had to ask for her meal to be expedited so she could make it in time for her movie at 1 pm (2 hours after we arrived)  it seems like they could have easily comped her coffee or the like. I think The Steady has recently introduced breakfast  so maybe they are still working out the kinks. This is a business in my neighbourhood that I want to patronize  but I don't think I'll be going back there for breakfast anytime soon."", 'The Steady is pretty awesome. I had been watching the restaurant for a while  and had it on my ""to check out"" list  and as soon as I heard they launched a brunch menu  I could wait no longer! \n\nThey take reservations for brunch (more awesomeness points ) so I took advantage of this by bringing in a giant party of 16 to test out the brunch menu! They had no problems accommodating this  and set up two large tables in the back facing each other so our large group was able to stay in the same area.\n\nIf you\'re looking for some hair of the dog  they have a pretty awesome and creative brunch cocktail menu. I didn\'t try one myself  but I heard some very good things from my fellow dining companions that did try one.\n\nThe Steady has a really alternative vibe (which I love ) and the servers and cooks really emulate that vibe also. While our servers were super friendly  service did leave a little something to be desired (could check in on us more  food and drinks were very slow  even for a group of this size) Note: no splitting bills here.\n\nThe food is amaaaaaaaaaazing. LOTS of options for meat lovers  vegans  and gluten intolerant people alike. The ""This & That"" breakfast  that seems really simple  but consists of lots of breakfast staple options (eggs  bacon or sausage  biscuit or hashbrows  fruit or greens  etc.) and had  by far  the best scrambled eggs I have ever had the pleasure of consuming in my life. They were cooked perfectly  and seasoned sooo well. My description just doesn\'t do them justice. I don\'t know if they slip drugs into those eggs because they are addictive as heck  but trust me  try them. My boyfriend ended up ordering an extra side of 5 eggs because they were so good.\n\nI had the red velvet pancakes that came with a coconut sauce  and they were quite yummy.

After we got our drinks service continued to be poor. Went back the second time hoping for a better experience.

I've been to so many bars where the bartenders aren't the friendlist( of course I understand what they have to go through most of the time) but here they were so friendly :)\n\nMy next step is to go and try their brunch that I keep hearing great things about. \nWhat a cool place  dancing and great food :)\n\nLove it!"", ""I have been to this bar many many a times. \nGreat beer selection. \nGreat bartender (girl).\nAsshat owner.

We were in for lunch  so we had oyster shooters ( good\nidea but oysters themselves tasted like they were canned - maybe I am used to fresh west coast oysters? Not sure)  the shrimp BLT  and the club.  Both were excellent.

Okay wine list.Tonight I tried the Shrimp Manzetti's.

It was really good  thick  juicy  etc.... fries were great. Fiance got the gumbo and we got wings for the appetizer. All her stuff was excellent too. Lots of people there on a Thursday night. Waiter was quick and attentive without being annoying. All in all  it was $34 for everything. \n\nIf was a little hard to find at first.

There is also an Italian place nearby which another couple had mentioned was good with outdoor seating as well."", 'Since I travel so much  I think I only eat out in CLT when someone takes me. Boy  am I glad someone took me here!  \n\nAtmosphere - It is like a standard steakhouse  dark stained wood bar  white table cloth  hosts in black  servers in white. This and the location  South Park  led me to believe it would be pricey  for what you get it was not. \n\nService - Pleasant and willing to go with the crowd was our server. When she inquired if needed anything to make the dish spectacular  we asked what she had to accomplish this and she quipped ""ketchup?"" We all laughed. \n\nFood - To start we had calamari  which was lightly breaded and fried for the proper length of time. It came with a side of chunky marinara that added nicely to the dish. For the main  I had the 11 oz barrel cut filet mignon  medium. This came with a house salad (mixed greens  chopped eggs  almonds  tomatoes  bacon & ham) w/ balsamic vinaigrette and my choice of side (mixed vegetables). The salad was basic  good and came w/ croissant drizzled w/ sweet honey. The filet was made to order  but the signature charring (see side note below) is an acquired taste. For dessert I had their  actually someone else\'s  key lime pie as the pie is made based on a Miami Fl recipe. It was very good  but the texture was gritty which took away from it being perfect. \n\nPrice - Filet mignon  salad  mixed vegetables ($28.95)  Fried calamari $8.95  Key lime pie $5.95 and water...priceless! (I always get water w/ a fine meal.) \n\nOverall - Great experience and will definitely go again. \n\nSide note: Being a former Pittsburgher  I enjoyed this off their menu explaining how the place started out and why they ""char"" the steak: ""Shortly after Prohibition ended  Frank Manzetti  known as ""Z"" to his buddies in the East Side steakhouses  left Manhattan to open his restaurant on the South Jersey shore not far from Atlantic City. While serving a variety of foods  he specialized in steaks and his reputation for thick  juicy cuts with a seared exterior quickly spread in this vacation resort. One fateful day a tourist called Frank out of the kitchen to proclaim  ""this steak sure tastes good  but it looks like something I pulled out of the fire at the steel mill where I work in Pittsburgh."" From that day forward  steaks prepared in the Manzetti style became known throughout the Western World  or at least Southern New Jersey  as ""Pittsburghed"" and ""Z"" Manzetti took on the additional moniker of ""Pittsburgh Frank."" We welcome the chance to continue the tradition."" \n\nI enjoyed my meal an\' nat.', 'We ate at Manzetti\'s last Friday and were very disappointed.  We were greeted at the door by scantily dressed cocktail waitresses.  I don\'t have a problem with bars and clubs who have servers wearing teensy-weensie halter tops but its not what you expect at an upscale restaurant.  We sat at the bar and were surprised by the limited selection of beers on tap. They ought to give up the ""tavern"" part of their name.  Then when we were seated our waitress could not have been ruder.  Very unfriendly and obviously not in the mood to be waiting the table.  The food is mediocre at best and overpriced for what you get.  We had 6 people in our party and no one was impressed.', ""Man you just CANNOT beat Manzettis  one of the best places to eat in Charlotte year in  year out......when you think of all the one time HOT restaurants that have come and gone in the last 15-20 yrs  or ones that are still here but not good anymore  and then you have this place and it still has kickass food/service...well  thats a RARE thing today...you can go and close your eyes and point and an item and always get a winner..plus the same bartenders that've been there for decades can make a good stiff drink.....STILL the place i default to when company comes to town and we go out to eat after 18 years of living here"", ""We went to Manzetti's tonight and had a great time. The food was great and very affordable.  The steak was one of the best I have had."", 'They have a good burger and the salads are good. I have to say  my favorite things there are the croissant that comes with the dinner salad (I would usually ask for another one LOL) and the spinach dip. :O) You will see lots of suits at lunch time  it is a big lunch spot for the surrounding companies and they are pretty fast with service  so it is good for that. Small bar  but clean and comfortable. Good sized tables and booths for meeting and talking about stuff with co-workers etc.', ""I had low country crab cakes for lunch because I was in the mood for something expensive that day.

With so many great restaurants in Charlotte I doubt I will be running back to Manzetti's anytime soon."", ""Many years from now when I am more overweight and battling diabetes and hypertension I will find some big shot attorney to sue Yelp for this predicament. I won't have to name Manzetti's in this suit though because I doubt I will ever go back there. I had just finished some shopping at South Park Mall with the sig-o and decided to see what eating places were near so we could have an early dinner and avoid the Saturday night crowds. The first problem with this place is finding it since it is located in the rear of a shopping complex. I really think they should send their scantily clothed hostesses to traipse  about in the parking lot to make this place easier to find. I am sure this is a gimmick they have for this certain restaurant but being a Friend of Dorothy I was immune to it. I am not lobbying to dress your hostesses like a Presbyterian preacher's wife but use some tact. Since it was around 4:30 pm  business was light and we were readily seated. The place has that dark wood and friendly tavern feel. Our waiter was mostly attentive but had the personality of a throw pillow. I am sure he wasn't at all pleased to have to service the large group of people next to us. I worked in food service for four years and no matter what kind of night you are having you have to fake it sometimes. \n\nWe ordered the BBQ chicken chips as an appetizer which came out pretty fast. The appetizer was pretty good and the saving grace of our entire meal. Still nothing spectacular. The sig-o ordered the spicy shrimp stuffed baguette. The shrimp were cooked to the consistency of the rubber balls you get out of the quarter machine at the local Wal-Mart. The spicy flavor had soaked into the bread instead of staying on the shrimp. The fries accompanying the baguette were very good. I ordered the penne del rey (penne  Alfredo  peppers  snow peas  mushrooms and squash). Don' let the name fool you however  there is nothing from the sea in this dish. I knew this of course before ordering it so this is just a warning not a complaint. The veggies in the dish were woefully undercooked. The sauce was just OK but nothing that couldn't be replicated at your local Fazoli's. We weren't adventurous enough to get dessert and it's not like our waiter offered it anyway. After having two sub par experiences in Charlotte from the local places we may have to hit up some chains. I regret not getting a steak since this is what they are known for. I would have given this place a solid three stars but when you give me unfriendly service I can't forgive that (still left a 18% tip too). Perhaps this place isn't as bad as I am making it out to be but you only get one chance to make a first impression."", ""I had my first experience at Manzetti's last night...and I loved it.  The atmosphere was casual  but not overly casual.  The music was playing low  but it was pop music  creating a fun atmosphere.  The decor was simple  yet elegant  with dark wood features.  \n\nWe ordered cheap ($5-$6) glasses of wine (yes  they have them!) and they were delicious.  Having read good reviews about their chip appetizers  I decided that we had to try one.  We went with the spinach and cheese atop tortilla chips and it was a delicious way to start the dinner.  \n\nI followed up the app with the Spicy Shrimp Stuffed Baguette.  The presentation was very interesting.  A baguette was hollowed out and stuffed with shrimp in a brown sauce.  Eating it was easy because nothing fell out.  Biting into it was out of this world.  It had an explosion of cajun flavor that I wasn't expecting.  And  loving spicy food  the hotness factor was just right for me (although a bit too spicy for my partner).   The accompanying fries were plentiful  yummy  fairly thick  and fresh out of the fryer (ouch!).   \n\nManzetti's is a great place to go for a night out or to bring out-of-town guests to impress them.  The American menu has enough to please those with a variety of tastes.  \n\np.s. The service was awesome  too  and the manager even stopped by to see if everything was okay."", 'Was near the South Park Mall in the CLT and wanted some food that wasn\'t from a big chain  so fired up the Yelp app and found Manzetti\'s.\n\nKind of located in an awkward location  wrapped on the ""back"" side of a shopping complex up against a hotel  making it a bit hard to find if you\'re not looking for it. Got there just after noon on a Saturday and were seated immediately. There\'s a full bar as you walk in  with booths and a dedicated dining area to the side. Fairly pleasant inside  dark stained woods  white tablecloths  white shirted waiters  etc. The only off putting thing were the streetwalk...I mean hostesses. Seriously two of them were dressed in very short skirts and midriff baring halter tops...and with fishnet stockings. Really odd. \n\nSplit the BBQ chicken chips as an appetizer (see photo). Huge - definitely good for at least 4 people. Pretty good  but I\'d probably try the spinach dip ones next time.\n\nOur entrées were the spicy shrimp stuffed baguette and the penne del rey (penne  alrefredo  peppers  snow peas  mushrooms and squash...but oddly enough nothing from the sea  despite the name)\n\nMy baguette came out hot  and the side of fries were really good  but the shrimp themselves were *really* overcooked. Like dog chew toy tough. Too bad too  otherwise it would have been great. The penne del rey was also ok  but unremarkable.\n\nService was competent  if a bit unfriendly. Our server was covering several big tables though  so I\'ll just chalk that up to being overwhelmed. \n\nSo overall 3/5 for food  service  atmosphere - I\'ll give them the benefit of the doubt on the negatives I had. They are known for being a steakhouse though  so I might have had a better experience getting steaks.', ""I've ate here several times and I must say  the food is always excellent.  I've had a variety of items off their menu from salads  club sandwiches  to their bacon cheeseburger  again  all of which were great.\n\nI've only ever had one bad experience here which was at early dinnertime on a Saturday (4pm).  My wife and I took our kids with us to eat here and the waitress seemed extremely annoyed and bothered at the fact we brought children into the restaurant.  The service wasn't that bad  there were just several sighs  grinch-looking faces  and disapproving looks throughout the service --in hindsight  perhaps she had gas?\n\nWith the exception of that experience  every other experience here has been great.  Good service  great food  and the prices are pretty reasonable.  I will be eating here again.""]"

The numbers are staggering but the one that hit me the most was that they serve one in four children in Las Vegas.  That\'s a staggering number of kids who depend on Three Square to augment or provide their food needs.\n\nThe three reviewers being roasted were Max Jacobson  Al Mancini  and John Curtas. Their reviews appear in the local free papers and they are known to the foodie community in Las Vegas.  This was a chance for the chefs to fight back  so to speak  and roast these critics for what they\'ve said in their past reviews.  Chefs there to roast were Todd Harrington (executive chef of Central by Michel Richard in Caesars)  Stephen Hopcraft (executive chef of STK in the Cosmopolitan and former Top Chef contestant)  Gary LaMorte (corporate chef for the Michael Mina Group)  Vic Vegas (executive chef of Vic\'s Restaurant in Henderson and former Next Food Network Star contestant)  Carla Pellegrino (executive chef of Bratalian Neapolitan Cantina in Town Square and former Top Chef contestant)  and Beni Valasquez (exceutive chef at the Bar + Bistro in the Arts District). Also roasting was Theresa Woo of the family that owns Fu in the Hard Rock Hotel).\n\nIt was a fun evening with a lot of laughs  some good food  and good beer and wine or so my table mates told me.

She had appeared on the All Star edition where they shop and at the conclusion of their shopping trip  they donate all of the food to a local food bank.

I had the opportunity to visit the campus while attending the launch for Spring Restaurant Week with Misti Y.  Chad S.  and a few other cool Yelpers.

As visitors at the launch party  guests were able to see the kitchens and some of the meeting rooms  as well as mingle with Three Square staff. Portions of proceeds from Spring Restaurant Week directly benefit Three Square  thus the reason for the launch being held at the campus.

I've been wanting to volunteer at this facility since I heard about it  but it's difficult with my work schedule during the week.

Worked in an assembly line of volunteers and I was the mayo and box sealer guy  The box food is for kid's who may not have any food for dinner(school provides lunch for these kids). The package box dinner is delivered that night to over 400 kids in Vegas! Oh by the way the facility there is AWESOME! Very nice counter tops and appliances.

This food bank is the only one here in Southern Nevada  as the other one is in Reno. So you can imagine what a task it is for them to service the Vegas Valley. The food warehouse was as big as Costco! We were given a tour and also briefed on this wonderful organization. They are able to turn $1 into 3 meals. Bringing food is great but Three Square is able to get the best price possible for food with their purchasing power so seems like monetary donation is better. But they will take food as that is what we spent the morning sorting through looking at expiration dates. Then we packed them up in boxes to be shipped out to the different food facilities throughout Las Vegas.\nIt is heartbreaking the number of kids that go hungry in our community and now with school almost out  most of these children won't be able to count on a meal.

Initially I called the Food Bank to sign up and the employee I spoke to informed me that I could sign-up online and view the volunteer calendar. At that point  I went online to the volunteer page and completed the forms. It only took a few minutes and after about 10-15 mins I was able to log in and view the calendar. \n\nI was able to volunteer several different days and during those days I worked in the volunteer room. In the volunteer room we sorted and box or bagged food for distribution by the food bank. The employees in this area were really nice and organized. The food bank also uses an electronic sign-in system for volunteers and automatically tracks your volunteers hours. Each volunteer also has there own identification number which is also nice because it keeps things organized. \n\nI really hope to be able to volunteer again with Three Square and possibly work in one of the other volunteer areas like the kitchen preparing school lunches. I think the employees  building  and programs at the Three Square campus are all great. The building is clean and beautiful and I really can't wait to go back because my experience was so great. The organization of the staff really stood out and made me happy because I felt my time was used efficiently.  \n\nFYI- I just learned that they some times offer Saturday volunteer opportunities in the volunteer room in addition to the other weekend programs they offer."", 'I volunteered with a group from yelp to help with the ""backpack for kids"" program.

We put on our handy dandy yelp finger-less gloves (thanks Drew!)  grabbed a plastic bag  went down the line putting the amount posted on each food/drink bin in the bag and repeated the process until we were finished. It only took a couple of hours and together we packed over 3 200 bags! It\'s such a shame any child is hungry  but thank heavens for this program! These will go to children who might have nothing to eat over the weekend or when they are not at school. I had obviously heard of Three Square before  but I had no idea about this program as well the other volunteer opportunities available. I\'m happy to have helped knowing how many kids were given meals and plan on volunteering here again! You should too! \n\nCheck the calender on their website or call for upcoming opportunities that you can get involved in!', 'I volunteered here for the first time about a week ago and let me tell you  I was blown away. The facility is gorgeous and the people working were genuinely happy to be there. They made the volunteer process easy and always had someone available to help us when things got a little confusing. I signed up for more hours right after this first time.', ""Honestly  I've only come here for BINGO events. I wish I could say i stop by to volunteer but i barely have time to think with everything I'm doing with my life. But as for these BINGO events  they are always fun and the people who attend are so full of excitement. The workers/volunteers who help carry out the event do an awesome job. During the BINGO events  you can order food from the volunteer staff that comes around to take orders. Their food isn't bad and the pricing for it isn't outrageous. If you feel like having a good time and giving back  there BINGO nights are definitely worth your while."", 'I know this review is long overdue but really thinking of best way too Honor such class act organization. Organization that gives SO much back into our own community making sure no ones goes hunger man  women  or child. Every year they do wonderful job with Restaurant Week here in Vegas. Launch the event had party with some of the restaurants participating dishes out some of there food and wine. They had so much food not sure if able too get taste of all of them. Everything that had opportunity too taste was awesome. The location is kind of sneaky since its off the road tucked in the back. Once you find it AMAZED with the inside from the classy show kitchen area right up front (they were serving up some of tasting menu items)  the meeting rooms  dining area  and caught quick glance of the kitchen. Everything is all state of the art and shows the amount of support and class act organization. I love three squares logo is clear  bold  and shows the mission statement below it. I meet some  of the upper management. Brain believe his name. Too see him walking around dishes out samples  hearing the enthusiasm  and passion ever worker at three squares. Makes me proud know amazing non profit organizations care about world we live in the need less fortunate ones in life!!! \n\nThanks for Terri R for taking me along for this event. Too see more fellow yelpers that night all supporting wonderful cause. Thanks too Misti for always keeping yelping not only fun but all kinds of events that shows yelper care about our community. It good times meeting lot of new yelpers that night!!', ""I volunteered here for the first time and absolutely LOVE what they stand for! We were given a tour I the facility and I was just amazed of how many individuals they are able to help in the community. They are able to get dinner bags to children in a discrete way that otherwise wouldn't eat dinner because their family don't have the financial resources to provide it. I look forward to helping out more and getting my teenage daughter involved as well so she can see that other people don't have it as easily as some."", 'This is a great charity that I will enjoy participating.  Anything to do with food  you have my attention.  Added value is that I will be helping those who need it the most.  I will sadly admit I have only volunteer once  for the Backpack for Kids program.  But they are the sponsor behind Restaurant Week that happens twice a year.  So after attending an Yelp event where they have an assortment of charities that Yelp is partnered with  I took the time to educate myself with this charity by speaking to someone there.  With that being said  they have A LOT of opportunities for volunteering and have fun at the same time.  My next visit to them will be to help pack dinners for kids and that would mean I get to be in their kitchen!  I have walked by their kitchen and seen the operation and I am all excited to be able to be in that kitchen and working...updates soon to follow my experience in this kitchen!', 'My wife and I had the privilege of touring the Three Square food bank on Friday (4/25/14) and I must say that the word ""impressive"" only comes close to describing our experience.  This is a giant facility (think Costco or Costcos in size) and we learned that they do a lot of good within their community.  The statistics on meals served and food collected were staggering.  It seemed like each time we thought the tour might be finishing up there was a new portion of the facility and or community service to go over.  Our tour was with Vanessa and despite her claim of having never given a tour before both my wife and I were blown away by her knowledge of the facility and the work being done by the nonprofit as a whole.  I was struck not only by the genuine caring of the employees at the facility but also by the effectiveness of the operation. Having done some large scale events in the past I am very impressed with well run operations and logistics.  Three Square appears to excel in both of those categories.  Kudos to Three Square and their staff for exceeding my wife and I\'s high expectations of what makes up a great nonprofit.', ""Three square is a phenomenal organization. I have had the good fortune to meet with the leadership of this organization and received a tour of the facility. I have a long history of working with a food bank in my previous life (in Chicago...one of the best in the world) however I am extremely impressed with three square! I'll share this:\n\n2 times a week back pack program - roughly 7000 bags of food for underprivileged children who we ensure have food to eat over the weekend when they go home Friday after school.\n\nNutritious meals provided at schools that need help feeding low income children throughout the valley\n\nProviding food to all the various agencies throughout the valley that helps low income people (children  families  and seniors)\n\nI love this organization and I encourage everyone in the valley to learn about three square  hunger and how we all need to take an active part in getting rid of hunger\n\nhttp://www.threesquare.org/"", 'I went with the Meadows school as a volunteer. I was blown away by this place. Its big  extremely clean and well organized.

The facility is absolutely gorgeous  and immaculate. The team is friendly  upbeat and on the same page. They explain the entire story of Three Square to you  and set you up for success while volunteering by getting your heart in the right place. Taking every precaution to be sanitary  you're fit with gloves and a hairnet after washing your hands. \n\nInside the kitchen  you're assigned to a line and shown what to do. There are 'runners' who will refill your station for you when you run out of food  so you don't have to leave your post. The process is organized and precise  and you're mixed in with experienced volunteers so there's help all around you if it's needed. Perfection. \n\nI love that in a mere 4 hours  you're able to help pump out up to 10 000 meals for those who don't have access to them. ...and we're not talking fast food. These are healthy  balanced meals that will fuel bodies instead of bogging them down. I love it. \n\nMy team had such an incredible experience here  that we plan to volunteer once each month. \n\nI'm super impressed by you  Three Square. Thank you for all you do for our community! :)"", ""Three Square is a delightful place to visit and volunteer! Their building/warehouse is beautiful and spacious inside  and the volunteer area - where I've sorted cans/items and packed boxes with the Las Vegas Wranglers hockey team - is clean and organized. \n\nAll of the Three Square staff and volunteers I've worked with have been super friendly and welcoming. When you show up to volunteer  they do a great job of getting you situated and answering questions along the way. \n\nThree Square is doing something important and crucial for our city  and it's always worth helping them out with a donation of goods or your time. Lovely organization!"", ""Three Square has to be in my top 3 favorite charities in Las Vegas. Their mission is simple  feed local families in need. At school  at home  at work  on weekends... Three Square is there to help feed members of the community. They are savvy enough to throw some great event while fund raising  so check out their website for upcoming events. Also take a look at the volunteer schedule. There are opportunities almost every day and it's an easy process to get a group signed up for a day of volunteering. The Yelp volunteer day was on a Thursday morning and we ended up packing weekend bags of food for children. It was an easy gig (there were children and seniors helping out) and overall we packed over 3200 weekend meals in about 2 hours. Not into volunteering? That's OK. This is one charity where your money is well spent if you feel like donating some green bills."", 'Three Square is one of my favorite volunteer opportunities in the valley. Thanks to Terri R  we had a chance to give back to our community. The sort-a-thon was a great success with over 30 plus volunteers sorting through multiple pallets like mad people. Hearing and seeing some of the basic necessities that some of our fellow citizens go without has definitely revitalize my desire to donate my time.', ""Three Square Food Bank is the local non-profit that supplies food and household items to area charities for distribution to those in need.  They don't distribute directly to families  instead they collect all of the items  sort it  and sell it to organizations who serve the needy.\n\nMy family has been volunteering here for over 2 yrs.  My Son spends many hours during the Summer and my Wife and I volunteer when we can.  There are many jobs that you can work.  Most of the time we help in the warehouse area sorting food and household items.  It's monotonous work  but if volunteers don't do it the work doesn't get done quickly as there are so many items to sort.\n\nThe facility is large and well kept.  The workers there are passionate about their job and are very patient with us volunteers.  With so many volunteers that rotate in/out of the place they must have a lot of patience to train us.\n\nI encourage everyone to consider doing it.  It's really easy to sign up.....fill out a form online and then show up on scheduled dates/times.  Here's the link to more info and to the online volunteer form:\nhttp://www.threesquare.org/how-to-help/volunteer/\n\nWe enjoy working here and will continue to volunteer as long as we're a part of this community."", ""I've had Three Square Food Bank bookmarked for quite some time. I even remember reaching out to fellow Yelper  Cresta I  who use to have weekly check in's here. She gave me the scoop  told me how to sign up  and then it was up to me. Fast forward a couple of months later and I still haven't volunteered here.  It wasn't until Terri R organized a sort-a-thon for us Yelpers  that I finally got the chance to give back.  Terri is the best and sets this up monthly.  \n\nThree Squares Food Bank is clean and very organized. To volunteer  you don't have to procrastinate like me and wait for a Yelp round up.  You can complete an application in person or sign up through their website.  Yes  it's that easy. Once you're signed up and commited  Three Square will assign different jobs depending on what's needed. Our job was to sort pallets of food  drinks  snacks  baby items  clothing  and miscellanous items.  Once sorted  the pallets are then brought into their warehouse pending distribution.  If you're willing to donate about 3 hours of your time to give back  I recommend giving Three Square Food Bank a shot."", ""It's wonderful to share food & feed people who are less fortunate then some of us.

Volunteers pack bags of food for kids who do have a meal when they get home at night or for the weekends they are out of school. \n\nI've volunteer a handful of times here and every time I am impressed at how much they do and how much they have grown in the past five years. \n\nVolunteering with this organization is easy and there are plenty of opportunity.

I know many may feel like volunteering sometimes seems a little overwhelming. I volunteered here with Charlie L  and it was such a wonderful experience! They have three warehouses that are huge! The interior of the main warehouse is very modern and hip. The facilities are clean  and they are very good about following sanitation guidelines \n\nI got to pack already made cooked meals into those little tv dinner trays to sell to the senior centers and hospitals. I must admit. The food looked so delicious! I really wanted to try it! They had corn with pieces of minced bell peppers  baked chicken with bbq sauce  and seasoned baked potatoes. we pack them into the tv dinner  and weight them precisely to the ounce so everyone gets a fare share (no one gets one more potato than the other!). Pablo  the chef  was such a nice and funny guy! He helped make the experience fun for us  and cracking jokes and teasing me! He's amazing. \n\nThe place is so friendly! The staff is wonderful  and great part is  we gave back and even went home with new friends. I even got to know my assembly line friend.

Anything that involves giving back to my community  I'm all in. I love this place because it allows people to help other people who need it. Hunger is an existing issue in Vegas  and Three Square is an organization that made it possible to create change to feed as much of our hunger population in Vegas.\n\nWhen I volunteer  it is always food-packing meals for students  or packing assorted fruits in bundles. Either way  we were always dealing with a sanitary environment with special instructions on the amount and quality of food we're supposed to pack.\n\nIt takes a couple of hours to get as much in as we can. It's like working in a fast paced environment and always constantly on the move. I absolutely have no problem with that when I know that the more we're able to make  the more we're able to feed.\n\nThis is a great organization with a large and clean environment to work in.

We cleaned plastic bins that were going to be used to pack meals for the community.The coordinators were very helpful and informative  enthusiastic and friendly.

Thank you!!"", ""Once again the Palms Pools provided a welcoming venue for the 4th Annual Dish Las Vegas event benefiting Three Square and its efforts to provide food for the hungry and strive to establish a hunger free community.  There were not as many local restaurants participating this year  and beef was less prevalent than scallops  but with the dynamic Zowie Bowie and Marley Taylor performing and backed by an energetic band  the live entertainment was much improved  and there was still fine food aplenty.  \n\nMy favorite samplings this time were N9NE's huge King Crab Claws  excellent Crab Cake and hot Shrimp from Rhythm Kitchen  Cold Filet Salad and delicious Seared Scallop with a spicy bite and creamy Potato Foam offered by The Charcoal Room  excellent Russian Black Caviar graciously provided by Artisinal Foods  and Chocolate Hazelnut Cake and several other decadent desserts laid out by Chocolate & Spice Bakery.  \n\nBesides the scantilly-dressed lady whose body was painted with bright colors during the event  one of the most interesting looking dishes was RM Seafood's Peruvian Bay Scallop on a bed of Chinese Black Beans with Lime & Micro Mint inside a clam shell.  I got to meet and speak with its owner and Executive Chef  Rick Moonen  as well as Executive Chef Stephen Hopcroft of STK.  A couple of my eating experiences were mixed.  Top of the World's Salmon with Lemon Buerre Blanc contained tasty salmon  but the strong lemony flavor of the Lemon Buerre Blanc overwhelmed the fish.  And  although I liked NOVE's grilled Pork Belly with Butternut Squash  the flatbread that accompanied it was rather bland and undistinguished.  \n\nThe night passed swiftly and enjoyably as the 300 or so attendees sampled various culinary inventions.  And it was all for a very good cause!"", ""Located in North Las Vegas off Craig & Pecos you will find this beautiful facility with a North & South campus. If you are a visitor you do have to check in at the North Campus first. Three Square Food Bank is AWESOME! I just recently started volunteering more this year with my job  and Three Square has been one of the consistent places that we partner with to come out and help. \n\nBeing a volunteer and apart of such a great movement just really feels good. One of the great things that I learned on my first visit here is that they don't just feed families in Clark County but also Nye  Lincoln and Esmeralda! The food that they receive comes from multiple resources such as local retail and grocery stores\n\nThe actual volunteer work is really fun and rewarding! It works just like a buffet.. Essentially they line up all these different canned foods and snacks so that you can just go down the line and put whatever quantity of items are needed for each bag and once you reach 3 000 bags for that day your humble volunteer work is done!

I was so happy when they opened as being from back East and being spoiled with great restaurants (and living here for 23 years) it seems Arizona and especially the east valley is lacking REAL ice cream stores.

The Peanut Butter parfait is seriously a Peanut Butter lovers dream.  Loaded with chunks of peanut butter (not PB cups).  It must be their top seller because if you go there late  they are sold out of that flavor.  The whipped cream is fluffy and delicious  the hot fudge is rich and chocolaty.  LOVE this place.  They will even serve your puppy a doggy sundae with a little treat on top.  I just wish it wasn't so close to my house because now I cannot stop eating there."", ""This place reminds me of an ice cream spot you'd find in the Midwest.  It's legit premium small batch ice cream and their flavors change every few days it seems.  The key lime and lemon cream flavors of the month are crazy good!\n\nThe staff is all terrific too.  Everyone has been so friendly and they insist you try as many flavors as you like.  Eric (I think that's his name!) recognizes our family and made up a special banana concoction that our son loves.

I'm kind of obsessed with ice cream  so my husband and I take the kids to try different ice cream places pretty regularly. We've tried dozens of ice cream places in the area and don't often repeat places (generally  we just prefer to try something new). We went to Brusters for the first time tonight and it is definitely a new favorite! We will be back. A lot. \n\nThe flavors we tried were all delicious. The shake was perfect (I prefer a thinner milkshake  so you might not like it if you want something thick). The prices were reasonable. The service was excellent.

Waffle Cones are great and made onsite.', 'So we\'ve been 3x to really give it our approval or not. Went on Mothers Day. The 2 young men working were very nice! They told me about the little kid cone for my toddler  but she insisted on ""big girl"" ice cream. They also let them taste flavors. When I didn\'t order anything for myself  he seemed disappointed and said ""but  it\'s mothers day?!"". I said that\'s what mothers do. Everything was great. Lots to choose from. Great service.\nWent a second time on a Sunday afternoon. Again great service but 1/2 as many ice cream flavors to pick from. A third time on a Saturday night within an hour of closing. They were super busy still. But they did their best to get people served quickly. BUT... They had posters up of ice cream they said they didn\'t even have yet. We tried to order 2 other flavors on the board that they were out of. Seriously there was about 6 flavors to pick from. There were 7 of us that went  and 3 decided to not get anything due to choices available. We will definitely be back by I may call ahead to ask what flavors they have! Coconut chip and peanut butter cream is to die for! Can\'t wait to try the ones on the poster also! Portions are gigantic. A small is more than enough for any normal adult. Lol', ""We rolled in on a Sunday to try this ice cream spot! We were thrilled it was open  since so many places are closed on Sunday. I had a waffle cone with Boston Creme and S'mores ice cream. Both were delicious. The cone was crispy and lite and tasty. The only negative is there is no inside seating at all. Walk up window only. There are a few picnic benches with misters as an option but at 115° degrees today  it wasn't ideal. Loved the ice ream. Sad we couldn't sit inside and enjoy a sundae in the heat of the summer.  Still a great option if you want to eat a cone in a parking lot or pick up a pint to take home. There was a family sitting in their car  eating their cones. As three adults we were struggling to catch the melting streams of ice cream  we opted for keeping the interior of the car clean.  Great ice cream. Will visit on cooler days or evenings  next time!"", 'Omg!!!! Every flavor is freaking amazing!! This will definitely be a new favorite spot! A co-worker told me about this place and how amazing all of the ice cream is (real freshly-made ice cream!) So glad I tried it out!

Boston creme pie was super good too!! Mmmm!! I will definitely be back!', 'Wow! Flavors are amazing. We tried the Mudslide which is delicious  and the Sea salt caramel with toffee which was equally delicious. Our cashier was very friendly and helpful.

We will definitely be back!', ""Not often do I give a place 5 stars  but damn how could you not give an ice cream place 5 stars! This was hidden gem in Gilbert  but based on the lines I've been waiting in lately  I think their secret is out! Never the less great variety of flavors and combinations. Staff is friendly and quick about fulfilling your order. Prices are decent and family friendly! Beware  if you go late on a Friday or Saturday night you will be waiting in line!

Was a really nice spot in our neighborhood. \n\n\n\nFavorite local ice cream spot. Love that they have doggie ice cream for our puppies. They enjoy it so much! Reminds me so much of my home on the east cost.', ""I really like the idea of this place: Walk-up window where you can order ice cream. There is a very large menu of items from which one can order. However  I feel that all these options are mediocre and almost overwhelming. We sampled multiple flavors  and I felt that the ice cream lacked distinguishing features. I am a huge cookie dough fan...I could call myself a cookie dough aficionado. Their cookie dough mix-in was kind of sad. I got a cone with cookie dough mix-in. Essentially  my cookie dough was scooped on top of my cone and pressed down into the cone so that it would stay. On the other hand  the service was phenomenal. Everyone was very friend  patient  and helpful. It did take them a while for us to order our items since they were training new people  but they made up for it when we interacted with them. This place is good enough  but I wouldn't take my out-of-town friends/family here if they were looking for a good AZ ice cream store.""]"

It's surprising this city doesn't have better wine bars but this was definitely our favourite wine bar that we've been to. Amazing selection of wines and food  and we both got two different mystery 3-oz flights that we had lots of fun trying to guess. They even made sure we both got different wines so that there'd be more variety for us to try! We then got the house bread and butter  3 different cheeses (a cheddar  Gouda  and creamy Brie-like one  all of which were delicious)  and split a steak as our main. Really appreciated them splitting up our main into two plates (small things like that go such a long way) and the service was perfect. The only complaint  which warrants one less star  is charging $4 for what tasted like whole wheat sandwich bread (and only 4 slices). It was ok but definitely should be complimentary.

A friend took me there because we went on a cupcake tasting that day. He said a better product was awaiting me as the grand finale. When I walked in the store  I didn\'t know who the owner was  until my friend pointed it out when we left. I wanted to take a look around  it was nicely decorated  but I could clearly see the person in charge slightly annoyed that I wanted to browse before buying. I explained it my first time at the store and she pushed me to buy a large cake. I explained again that I was not from Scottsdale and am only one person. So I\'m not going to buy a large cake. When we started talking a bit more  I could see her employees sort of clam up. I had no idea what was going on. When I chose my little cake  any sort of customer service went out the window once the money transaction occurred.  She didn\'t even say  ""Thank you "" It was so unusual for a bakery or any business dealing with customers. I was upset and quite frankly  so angry that I wanted to turn around an return my cake and tell the owner to keep my money. I am not rich - I am passionate about bakeries and tour around when I\'m in a new town to support local business. I was genuinely interested in hearing about the seasonal cake that she was trying to sell me. I had heard through other locals that they love the cakes  but not the owner when she\'s in the shop because she\'s so rude. I give this a two stars because I liked the cakes  but the service was very  very caustic that I could not justify scoring more. She cuts people off  - that was feedback I had received from previous customers. My local friends said that they cannot build rapport with the service workers there because there is always a new person. That made me wonder what was going on. I was trying to figure out how she stayed in business  but then heard she has a contract that keeps her afloat to sell cakes to a prominent medical clinic. I love the cakes there - the store is creative  but I sense a level of stress that turned me off.

Sadly  we did not find it at Nothing Bundt Cakes. Don\'t get me wrong; It was okay  but it didn\'t even come close to the quality and taste that we experienced with Tammie Coe\'s red velvet cupcake. I think we got spoiled by having her cupcake first  because all of the other variations have failed to impress us as much  if at all. There were two major problems with the bundt that we tried here: First  it was too heavy. Maybe that\'s just the nature of the bundt itself  but we found it to be way too heavy and rich  which only allowed us to eat about half of the thing. Two: It didn\'t have a lot of flavor. I know that might sound contradictory to my last statement about it being rich  but just because something is rich and heavy doesn\'t automatically mean that it has a lot of flavor  which this dessert clearly didn\'t have. It was missing that ""wow"" factor  that melt in your mouth so good you want another one  type of feeling that we get with TC cupcakes.

At the time of pickup they lost the order and had no record of the payment. My husband was treated like he was a criminal --- after walking out they offered to ""give"" him a cake--- one he had already paid for.  Bad experience to have on his birthday.

I narrowed the 1.76 billion down to six but couldn\'t get it down any farther. So  I did what any other semi-smart  logical male with a sweet tooth would do - I bought all six.  \n\nI won\'t bother you with my own favorite (it was red velvet if you must know)  suffice to say they were all fresh  moist and delicious.  \n\nAnd  no I didn\'t eat all six bundt cakes (my wife wouldn\'t let me).

The cake is moist and flavorful and dense  but somehow doesn't seem heavy or processed.  And it's not too sweet.  How do they manage that?\n\nBut the real kicker is the cream cheese frosting.  yes  my friends  this is what it's all about.  That thick  tangy  sweet  frosting all over that yummy  moist cake.  I think I may have to pick one up on the way home."", 'Stopped in to see if they had 50 small bundt available for a birthday and they did. We mixed a bunch of flavors chocolate chip was my favorite.

Note: you have to call in at least 10 minutes ahead of time to give them time to decorate the cake.  Not a big deal since the cake is definitely worth the wait.   OK  back to the carrot cake... we get it home and much to my surprise it looked and tasted like a spiced apple cake.

We took great joy in trying to locate any evidence of carrot at all  so fun was had by all.   \n\nHERE is why I am taking  the time to write this...The next day I called to talk with the proprietor of this particular store to complain that I got the wrong cake.  So I was geared up for a fight.  I thought for sure I'd need a receipt. I need to bring back the uneaten cake if any  etc. NONE of that was true.  I DID get carrot cake  though not one that any of us had seen or tasted before.  Sometimes different is GOOD.  I did NOT need a receipt  instead what i got was a sincere apology and a promise to make good on my expectations.   \n\nI can tell you this much.  The owner is committed to customer service.

I have tried other places for special occasions   but I always end up coming here.  I love how moist their cakes are.  My favorite are the lemon and the chocolate one  so either works for a birthday cake (hint  hint).  Last month for my birthday the kids and my husband went to get a cake.  As soon as they got in the store  my husband told me the kids went straight to the sample tray  haha.  Then my little girl told him  ""mom loves the lemon one"" (she only likes the lemon)  so he had to get a small bundt chocolate cake for my little boy.

Everything tastes real without the ick of over sugaring you get from a lot of commercial cakes. I really don't know how else to describe it other than awesome  delicious  wonderful cakes! My favorite is the chocolate chocolate chip with the white with white chocolate frosting as a close second. I haven't been impressed with the seasonal flavors except confetti which should be part of the regular line up because it's amazing. My favorite size is the bundtlet  which is just enough to be filling but not too much that you make yourself sick on dessert :). I think the cake moisture/consistency loses a little bit when they go down to the bundtini size but they are cute and a great size for parties."", ""I would give them 5 stars for their bundt cakes but had to give 2 stars for their customer service. They messed up my order so I had to go back and get it straightened out. Very inconvenient as I was on the way to a party. Once I showed them what was wrong they didn't apologize until I actually said this was an inconvenience. They also just said OK took about 5 minutes to get my order correct and then just handed me the bag and asked if I needed anything else and that's when I said NO and this was very inconvenient  then they said sorry."", ""The cakes are delicious. I have had most flavors. The customer service is poor. Picking up a cake should be a happy experience. The woman at the counter  I think her name was Margie  rudely told me that my cake wasn't the only one back there and that I needed to explain what it looked like. I would think my name that I ordered under would be enough."", ""These bundt cakes are pretty good in a pinch when you want to puck up something quick and pretty inexpensive that doesn't look anything like something from s grocery store. They can personalize the bundt cakes with balloons  flowers  or other cute decorative frills in the middle of the cake  which is then wrapped in cello and a nice ribbon. Just make sure the cake isn't straight out of the fridge when you eat it. It's really hard and dense if you eat it that way. The larger size cakes seem to taste better than the mini ones. I like the lemon  cinnamon  marble  and the white chocolate. All cakes come with cream cheese frosting piped don the sides. I wish it was just a touch less sweet  but that's just me. Pretty much everything under $20....not too shabby!"", ""Came here to just try out a few of the bundt cakes --- holy moly they are good. They are so moist  flavorful and have just the right hint of frosting. My husband  who is not a fan of frosting  especially fell in love with these little bits of heaven. \n\nDo yourself and go here - every single one we tried was delicious. They also stayed moist for several days after we purchased them. \n\nThe business itself is a little hard to find and rather small inside. They sell a lot of cute little party type items but I definitely had to keep a tight rein on my two little ones while we waited due to all the things they could possibly break. Next time I would place an order in advance for pick up (due to the kiddos) however we just walked in and didn't have to wait long for our order. \n\nI'm getting a craving for these delicious treats as I write......"", ""I am not a fan of chain bakeries. I prefer nice home made. Home grown establishments. but I decided to try Nothing Bundt Cakes because Scottsdale seems to be lacking in the homegrown anything. \n\nI went on a Sunday Mid Day and the selection of mini bundts was limited.  There was chocolate chocolate  marble and lemon. I tried a lemon mini bundt and it was surprisingly delicious and went well with some cold milk. \n\nThe price is the reason I gave them 4 stars. I am sorry but 4 dollars for a little baby bundt cake is ridiculous. I don't care where you live."", ""I have a sweet tooth  but  it's hard to please. I can easily pass up on average desserts only to come back home and dish one up for myself. From scratch. When I have sugar  it better be as good as it gets; and  the cakes at Nothing Bundt Cakes are just that.\n\nThe cakes are moist  delicious and I love the hidden (almost) tangy notes in the frosting. Com'on  even if you pay twice as much here for a small piece of cake  it's just another two dollars more. Right? I wouldn't waste my time and calories on another cake just to save two bucks."", ""We always get Bundt cake for our birthdays and special occasions. They are a bit pricey but worth it. We all love red velvet but every cake we've had has been delicious. The staff at this store is professional and friendly."", 'Nothing bundt frustration. (Double groan.)\n\nYou know that annoying species of person/hominid at work who emails you with a request only to call you 45.3 seconds later just to make sure that you got their email?\n\nYeah. Nobody wants to be THAT person.\n\nUnfortunately  that\'s what you need to do to make sure you get your cake on time at Nothing Bundt Cakes. \n\nDon\'t get me wrong - the cakes rock. I\'ve had two of them (lemon and red velvet) and they are quite exquisite. But... each time we have gone to pick up the cake at the agreed upon time the cake was either 1) not ready or  2) they had given the cake to another customer. \n\nAnd therein lies the problem - people tend to order cakes for events. Events are typically defined as celebratory gatherings where other people who mildly tolerate you  show up in coordinated fashion to consume cake with you and revel in  well  whatever it is that needs to be reveled in. (e.g. Not being dead  etc.). Unfortunately  when the cake isn\'t ready  or it has been given to another customer  (thereby starting a \'they stole my cake - I steal someone else\'s cake - who steals someone else\'s cake\' etc. etc. chain reaction)  it kind of makes the coordinated event not so  er  coordinated.\n\nThe first time it happened  NBC knocked half off the price. The second time it happened  NBC did nothing and we paid full price. No apology either. I guess you could say they simply said ""Let them eat cake."" Ouch.\n\nThe cake is 5 stars. \nThe management at NBC: 1-2 stars.\n\nSo  if you want to try Nothing Bundt Cakes and you need it for an event where people gather at a specified time to eat the cake  you need to honey badger these people into submission.

During my sister's baby shower  I experienced another cake from this heavenly place. Again  we did the chocolate chip with white frosting. The frosting tastes like it was plucked from the clouds of sugar and touched by an Angel on its way down. The chocolate chip cake is like it came from a sea of moist cake batter and blessed by Titan as it was shipped off to the kitchen.

We told our son on the phone to pick up his cake on the way home from work for one of his B/D gifts. When he got there  they had no idea of a cake and balloons ordered for pick up! He called us from the N. Scottsdale Road location and asked us if we sent him to the right store and if there was any kind of order number  which we gave him while he waited for his cake.

About 30 minutes went by and they come out with this cake that had a giant purple flower on it instead of the birthday items we ordered and no balloons that they knew of! They had no cake order ready for him at all! They not only screwed up the order  but the customer service was non existing as they did nothing for him as he waited there! After looking at other reviews from this location  most of the negative reviews were more about terrible customer service. They also answer Yelp Reviews with the same generic repetitive response  and not from any actual real concern. How do they screw up bundt cakes  when their only business is BUNDT CAKES?? And then just throw any flowered cake in a box and call that a completed order? Unbelievable is all I can say for our sons 30th B/D!

Nothing Bundt Cakes! I\'ve been a fan ever since a family friend had their red velvet cake (which happens to have hidden chocolate chips within--YUM) for her bridal shower. ""But  Natalie"" - you say - ""I thought you didn\'t want to cut a cake?"" That\'s true. I did say that. What I forgot to mention were their BUNDTINIS. Tiny bundt cakes that are like cupcakes  but so much better. Did you know the only way to make a cake more moist and delicious is to make it a bundt cake? I will tell you  it\'s the same for cupcakes. \n\nI don\'t know if that\'s scientifically proven. \n\nAnyway  online ordering is simple and quick. I\'ll admit  it took us a while  only because we couldn\'t decide between all the flavors. We ended up with red velvet (a must!)  marble  white chocolate raspberry  carrot  and lemon raspberry. At the party  while my little dude was chowing on his homemade smash cake  I informed the guests of their desserts available... well  I\'m pretty sure there was a stampede for the lemon raspberry and red velvet. Everyone loved their bundtinis (every flavor! People went back for seconds and thirds to keep tasting) and said how cute and creative and DE-LICIOUS they were. Perfect casual cocktail party dessert to eat one handed  plus they are perfectly adorable to boot. \n\nOne last thing  as we had made the personal mistake of requesting them to be ready later than we should have. The day of  we called to see if it would be at all possible to pick them up sooner and they were incredibly understanding and accommodating. With all the party stress  it was a relief to have one thing made easy.', ""love this place!  i bought 4 mini bundt cakes around the holidays to give to friends.  i tried the red velvet and it was amazing!!!!  it's not too sweet so you can actually eat more.  delish!!!"", 'I ordered a cake for a 10am delivery to our neighbor. They call me at 10:30 to say no one is home. I said ""you were supposed to deliver at 10"". They tell me if I want it redelivered that I have to pay another $15!  Like these cakes aren\'t expensive enough right?  This place is a total rip off and worst customer service EVER!  They could have at least made one more attempt to deliver!!!  I had to go pick up the cake and deliver it myself. WOW what a great surprise for my neighbor duh!  Plus there is a super funky sewer smell in the store. It really grossed me out. I won\'t be ordering from them ever again.', ""These cakes are sooooooo good!!  I'm obsessed with them. I love the little buntinis  they are perfectly sized and you get 4 different flavors in a dozen. My absolute favorite flavor is the red devil cake  followed by the lemon and then the white chocolate raspberry (but they are only split by a hair because they are al delicious!). The cream cheese frosting is perfect - not too sweet and just the right amount. I'm ordering 3 dozen for my baby shower coming up and they will be my go-to stop any time I need a cake!"", ""This is a place I wish I never found (in a good way). I treat myself to a bundt from time to time and can't wait for guests from out of town to come so I have a reason to stop here.  I always get the go-to chocolate chocolate chip. The gingerbread and white chocolate raspberry are also very delicious."", 'For starters  if you\'ve never tried a ""nothing Bundt cake"" you MUST visit the store.  This location is the only one I\'ve ever been inside but if they\'re all the same then I know you won\'t be disappointed. It\'s like a little cake boutique with samples and displays so you can get the full picture of what they have to offer.  They offer samples that will hook you in immediately since the taste of their cakes is outstanding.  I\'ve tried almost all the flavors and they\'re all so delicious! White chocolate raspberry is my favorite and has always been a hit with crowds! The bundtinis are perfect for parties or if you just want to try a sample of each flavor ;) Their icing really is the ""icing on the cake"" a perfect compliment to the worlds best Bundt cake!

I feel like I was bothering them... I bought  10 little bundlets and told her it was for gift for the day care teachers... she didn't look up at me and then threw them in a bag and rang me up. Then I asked her if they could wrap them and she was like yes but it will cost you  extra...I paid extra and she seemed so annoyed at me ... honestly it made me a little sad and as much as I love their cakes... no business should treat clients that way! In fact  my husband was going to order a large order for his staff and I asked him not to... let's give the business to people who are nicer!"", ""The cakes are delicious but the past TWO times I've been there they help customers that walk in after me before they take my order.... Frustrating! Causing wait times around 40 minutes. GREAT cakes but better customer service is needed."", ""Fun  tasty cakes and awful customer service! Stay in school kids! We wouldn't go back if they were giving the cakes away for free!"", ""I absolutely love these cakes. Having said that  the past two times I've been there  the gluten free bundlets were a bit dry. They still tasted great  but not as moist as usual."", ""Service is horrible.  Cakes amazing  but not worth the agrivation.\n\nI was there today  and yes  I realize it's close to the holidays.  but   I've been there many times in the middle of summer when no one is even outside.   My order of buntinis was promised in 20 minutes  and finally brought out to me in an hour.  By this point the shop was full of angry customers.  \n\nBottom line: go if you don't care about service  or if the employees care about you.  For me  it's no longer worth it."", ""Beyond delicious! I highly recommend the mini's!  Had a small party and served a bunch of mini's along with a tiered cake (among other desserts.)  No one wanted to eat the tiered cake because it looked so amazing they didn't want to cut it!  It was so beautiful  looked more like a center piece.  The mini's flew off the dessert table.  I should have taken the tiered cake apart and sliced it - but it really was almost to pretty to eat.  2di4!"", 'These things are outstanding.  Just went there yesterday for the first time  and these were amazing.  I bought the bundlets  which are 3.99 each.  I tried the Chocolate Chocolate Chip  Red Velvet  and White Chocolate Raspberry.

He minis are great for kids too!', ""I hope management reads this review. The cakes are sweet but the staff is sour. And that kept me away for a while  but I can't lie anymore  I miss it. I have been there so many times before and each time the customer service is a let down but whom am I lying? I can't keep away. I would like to boycott  but I keep coming back.

Love that they do a gluten free bundt now Definitely going to come back !', ""Nothing Bundt Cakes is awesome!  The cake is super moist and isn't overloaded with frosting.  There are so many fun flavors to choose from too.  I love the white chocolate raspberry  marble  and lemon.  The lemon is a little sweet  I think they use a different frosting for lemon.  The cakes are really pretty and you can get individual ones for under $4.  I will definitely be back and will ask my husband to get me a white chocolate raspberry for my Birthday cake."", 'There is really nothing bad to say about this place!  The cakes are moist and the frosting is sinful!  They have lots of flavors and always have samples...the bundtletts are good for a variety!', ""I placed an order to be delivered by 10:00AM. They showed up at 12.\n\nThe cakes were delicious  but the service was sub-par.

I love the red velvet!  Both the cake and the frosting.  And how cool that they come in mini sizes so I dont have to feel so guilty when I eat them. The owner is fantastic too. She really is a happy  giving person which makes the cakes even taste better.   Definitely  visit this Scottsdale or Arcadia location since she owns both.', 'The Bundt cakes here are dynamite. I have never been disappointed and their website lets you order online and customize your cake. No other cake shops in the valley have an online ordering option f', 'I\'ve had samples of Nothing Bundt Cakes at local events and have always thought they were super moist and delicious. So delicious that I decided to buy a Bundt cake for my mother\'s birthday. I hadn\'t been to this store previously and the location is near a bunch of shopping areas but actually kind hard to find. I accidently drove past the first time and had to turn around. There was plenty of parking though  so that was nice. The outside glass is reflective  so it was impossible to see inside - I wasn\'t sure if they were open or busy. I took a chance and walked in to find the store empty. Bundt cakes were everywhere and looking every inch of delicious. An employee walked out and asked if I needed any help. I told her I\'d take the 10"" Red Velvet Bundt Cake in the display case and she went in the back to box it up for me. She was extremely friendly and super talkative/bubbly. She had definitely been getting a sugar rush from all the Bundt cakes! As she was finalizing the box  I also ordered a tiny Pecan Bundt from the display case for my husband. The employee was happy to oblige and I was on by way. \n\nWe kept the Bundt cakes refrigerated and pulled them out prior to serving them so they had time to get to room temperature. Honestly  you could eat them directly from the fridge but letting them sit out does taste just a slightly bit better. My mom really liked the cake and it was a success. I\'d definitely go back and get more Bundt cakes.', ""These cakes are delicious and perfect for special occasions. I buy the three buntlets  so I have a variety of flavors for our group of 4 adults. They look festive wrapped in cellophane with a fabric ribbon and silk flower.  I've purchased from both the location on Scottsdale Rd and on Indian School and both are excellent."", ""All I've got to say  is that this place continues to rock my world! Birthday  after birthday  and maybe even on unbirthdays  this place never lets me down. \n\nThere might come a time when I grow tired of the double chocolate bundt cake  but I don't want to think about that day.  Instead  I think I'll go finish the rest of the cake left over from the other night's party.\n\nMmmmmmm"", 'Simply amazing cake for any occasion!!Never  ever have we been disappointed with Nothing Bundt Cakes. I highly recommend! Your taste buds will be happy! : )', 'Just recently  my sister needed a cake and asked me where to go. Knowing my sister\'s likes (since they are similar to mine)  I immediately screamed  ""Nothing Bundt Cakes!"" \n\nLet me explain why I heart Nothing Bundt Cakes. The cakes are moist and best eaten when cold. Random yes  but there\'s a great combination of cold and moisture when you eat them that way. My favorite cake is the chocolate chunk. It has real legit chunks of chocolate in there. As if the cake wasn\'t good enough before  the chunks just add to its splendor. Their red velvet is delicious  their basic bundt cake is delectable...really anything you over there is scrumptious heaven with every bit. They are traditional looking bundt cakes just like your Grandma would make. They have the freshest ingredients and are reasonably priced. \n\nThe frosting deserves its own paragraph. I love frosting. It\'s a weird addiction that I refuse to fix. The creamy cream cheese type frosting is the best and Nothing Bundt Cakes has it mastered. Sometimes with bundt cakes  the frosting is lacking but not here. Their frosting is perfectly placed on the cake and accompanies the cake just right. \n\nI like Nothing Bundt Cakes for birthday parties or even to just satisfy a sweet tooth craving when its just one of those fatty days. The cake is worth every single calorie. I promise.', ""I've never actually been here  but my mother had a cake delivered to my office on Wednesday for my birthday. I obviously spread the joy and shared... people are STILL talking about that damn cake. When I picked it up from our admins desk I was surprised by how much the thing weighed - these are seriously moist cakes  people. The chocolate chocolate was delicious and the whole cake was cooked evenly (maybe these NBC people should give out tips for baking banana bread.. Mine is always gooey in the middle). For a place that I assume bakes mass quantiles of bundt cakes per day  the quality was fantastic. I won't take a star away  but I wish it said somewhere on the cake's paperwork (they included four different brochures/ads) who sent it!"", ""The little bundlets are amazing.  All you cupcake lovers need to run over here and try these.  I bought the marble  carrot  and white chocolate raspberry.  These little babies are moist as can be.  The White Chocolate Raspberry will make your eyes roll up into the back of your head as you moan with delight!\n\nThe really cool thing is the way the hole is filled with frosting.  That way frosting lovers can take the sugar train to jittersville and those that don't like so much can eat around it...no more frosting amount debates.\n\nFinally  the customer service was great.  The lady behind the counter was very helpful with suggestions.  I'll definitely be back to try the other flavors."", 'Happened to find this little gem of a desert shop by mistake.

Great quality and sooo delicious. My favorite is white chocolate raspberry (i dont even like white chocolate!) and next best is lemon and red velvet. Hands down much much MUCH better than Sprinkles.

I would highly recommend this place to anyone with a sweet tooth or someone that needs to bring desert to a pot luck or something', ""Great cake and great service!!! Will definitely be back! Love the minis too. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of my first experience trying to buy a cake  which was...........Didn't realize they close early on Sundays.

The person working there ducked behind the counter and then thought we walked away and started to get up and then quickly went back down behind the counter and crawled around the corner.

But then a client of mine brought me a bundlette for Christmas a few years back  and I've been obsessed ever since. My favorite is the lemon raspberry! It's to die! I die ten times every time I eat it! The girls that work at this location are very sweet(punny!) also.

I've had these before  but stopped in over the weekend to get my mom a couple of bundt cakes and dang I was quite impressed!\nService was good  ladies working there did well! The cakes are pricey but I'd say totally worth it for a treat every now and again. I was excited when the girl there informed me that there were samples of pumpkin spice cake. It was incredible and totally convinced me to buy one! My whole family loved it.\nI've had the chocolate one before  and white chocolate  not sure what else but on Saturday I went for marble and it was also delicious. My family and I were all pleased!

Scottsdale location.  After waiting in a very disorganized line 2 weeks prior to Christmas to pick up a dozen bundtinis for an out of town guest I hoped to impress  I was sorely disappointed in the quality of the red velvet.

I haven't tried all the flavors; however  the ones I've had I love. The nearly melt in your mouth and the flavors are a masterpiece of culinary arts. So far my favorite is the red velvet.

They have small Bundt cakes that are the perfect solo sized treat and pleasure. Great job bakers here!!!"", ""Man  if I could give these folks a ZERO I would. But  there isn't an option for that.... so a one will do. My pharmacist was throwing a surprise party for a coworker and I was sent to have the cake picked up... The cake was ordered a week in advance. I show up on Sunday and hand the girl at the counter by confirmation and there is no cake ready. This is the SECOND time this has happened. I know it was not the girl at the fronts' fault and she was really nice but I am not impressed with the fact I have something ordered and paid for  only to have it not ready when it was promised it would be. Especially if this has happened before. Maybe we should stop hiring kids at the bakery and actually get orders in the night before so this doesn't keep happening.

I guess capitalism trumps love.  =)  I gave it four stars b'c they only had a couple of varieties when we were there.  Also  I was expecting better service.

I can see other new reviews now related to this incidence this afternoon  but I just want to add- how greedy are the business owners. They are accepting and entertaining walk ins while they are making pre-order customers wait that long and be treated rude. Our cakes tasted good but the customer service doesn't deserve any star. It was Nothing Bundt Long Wait and Nothing But the Worst service! It is a shame that the decorated 10in Bundt Cake had the banner dipped into the floral cente   had to repair myself  customized note that was to come with it was not done  the bundtinis' thank you message flags were almost buried entirely into the cupcakes  you can tell that they were done in a hurry haphazardly.

I asked a staff member what they did with the cakes that didn't sell and I found out that they freeze some of the cakes in air tight bags. No law against that but for sure a turn off. So this made me wonder if it is luck of the draw that I get a fresh cake or a thawed out frozen one? I guess they gotta keep their food cost down some how. \n\nCute conceot but I'd say you can get the same quality for less at another local bakery. If you are into paying a high price for ok quality then this is your spot. Staff needs to smile more. Will not be going back to this place."", ""Well  the cake is absolutely amazing. No doubt.

But now people at work keep bringing these little beauties into work and no good can come of it.  \nToday it was the Red Velvet Cake   not only was it moist and rich with flavor   the frosting and style made it look oh so retro in my eyes   which increased it's flavor immediately.

These are amazing. They\'re like fluffy little clouds with creamy frosting. It\'s not overwhelmingly sweet and the flavors were not overdone. I found it SO weird that you can SMELL the flavor as you pick up the bundt cake. HOW? \n\nI got the dozen bundtinis (for $20)  which were pretty much like a dozen cupcakes. But I think the best part about this is the frosting. It\'s just so smooth and creamy and buttery  but not packed with sugar. They put it on for you fresh  so be real careful when you\'re driving them home and make sure they\'re not all smooshed because they\'re so soft and fluffy.\n\nThe flavors available were all amazing. I tried pumpkin (seasonal flavor)  chocolate chip (their most popular)  pecan praline. They also have white chocolate raspberry  carrot  lemon... which all sound so amazing. Assortments that you can choose from. Literally  you can SMELL the cake and guess the flavor  because that\'s how fragrant it was. \n\nService was very kind and friendly. Young teens working  which kinda sucks for them because the kind of customers that come to this location in Scottsdale who think they\'re kings/queens and are so entitled.

So here goes.... little back story is I had back surgery a couple days ago and am supposed to limit how much I'm up and out of the house so that being said.... I sent my 25 year old niece to circle k with my 8 year old daughter to get me a couple packs of cigarettes.  My niece is not a smoker so I sent her a message with what I wanted so she would get the right brand. She comes home about 10 minutes later and gives me the cigarettes and tells me how the cashier was hitting on her. I dont think anything of it as she is very beautiful.  I look in the bag and see the wrong cigarettes. I go out to the living room and ask her what did I ask you to get? She pulls  out her phone and reads the message and tells me she read it exactly to the cashier so she wouldn't  get it wrong. So she goes back to exchange them again with my 8 year old daughter.  She calls me and says store policy is you cant exchange them even with receipt.  She says she tried a couple of times and they kept saying there was nothing they can do. So she buys a correct pack and comes and gets me. As soon as they pull up my 8 year old tells me how the cashier was flirting with my niece again.  So I have her take me up to the store and tell the guys if he hadn't been to busy flirting he would have grabbed the right item. He tells me he was not flirting he was just doing his job and she misunderstood and that she said she wanted 2 packs of traffics. I told him she knows nothing about cigarettes and would not have said those and my 8 year old confirmed to me what she had asked for. The other cashier tries saying that she asked for traffics but according to my niece and daughter he was hanging out with his friends outside . They both proceeded to tell me there was nothing they could do and maybe I shouldn't have somebody else go buy my cigarettes.  I JUST HAD BACK SURGERY! then I told them I wanted to speak to a manager and 1 of the cashiers wrote a number on a piece of paper and said this is the store number but the manager is not here. I told them this is a corporate company and there is a manager on duty somewhere.  The guy told me he could not give me the number. I said fine then call the manager and give me the phone. He told me he couldn't do that. I then told him I wasnt leaving until I spoke with a manger. He called a manager I explained the situation and she told me they would exchange them if I paid the difference.  I said that's fine my niece had already offered to do that. The cashier then proceeded to say next time if the person coming to the store knew what they were getting they wouldn't  have this problem. As we are completing the transaction the cashier told me he was trying to hurry so I could leave cause I scared him . After the transaction was done I apologized for being so rude and he said dont worry about it I've seen worse but next time maybe I should come myself. To top it off the counters were sticky and my niece was told dont worry about it  it's just water. If they want to get paid higher minimum wage maybe they should take more care and pride in their work instead of trying to cover their mistakes and calling my niece and daughter liars.""]"

It's an interesting place in a rather blah location. The parking lot is torn up  it's not easy to get to and it's kind of run down inside. The hookah gets overwhelming for me  but there are plenty of couches/chairs in the back. The DJ was good given what he had to work with and he got people dancing. So all of that does not equal 3 stars. What does jump it up to 3 starts is the food. The kabobs were amazing melt in your mouth. They were out of chicken so we got steak and definitely good food. The hummus was good as well. Overall due to location I probably wouldn't come back unless someone really wanted to go  however if you are in the area or live near there definitely give the food a try as it's really good."", ""I'm glad that someone else mentioned that this was known as the Kabob House  because if they didn't  I'd never have found it.  I don't know that I've ever seen it called Khaneh Kabob (though perhaps that's what it says in their native tongue).\n\nAnyway - the place is indeed clean  though in an odd twist  it's attached to a beverage store.  That's not bad  just a statement of fact.  If you order a kabob that contains steak or chicken  I can definitely see how you might be disappointed - you don't get a lot.\n\nIf you order a kabob that has ground meat  you'll probably have leftovers.  Unfortunately  I can't tell you which kind to order  because we always go with our friends who do the ordering for us  but I can definitely tell you that these are not your typical Americanized shish-kabobs.  These are Persian-style kabobs.  So don't be disappointed.\n\nThe ground-beef-style ones are wrapped around a long  flat skewer and cooked on the skewer  and you get a ton of meat.  I don't know if you have to order side dishes separately  but we always get them - rice  bread and other items - because the meat by itself is good  but you'll want to have other items as well  because it makes it so much better.\n\nService is friendly  but it isn't speedy  and they have not historically been able to communicate particularly well in English."", ""We were the only people in the entire place. Service was okay  I'm pretty sure he was the owner. The food was decent  but the hookah was overpriced. The decor was unusual and everything could have used a good cleaning and a coat of paint. I won't be back to Kabob House."", ""I did not set out to write a bad review.  I have great respect for a small business trying to make their way in the world.  PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE POSTING\n\nPositive:\n\nFood:  The food was on par with a decent meal at a regular restaurant.\n\nService:  Initially good\n\nNegative:\n\nPrice: Double the price of a meal of this style and type.  I did use the yelp coupon and only paid what the meal was actually worth.  It was not worth the original 18 dollars charged.\n\nCoupon:  The establishment tried to tell me that the coupon was not good but they would accept it anyways.  This is after I asked when I first got to the restaurant.  Even if the coupon was not being used any more  yelp guarantees it for 1 year.\n\nAtmosphere:  As usual this restaurant is empty  however on a Friday night we were there when they were setting up for an event on Saturday.  Evidently someone rented out the building for the next day.  They were playing really explicit rap videos on the projector while I had a 7 year old and 1 year old at the restaurant with me.  Not the Establishment per say  but the people setting up for the next day. \n\nBathrooms:  Looked like they were under construction of some sort\n\nWaitress:  Our food was served with rice and meat.  We asked if they had any sauces for the rice  the answer was no.  We asked for mayonnaise  the answer this time was that all the people that eat at this restaurant don't ask for things because there is spices (saffron) already in the rice. (as my wife always uses saffron  the amount of saffron was not worth mentioning) I would completely understand this if there were people in the restaurant  eating but it would seem that the one or two customers they get are for the Hookahs.  This means  maybe they should be open to change instead of telling me what the other people who aren't there eat.\n\nExtra charges:  The food came with bread butter and feta cheese.  They asked if we want some more bread and we said yes.  They charged us on the bill an additional 4 dollars without telling us.\n\nKids menu:  None:  They said there is so much food  that kids eat from their parents.  However  if i let my 7 year old do this  I would not have any food for myself.\n\nAir conditioning;  The air was shut off allowing the entire place to be filled with the smoke from the Hookahs.  However  when we were there no one showed up and no one was smoking a hookah until we left.\n\nNote to other people posting reviews:  Please do not post racist comments about restaurants or cultures you do not know or understand.  After seeing the other comments which seemed racist  I did give the restaurant a try.  There are many restaurants in town that serve this kind of food with better reviews  and they are no different than anyone else.\n\nNote to the owner:  If your restaurant improves these items listed  I would be happy to retract my review  but I would recommend lowering prices. People in Charlotte expect more if you are charging them that amount.  Please don't have your waitress tell me what other people eat there when you have no customers."", ""This place was garbage for hookah.  They didn't even change the water and there was ash inside the hose.  Definitely avoid like the plague if you want to keep your lungs fungus free."", ""Great food  fantastic atmosphere and decor.  I stuck to the non meat dishes  and while there isn't a large selection vegetarian options  they'll occasionally  offer a veggie-kabob on request.  The appetizers include standard fare of cucumber salads  stuffed grape leaves  and roasted eggplant spreads (all exceptional in taste).  The badenjanin in particular is perfectly tart and spicy  but may not be for everyone.  Other than the food  their tea selections are great-- try the spiced chai.\nMy experience on weekend nights has been a full house with a mix of family groups at the tables  and college-age groups enjoying hookah in the pillow clad booths of the tea area.  Some nights feature a belly dancer and middle eastern music.  It fits in well with the decorated interior that's covered in arches an paintings (some on animal skins).  Service has been great 2/3 visits  with attentive and friendly staff open to offering suggestions  and an owner who spends time talking with the various groups.  On one very busy night  service was super slow  but the staff was still friendly and the delicious hookahs kept things calm.  Overall  this kind of place is rare in Charlotte and is worth the visit!"", ""Very good.  I am part Iranian  so I know my Persian food.  Meat here is cooked perfect...very tender.  Came with a large party once and the owner (who is super nice and accommodating) brought us a sampler of all the meat.   In general  I love to order the ground beef kebabs and lamb kebabs at Persian restaurants and this place doesn't disappoint (I like to add sumac  which is on the table to all the meats and sometimes the rice).\n\nOnly disappointment for me is that they don't have a clay oven to make homemade Persian lavash bread like they do in all the restaurants in Atlanta.  Instead you get pita before your meal.  It comes with onion and feta.  You can ask for mint and eat it with the bread  onion  and feta.  Sounds weird  but that is common in Persian restaurants.\n\nEggplant dip is very good and is a must in any Persian restaurant.  I wish they had more than one eggplant dish  though.  Ice cream is really good.  Baklava is good  but not the best I've had.\n\nDefinitely a must try in Charlotte!"", 'The deal is kind of fake to bring people here! \nThe chicken is good but lamb kabab is not fresh  not worthy for what you are paying.   \nAnd the box for the food is 5$.', 'This place is also called the Kabob House. \n\nBasically its a nice restaurant interior with one guy working as hostess  waiter  and a cook.  The place was clean and pleasant but the food was lacking.  \n\nFor the price of $15-22 you get one kabob of meat (7-8 inch by inch cubes)  plain rice  and one tomato slice. i thought the food was not bad although my two friends did not like it(keep in mind they were middle eastern). it just wasnt enough food for the price. \n\nI can get past the slow service  but paying that much for so little was a huge disappointment especially after seeing very high marks for this place on citysearch.', 'The Food was very delicious and it was a nice and calm place with great hookahs', ""My husband has revoked my Groupon privileges. If this review was just for the food it would be an easy 3 or 3.5 stars. The food was all delicious - we had the sauteed eggplant appetizer  the cucumber/tomato/onion salad  shishkabob dinner and burg dinner (not what I ordered but it was still good.) The rest of the experience was kind of bizarre.\n\nWe arrived early on a Saturday evening and were the only dine-in patrons. There were a few booths in the back corner with patrons smoking hookah but it was nearly empty the entire 90+ minutes we were there. There was also some take-out business at the same time. A host led us to a table near the couches/stage area in the back. I immediately noticed that one of the workers (?) was napping on a couch about 10 feet away. \n\nThe music was just something off the laptop of one of the hookah patrons  mostly obscure rap music.\n\nHere's where things got a little weird. We were completely finished eating and the staff was around fixing some other tables (at this point we're still the only dine in patrons)  and then they pull some tables together and the entire staff sits down for dinner in the front of the restaurant. We waited another 20-25 minutes for our waitress to come back and ask if we were finished or wanted dessert. The answer was a resounding no."", ""Beef Kabob gets an easy FIVE Stars!!!  Persian Hot Tea  five stars!!! The Eggplant Dish was very good! The Belly Dancing gets Five stars!!!  Service also gets five stars!\n\nFrom there everything else was Good though none of it was better than three stars and not as flavorful as I hoped  still good!\n\nI'm the Only Dude here!  Eleven Female patrons including my Bride... add two Belly Dancers and our Waitress  I'm out numbered 14 to  1 !!!!!!  Great show!  If you have never seen live Belly Dancing it is Usually Entertaining and though maybe initially awkward it is fun!\n\nPersian Ice Cream nice flavor combination of Pistachio  Rose Water and Saffron less dense than Kulfi - If I had never eaten (Indian Kulfi) I would have probably rated this Ice Cream Higher!\n\nBaklava a bit disappointing  papery filo  though drier than the overly syrupy version"", ""We had an okay experience. The music was just my taste for the most part. I had a piña colada that wasn't great but it was strong. My biggest complaint is the weird seating. It felt like cement blocks they draped in carpets. It had us wondering how exactly do they keep those carpet seats clean. Not the best experience but it was cheap and open late."", 'This place used to be an acceptable place. We visited during 2016 holidays. First of all  there was an offer on Yelp  20 for 40. Absolute sham! There is a sign on the door: no coupons acceptable!

I'd also describe the batter as such.  Not a traditional British taste  but even so  you will not be disappointed.  We all really enjoyed this meal.  The portion size was also perfect for lunch.\nI'm not in this area often but I wouldn't hesitate to eat there again.\nI would recommend."", ""First........the GOOD.   very clean establishment  excellent service  the batter was a near perfect golden brown colour.  The Not-so-Good............The owner needs to realize that fish shops must serve white vinegar  as well as malt vinegar.

To some people  that might be a small thing but not to me. I like my pepper and in quantity. \n\nWhile the portions appear to be large  I found that the Halibut was sliced far too thin and this leads to the fish being dry instead of nice and moist.  Please do not try and fool us this way.  We are not stupid.  Pricing was reasonable and on a par with many other places that specialize in fish and chips.

After eating my long anticipated meal though  I thought better of it  realized that they were insanely busy  and that good food is worth waiting for. And it was indeed worth the wait!\nNext time I\'ll definitely take J\'s advice and phone my order in  then come and pick it up later. \nEven with the place as busy as it was; and even though I had gotten a little cranky after my wait  the staff remained friendly  accommodating  and kept working up a storm. I\'m not sure who was cooking the fish and chips in the back  but they must have been going full tilt  and J and his helper were quickly and efficiently taking orders in person and by phone  packing stuff to go  serving in house customers  and even cooking burgers at the counter for those who ordered them. And in all of it  J still made sure to give every person a nice comment  a thank you for coming  etc. \nNow for the food:  To put it simply; it was AMAZING. Juicy  tender fish  light batter  freshly made thick cut fries  and all piping hot still by the time I got home with it. All for an amazing price. I\'m not much of a fish snob  so I just went with the haddock  and for $6 for a nice piece of fish and more fries than I expected  who could complain? They also offered many other specials  including a $9 halibut and chips  a $6 burger combo  etc. \nThis was some of the best fish and chips I\'ve had. None of that greasy ""it feels like someone painted the roof of my mouth with lard"" feeling during or after eating.  I will DEFINITELY be going back', ""Amazing food. Great portions. \nThe food is fresh and clean. It's not overly oily.\nIf you like fish and chips or even if you don't  this is the place to go. Their burgers are also good and poutine."", 'Was in the area and saw this restaurant. The food is great  not too much batter on the fish and they give you a tray with ketchup  vinegar  mayo  coleslaw  and salt. The tray is neatly organized showing their attention to detail. The owner comes and asks if I needed anything. Very good service. Price is very good as well  I got their $8 lunch special. Very decent portions.']"

From the moment you arrive and smell the flavors and hear the crowds  you know you are in for a culinary treat.\n\nDiners start by ordering at the counter. It may take some time to navigate the menu as the names are all crazy. Take the time to read them all or just ask some questions as all options are delicious. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful and seemed to be having a blast working here.\n\nThe food highlight was the pierogi platter ($11). It was very great to try different varieties and flavors on one plate. The kanapki ($6) were great and are also offered on a rotating basis of delicious flavors. The carrot puree was my favorite. After eating delicious comfort food  don't forget to save room for dessert as they offer some great options. The apple tart ($5) was sweet and sour and savory all in one and I would definitely recommend it.\n\nOverall  I really appreciated how this meatless restaurant was able to flaunt that fact with interesting flavor combinations. I don't want to eat meat at a restaurant like this and I'm glad they don't fill their menu with meat substitutes. Embrace the veggies and grains. I would highly recommend this restaurant to veg eaters or meat eaters alike in Pittsburgh."", ""Completely lovely in every way! The delicious food  wonderful people  and soothing decor. :) We enjoyed the kanapki  kartofle  and pierogis. The mixed drinks and authentic Polish beer (Okocim) more than hit the spot. Everything we had was bursting with flavor! Great job Apteka crew - can't wait to come back."", ""Unlike anything else in Pittsburgh! From the minute you arrive until you leave this place will blow you away.\n\nUpon arrival you stop to order at what appears to be the bar area. It's kind of Smallman Galley (ish) where you order and pay at the counter before choosing your own seat with a table number. You can review the menu before arriving  but honestly the hostess did such a fabulous job explaining everything just go with it. The line never went down and even with people breathing down our backs to order the hostess never made us feel rushed. She was so sweet and took care in making recommendations and explaining our best choices to cater to my nut allergy. \n\nPer the recommendations we ordered three items: Boczniaki z kapusta  the Perogi and the Kluski Slaskie. We also each had a drink. Marissa had the Becherovka  house tonic & burnt lemon and I had the Fernet  scotch  apple cider. I took one look at the drink menu and had no idea what to order so I let the staff pick for me! I am in no way a scotch drinker  but I loved this drink! I was still skeptical when it arrived at the table I wasn't sure what to expect. It was incredible. One of my favorite drinks in Pittsburgh. Go out on a limb and try it! \n\nWe waited no time at all for our order. I'd be surprised to say it took even 15 minutes. The dishes are presented beautifully. We split all three items and it was a perfect amount for the two of us. The Boczniaki z kapusta was by far my favorite dish. The mushrooms are roasted perfectly and the butternut sauce tops if off. The Klushi Slaskie dumplings are a bit flavorless on their own. With the help of the sauce they are magical. \n\nIf you are planning your visit be sure to ask for recommendations. The staff is super knowledgeable and kind. You will not be disappointed."", ""Fantastic food in a lively and fun minimalist-inspired environment. Thoroughly enjoyed my pierogies and kanapki  and my wife and I split an apple tart that was easily one of the best desserts I have ever had. Amazing and innovative cocktails. When we went I got the Riga balsam cocktail  which was probably the best mixed drink I've ever had  as well. I highly recommend that if it is still on the menu when you visit. My only complaint is that it was a little frustrating ordering at the counter. The place seems busy and fancy enough to justify not having customers order at the counter  at least for dinner service. Overall  though  4.5/5 stars. Will definitely be going back."", 'Yesterday was the Unblurred or First Fridays on Penn. After watching the weather all day we decided  ""Hooray  no rain""  and made our way out into the neighborhood. After walking up and down Penn Ave and seeing some great art and listening to some music we needed some food. There are not a ton of places to eat up on Penn Ave  but the ones that are there are always so good that it makes it hard to pick one. I for one have never been to Apteka and have been eyeing it up for some time. Since we were close and it was an easy walk I was able to get us to go there. Right when we walked in it was busy  but the server told us the food comes out really fast and the turnover for tables is very fast too. By the time we ordered we already had a table  she was not kidding. We asked her opinions on some of the dishes  just because it was a bit overwhelming to look at the wall menu and then the littler menu by the counter. We finally settled on a small plate  two large ones  and a dessert. Very exciting stuff. The decor is simple and very nice. The tables were close together but the diners are friendly and we even chatted a bit with our neighbors to the right. They were long time Apteka customers and had lots of suggestions for the next time we visited. I like places where you feel that the customer base is so nice that it is easier to sit so close because it is friendly. \n\nSmall Plates: \nBoczniaki z kapusta: oyster mushroom + braised cabbage in beer broth + butternut miso + rye crumb. OK. This was our favorite dish out of all the ones that we tried. My goodness. The butternut miso was fantastic. It was so good that we dipped some pierogies in in  some of our other bread in it  and just scrapped the plate. It was a really nice mix of flavors and blended so well. I would get this again for sure. \n\nBig Plates:\nPierogi: Z kapusta i grzybami / seler z jablkiem i ziemniakami i chrzanem: Sauerkraut + mushroom . Celeriac + apple + potato + horseradish. Honestly  I did not like all of the flavors of the pierogies as much as I expected too. I think that the sauerkraut and mushroom was the only one that I really truly liked. It came with a side of greens  some turnips  and I believe some crushed nuts. The greens were fantastic  the turnips were good  and the pierogies  they were ok. I liked the dough  I liked the presentation  I would have just preferred the one flavor over any of the others. \n\nSpecial Sandwich: Veg pate + smoked apple and chilis + red cabbage slaw + salt pickled turnip + savory sauce. This was my dish and I really enjoyed it. I would have liked a bit more of the savory sauce because it was so good! I think that it was the smoked apple  but wowza  what an amazing flavor. Next time I would ask for the sandwich to be cut in half. I had a hard time cutting it and it was a bit bigger so it was easier to handle in two pieces. But because of the fresh bread and only having a butter knife it was a little messy to cut into two. I thought that the veg pate  something that I have never tried or thought about was really great. I was surprised how much I really enjoyed this meal. \n\nDessert:\nTarta jablkowa: Tarta jablkowa z sosem z suszonych owocow. Apple tart + dried fruit compote. Again. YUM. This was a nice end to the meal for sure. The tart was crisp and the fruit on the top was delicious. I enjoyed the little drizzle of fruit something on it too. I would suggest ending the meal with this treat. \n\nThe place was beautiful  the service was fast and friendly  and the food was great. I cannot wait to come back. I am so happy to be able to come here on such a fun Friday night. It really made the start of the weekend so much better.', ""I was surprised by the high rating of this restaurant and my experience as it certainly was not the same. As a vegan I am always on the lookout for a wonderful vegan experience and this was unfortunately it. Let me break it down for you. \n\nUnlike a true upscale restaurant you order as you come in the door. The menu is written on table paper and pinned to the wall. After you order you have to walk around and find an available table. We were fortunate that we found one fairly quickly. \n\nMeals: bland. Because I am unfamiliar with the type of food Apteka serves I  ordered the 2nd dish on the large plates and had my partner order the peorogies. I was surprised that my meal was actually a salad. Why would I go to a vegan restaurant to order a salad when I can get that anywhere...this is what my friends said when my order came. The salad was good but not great.  My partner shared his meal with me but the sauce tasted sour so I didn't like it. \n\nCons: I don't like ordering my dinner at a counter  grabbing my silverware and finding my own table in this type of restaurant. While the servers  or food runners  were pleasant they did not come back to check on you. \n\nPositives: the service and atmosphere. The food came quickly and the atmosphere was great although a little too dark for my liking. \n\nI am truly upset that I cannot support my community of vegans but this is not an establishment that I nor my friends would visit again. For a true pleasant vegan experience I'll go back to the Doublewide Grill."", ""Guys I'm so confused. So confused. I like to think I'm a hip person who frequents gallery crawls and drinks red wine and decorates my house with tons of plants  but this was truly the most millennial thing I've ever done. And I thought I was super millennial. \n\nYou walk in  are fronted with a huge wall menu  place your order  and sit. Anyone who has ever been to Gaucho (which def isn't Vegan) it's a very similar set up. That's cool I don't mind that. I've also have vegan food from other vegan restaurants and really enjoyed it (no I'm not vegan). \n\nWe sat in the back room which I didn't realize was like a garage area till after  when I started to freeze. It was so cold in there. I did enjoy the vibe and happiness around and ambience with the lighting. \n\nThe food: I ordered the pierogies and the potato pancakes. The potato pancakes were ok  but they were cold. Maybe they were supposed to be? The pierogies were good but I'm sorry I really don't think they're as amazing as everyone says they are. I liked the sauces and relishes with the dishes more than the actual dish. \n\nMaybe I'll be back? I kinda want this 5 star restaurant that everyone else is saying it is."", ""So happy that Apteka finally opened their doors. They definitely did not disappoint.  Nice relaxed and minimalistic atmosphere.  Pierogis were definitely the highlight.  Was told that they will be rotating types of pierogis in the future.  The borscht was very good  a seemingly simple broth with a nice complex flavor.  They make an awesome hot pepper oil/sauce too.  Everything I've tried so far has been great.  Hope that they will expand their menu in the future.  Make sure to try a cocktail too!"", ""Food: Excellent. From the entree to desert  they did a fabulous job of making some healthy and tasty vegetable dishes.\n\nService: Good. Everyone were pretty friendly  you have to order at the front desk and the food is brought out to you.\n\nOverall: Based on prices  quality and service  I would highly recommend this spot if you're in the Burgh."", 'my oh my...... I loved this place. Not only is it completely vegan  but they also have booze! The drink style reminded me of my favorite bar back home in Seattle (I was visiting from out of town). They are unqiue and forms of art. The drink I ordered did not have the right taste for me  but I liked the character it had. Luckily my friend liked it and I liked hers so we traded. We ordered quite a few dishes and each was fantastic taste. I wish I had one of these back home.', 'I visited this place after it was featured by Eater.\nApteka has Eastern European cuisine  but it is difficult to understand what country is from.\nFood was ok  but I expected more authentic taste and better cleanliness overall. Service was a little bit slow. More $$$ than $$', ""Finally made it to Apteka and will definitely be back! I'm so surprised and happy has a place like this. It's all vegan and very trendy. Priced well too. You order at the bar when you come in like a cafe then they bring the food to you. Staff was friendly and food came quick. The pirogies were delicious."", 'Fantastic place! Great Polish fusion restaurant. Amazing drinks. Love the wildflower with tequila. All the dishes are beautifully prepared.\nNone of my friends can believe that everything is vegan  they love it so. \nThe space is eclectic and wood toned. Love the fresh bouquets of flowers. \nAnd the signs on the unisex bathrooms are awesome! \nOne of the top restaurants in Pittsburgh. And super affordable too.', ""Met with a group of friends on a busy (loud  crowded) Saturday night for dinner and drinks. Our table ordered pierogies  lima bean/potato dish (kluski slaske)  latkes  salatke 2 (dill!)  and baba jaga sandwiches  some to share  and some not. Everybody loved all the food. I thought the sear on the pierogies was a little strong  but the whole dish was such a delightful concatenation of textures and flavors that I didn't much notice. 4 is definitely plenty for one person; next time I might offer to share and get a second dish to share. I will say that the kluski slaske is not visually appealing  but I would definitely order it again  so warm and creamy was it. The Czech in me very much enjoyed my slivovitz cocktail. I would like to come back and treat myself to the rest of the list  starting with the bourbon."", 'I\'ve always hated vegetables  because it\'s so hard to cook a decent meal by themselves. This restaurant has probably changed my life forever. If I\'m ever back in Pittsburgh  stopping here is a must. I had the 7 pierogi plate  Kanapki  and their special Yogurt Rhubarb. The three tartines were an amazing start  my favorite being the red pepper and tomato one (and tomatoes are my second least favorite vegetable!). The pierogies were for a fact the best food I\'ve had to date. A nutty granola crunch  rosetip dust  and yogurt sauce topped two varieties of pierogies: potato apple  and my favorite  mushroom and sauerkraut. I absolutely HATE mushrooms and sauerkraut  but these pierogies were for a fact the best food I have EVER eaten. It\'s hard to make a pierogi feel light  but they did a wonderful job at it. Ended with the yogurt Rhubarb for a semi-dessert. I could have that for breakfast everyday.\n\nThe restaurant was a little packed by the door where you order  but the aromas and open ""backyard"" seating make up for it entirely.\nIf you\'re considering eating here  DO IT!', ""I don't think I am hipster enough for this restaurant.  I have never in my life seen so many beanies and large framed glasses.  That being said  the food is delicious even though I have no idea what I ate because I couldn't read anything on the menu.  It is really cool that they were able to make vegan Polish food taste so good.  I would definitely come back just because the food was delicious.  They also have lots of different Polish beers on tap."", 'This is by far the best vegan restaurant I have ever eaten at. We come from Ohio  so this was quite the treat for us. From the relaxing ambience  to the congenial staff  to the meticulousness behind the preparation of the food  this was well worth the price. You must try appetizers  main courses  desserts and mixed drinks to get the full experience. Bon apetit!', ""Tried Apteka for the first time today  but it certainly won't be my last! It has a modern  bright  greenhouse feel that's perfect for dinner with friends or a brunch date. There's also a back yard  perfect for larger get togethers when the weather is nice. \n\nWe had the 1) special sandwich  2) Bocziniaki z Kapusta  3) Pierogis (7 for $11). \n\n1) veggie pate on homemade bread. Taste is likened to BBQ (sweet and salty). Rather hefty portion\n2) one word: umami. The oyster mushrooms were well done and ingredients blended very nicely (beer  squash  miso  rye crumbs). \n3) two kinds: smoked cabbage & potato and sauerkraut & mushroom. Both are very good. Felt more like dumplings than pierogis. Crispy on the outside  flavorful and stuffed on the inside. This is perfect for 2! \n\nWe each tried a different house made soda: poppyseed (the most unique flavor. Tasted creamy/thick - likened to a very watered down horchatta (tastier though!!)  lavender (tasted like you'd expect - my favorite)  and wildflower (zesty  lemon-like  refreshing) \n\nI can't wait to come back and try the other plates!"", ""Though this is a vegan place (and I'm not vegan)  I am a big fan! I've had the pierogies (SO GOOD) and the kanapki  along with a handful of their cocktails and wine. The menu might seem intimidating but fear not - the employees here are happy to explain and answer questions. Always a hoppin' place in the evenings so you may have to wait a few minutes to snag a table  but that just gives you extra time to enjoy one of their cool drinks! Street parking is relatively easy on penn Ave in this area. Definitely will return to Apteka."", 'I am the literal definition of a carnivore  the kind that orders an extra steak or lambchop for dessert. Vegan or not  the meal I had last Friday was nothing short of amazing. The tartines were varied and savoury  the pierogi prepared two ways also distinct and worth going back for another plate of soon. Give it a shot  have a couple excellent cocktails and enjoy a well prepared meal in a fun space with some friends', 'Great dining options for big family events or a semi-formal dinner for two. It has a pleasing looking bar with great decorations through the restaurant. The customer service is exceptional. The stuffed vegan pirogies were to die for! Amazing flavors and textures that fill your taste buds. I would recommend to another friend.', ""What a cool place  simple but clean and inviting decor  and amazing food.\nI love how casual it is  and yet the food is prepared with a gourmet care that was unexpected and exciting. Cocktails were also quite good.\n\nI'm so excited to see Pittsburgh exploring some of its Eastern European roots through its foodie lens!"", 'So amazing. Polish vegan food was something I never sought out to try but wow it did not disappoint.\n\nTwo entrees  dessert and cocktails split between me and a friend for $40. It as incredibly worth it. The service was friendly and great too. I will definitely be back.', ""Wonderful vegan cuisine at a fare price and good atmosphere. Unique place to take visitors or go on a date. \nI went twice in one week. First  with a group of people and then we went back with visitors to Pittsburgh. The food is delicious and unique and I am typically a picky eater/not vegan. I enjoyed every dish we had. Do not miss the pirogi's or mushroom/miso dish."", ""This place absolutely blew me away! I'm not vegan or vegetarian but sometimes a girl just needs to take a break from the meat in this town! Am I right?! Well anyway the atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired. With all the food joints piping up in Pittsburgh it's not hard to notice that killer food  drinks  and service are preferred to those places that focus singularly on the mood lighting. So happy this place decided to turn all of their focus on putting together amazing dishes. The potatoes were my favorite and the drinks were interestingly light which both filled me up and started a good buzz. If you need a break from the exorbitant amount of steak  burgers  and salads with French fries then check this out."", 'Get there early so you get a seat. You order at the counter which can be slightly intimidating. The cashiers are extremely helpful in describing the foods. The food combinations seem odd at first but taste surprisingly wonderful. My favorites are the special sandwich and the baba jaga. Everything is yummy though! Also a positive is that most of the foods seem pretty healthy. Sizes are substatial/filling. Atmosphere is trendy/hipster. Reminds me of some of the European places visited by Anthony Bourdain. Definitely give this place a shot and be open minded about the dishes. Good to sample a few all at once!', ""This place serves inventive and savory food inspired by  I believe  Polish cuisine. They have pierogies  lots of dishes with cabbage. That's a vegan restaurant in rustic style  but unlike some vegan restaurants this one doesn't serve processed replacements of cheese and such. Instead they create their own recipes and achieve great combinations. Definitely  a unique place."", ""Best vegan food in this area! A relaxing casual atmosphere  with friendly  prompt servers and interesting  tasty options. We had the perogis  which came with both potato and radish filling  and a luke warm vegetable soup with potato dumplings. Both were fantastic! Good texture and unique flavor.\n\nWe ordered dessert as well before finding out about a vegan bakery only a few blocks away  and the staff happily cancelled our order with no friction whatsoever. If I'm ever back in Pittsburgh I'll definitely come again."", 'Apteka - it\'s vegan  but you can barely tell! \n\nThe Food\nThis is a vegan establishment  but the food is so interesting you will be satisfied. \nGet the perogies because this is Pittsburgh  and because I told you to. \nFor real  they have a regular menu and a ""late night"" menu  all of which is excellent; fresh ingredients  flavorful  and DELICIOUS. \nThe perogie hoagie is my personal favorite- literal perogies and sauce and sauerkraut ON A FREAKING HOAGIE BUN. But real talk  you have to be ""on another level"" to eat it. \nThe 4 perogies are enough to fill up anyone. They come with a mix of types of perogies with beets on the side. Fresh to DEATH. \nThe bar at this establishment is also excellent. They feature a number of drafts (rotating) from local breweries. They also have a full bar with a list of signature cocktails. \n\nThe Staff\nThe staff is super helpful and great at explaining the unique dishes. They\'re also great to suggest a good beer or cocktail. \nThey also work well as a team here  feel free to ask anyone for anything and they will oblige. And no one is below a 7. (I said it.)\n\nThe Ambience\nThings at Apteka are done cafe style. So  come in  order  sit at a seat of your choosing  and the staff brings your order to you. Good for small groups  because there\'s no worries about splitting checks- it\'s done UPFRONT. Larger groups can be accommodated  too  but seats together depend on the crowd that night. \nThe decor is minimal in nature- perhaps a bit too much for my tastes. The walls are cement and the ceiling is open  but I imagine a little more will come with time. \nThere are definitely hipsters left and right  I mean  look at the hood  so if you detest their type  stay away. HOWEVER  dope ppl of ALL ages come here  young to late 70s.', 'Very neat spot. Light and airy; small and quiet. Nice music. Good vegan food and unique cocktails. The staff is nice and friendly. Very relaxing', ""Wow - astonishing experience. I reserve 5-star reviews for life-changing experiences  and maybe give 1 a year on average. For creativity  quality  vibe  service  uniqueness  and modest prices  Apteka is right there. I really didn't believe the Pgh foodie thing was real till my meal was served here. The full menu and the beer reflect this standard. There are professional reviews out there  and I won't try to replicate them. My advice is simple: go here."", ""Very surprised by how much I enjoyed my meal there.  Not that I heard poor things about Apteka-- in fact  the opposite as my son has been saying great things about the food-- but  rather  I've never eaten at a vegan restaurant before.\n\nA couple of us had the kluski  my wife had the pierogies  someone had a sandwich.  The menu is pretty limited but changes all the time-- yet we all left there very pleased with what we ate!  Plus I had an interesting tequila-based cocktail that was great.  Very surprised how tasty and satisfying vegan food could be (no offense meant to any vegans or vegetarians reading this).\n\nThe restaurant is Eastern European  so it was nice to hear the gentleman behind the bar pronounce my Polish last name correctly-- then let me know that they do serve stinging nettle (what my name means) tea!\n\nWe sat in the rear half of the restaurant which had a  patio feel.  A nice space to eat and talk.\n\nHad a lovely meal and look forward to my next visit there."", 'Probably the tastiest vegan food in Pittsburgh. Pierogi were the obvious highlight  the smoked potato and parsnip being especially noteworthy. We also got a giant salad full of herbs and baby kale with tasty homemade bread on the side. The food is seasoned so well you do not miss the butter! \n\nOnly drawback was the difficulty in reading the menu  which is posted pretty close to the door. A few paper copies to pick and read while you wait in line to order would be helpful.', ""They have a few kinks to work out (like accepting too many people in the door and not having enough tables) but overall OMG.\n\nI'm not a vegetarian  so I wasn't over-the-moon about trying this place out  but it will probably quickly become one of my favorites.  \n\nFor food I've had (so far):  Pierogis (yum!)  the baba jaga (fantastic sandwich and heavy); my favorite - kartofle (potato apple lingonberry yogurt)  and the vegetarian special sandwich (not my favorite).  Everythign is really well made  and you don't go home hungry!\n\nKnow before you go:  Craft cocktails are different and you have to go with an open mind  also  you will line up at the door  place your order  be handed a number and then go sit (Panera style)- this can be a bit awkward as you can have a number and possibly not a table?!"", ""I am in complete disbelief that such a great  unusual new restaurant has opened in Bloomfield. When a friend and I checked it out  we were VERY hungry  and had somewhat low expectations (sign looked a bit sketchy out front  we weren't sure if we even liked eastern European food). I could not have been more wrong! The interior has a hip  grungy vibe  that is reminiscent of the old country - a little eastern soviet blockade feel to it. The servers and bartenders are so cool  and if you're lucky  take a moment to chat with them. \n\nThe concept is pretty cool - you order at the bar  cafeteria style  then pick a table. They bring you your drinks and food. The drinks are magnificent and the pricing is excellent for Pittsburgh (average drinks $6-9). I ordered a gin drink with citrus and celery salt which is now my favorite gin drink of all time. My buddy ordered a campari and vodka based concoction that was not too sweet  but tasted of freshly juiced black cherries.\n\nWe ordered the large plate of pierogies and the trio of open faced tartines. The bread on the open faced sandwiches was dark and crusty  clearly home-made  and reminded me inescapably of happy childhood days baking dark bread with my family. The toppings were great - one had chopped seasoned root vegetables  one was some sort of tapenade  and the final one was pickled radishes and cucumbers over another tomato tapenade. Each one was unique and delicious. Then came the pierogies. Utter. Perfection. They were fried  which gave the nicest crunch when you bit in. There are two types they make - sauerkraut and mushroom (a little spicy with pepper)  and potato. Both were incredible  and had layers of flavor that made me want to order three more plates. Honestly  I would have never even known it was a vegan restaurant if I hadn't looked it up ahead of time. I never missed meat once  and barely noticed there was none present. \n\nAfter all of this food  we sadly didn't have any appetite for dessert. However  I am confident I'll be back. And soon! This place is heating up and I can only imagine that the sky will be the limit for them. \n\nTwo pierogie covered thumbs up!"", ""Takes vegetarian to a whole new level!  The food is terrific with a good menu option. This is as casual as it gets  with ordering at the counter and then it's brought up you.

All times were amazing! \n\nIt is sorta in the middle of nowhere - a standalone restaurant  across a cemetery. The ambience is quite... hipster (it's a vegan place for pete sake) and calming. Its layout reminds me a bit of a brighter version of Noodlehead with the large water jugs and seating arrangements.\n\nIt's a great place to hold a small to medium sized event  as you can book the whole restaurant. The service is great too. During the banquet  they were very accomodating and we even received table to table service from the servers!\n\nThe food comes out timely and is sooo good.

I wanted to order the pirogies but couldn\'t as I\'m a person who doesn\'t like mushrooms and they were not able to separate the varieties -- bummer. I did order a sandwich with beets and it was a-m-a-z-i-n-g. That said  it was just the sandwich and I left still needing to eat more. I didn\'t realize it wouldn\'t come with at least a side salad for the $9 price tag. Even up the price to include a salad or side. \n\nThe atmosphere was casual and great other than the smokiness that kept circulating the room. My jacket still smells. :(', 'Have been here several times and have always loved what I have gotten (the borsht is so good!)! Cocktails are really delicious and soo cheap. Beautiful  simple decor as unisex bathrooms.', ""Incredible pierogies! Very chill  hip vegan place. Can't wait to continue to go back until I've tried everything on the menu. Very cool bar area as well for drinks or to sit at and dine."", ""Friendly service  beautiful garden patio and most importantly absolutely delicious and unique food. We had several dishes and enjoyed them all but the Boczniaki z kapusta was my favorite. The cocktails were unlike any I've had before - I highly recommend the Becherovka and Slivovitz.  Hands down - this is one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh."", ""Tried this place last night and it BLEW MY MIND. Every single thing I tried was delightful and innovative and just straight up delicious -- though it was visions of pierogi that danced in my head last night. They are amazing!! The dough is so perfect and the filling so scrumptious. \n\nThe space is inviting and pleasant and the staff are all so friendly and enthusiastic. You can feel how invested everyone is in this awesome venture. \n\nRun don't walk! I live in Brooklyn or I would be here every damn day."", ""I've been wanting to try this place since its inception and finally made my way. We ordered the soup  the special sandwich  and the pyrogies (spelling?) - all to split. The only downfall of this place is that I saw two menus - one on the wall and one on the counter. I can't tell you what  the soup I had  nor the pyrogies we had. We tried to determine what was in each item as we bit into it  but it was nearly impossible hence the reason I would've loved to reference the menu as we dined. Anyways  it's a vegetarians paradise  nothing was off limits. The sandwich was a little earthy  but the aioli or vinegarette helped to balance the flavor. Pyrogies were absolutely  positively amazing. Slightly browned on the outside  beautifully flavored in every aspect. \nPrice wise it was on point.  $37 for soup  big pyrogie plate  nice size sandwich  Dales Pale Ale  bottle of sparkling water. No complaints there."", ""Cool place--some of the reviews made it sound like it is pretentious (pretentious Polish food? ha!)  but it is totally cool and the workers are happy to answer any questions you may have.  Mixed age/ethnicity diners  but yeah it is not super cheap.  I had not had polish food before  if you don't count some random borsht and cabbage rolls.  I had the pierogies and the kluski.  Very interesting and tasty!  Kluski comes with a mushed up bean puree kinda deal--good flavor.   Several cabbage type veggies on top  some bitter  some not.  Cute little dumplings that are fun to eat.  There were two kinds of pierogies in the 4 pack  but honestly  I wasn't really listening.  One was more peppery and had cabbage.  Other was more potato-y but also maybe had cabbage.  They came with some crema type stuff on top  cucumber pickles  and beet salad.  My favorite things were the pickles  beets  and beans.  I also had a fancy gin drink which was good but kinda just tasted like a tom collins.  Price was $29 for everything plus a tip for bartender.  Dinner plus ap was enough for 2 not so hungry people or one hungry person.    Would def return!"", ""I was really looking forward to this place! I actually even donated to the Kickstarter and was so excited to go. The music was weird but the food was fine. We got the pierogis and ate a bunch of them when my boyfriend's throat started itching. He's allergic to cashews and they were not listed on the menu. \n\nWe booked it home to grab meds  so thank god we live close. I can't eat dairy and was so excited for a dietary conscious restaurant...but i guess it's only conscious for some of us.\n\nThe two stars are because the food was pretty good and they seemed apologetic. They just need to start listing their allergens moving forward."", 'I guess when you\'re a vegan restaurant it\'s important that people know you\'re a vegan restaurant.  You know...so the vegans know how to find you.  And...bear with me here...that makes sense.  But Apteka isn\'t a good vegan restaurant.  Or...perhaps it\'s more accurate to say instead  Apteka isn\'t JUST a good VEGAN restaurant.  It\'s a good restaurant.  Yeah...there\'s no meat on the menu.  Or...you know...dairy or eggs or fish and stuff. \n\nSo I suppose if you\'re dining with someone that REQUIRES meat.  Like...like Count Dracula for example.  If you and the Count are dining  this is a bad selection.  But apart from Count Dracula  or other people...like those too hidebound to attempt something with the ""Vegan"" label...this is a good restaurant.  No additional qualifiers required.\n\nSecondly...I sampled four cocktails from their bar.  All from the menu (before you think  ugh  Jesus  Jim  not another drunk review...one of the drinks was just a taste of my date\'s drink).  And they were each better than the last.  REALLY well balanced nicely thought out drinks.  Can\'t really go wrong.  \n\nThe pierogies were excellent.  The tartines were superb.  The Boczniaki z kapusta was good  not great...the cabbage was a little clunky to eat.  It resisted my efforts to cut it into mouthful sized pieces.  The flavors were nice though.  We capped our evening with the ""special sandwich"".  We just saw it pass our table too many times not to give it a try.  It didn\'t disappoint.\n\nOur server was a menacing looking fellow all betatted and armful with a perpetual scowl.  Which sounds like a bad thing  but if you asked him a question he would just light up like a kid at christmas and tell you ALL THE THINGS  beaming and gushing and very knowledgable and the contrast was so friggin\' delightful that I kept asking him stuff to watch him transform over and over from menacing to kid-at-christmas and back again.\n\nProbably the biggest criticism I have to the place is that it\'s lit in a way that is not conducive to artful pictures.  You know we MUST have pictures of our food.  And no matter which way we positioned glasses or seats or plates...there was always some weird shadow.  \n\nWork on it  Apteka.  The people must post.\n\nAnyway...I\'ll be back.  Meat or no meat.', 'This place is excellent.  I came here for dinner last week with a large group of friends. We basically ordered 2 of everything on the menu.  Everything was good but the highlights were (1) the mushroom pierogis; (2) the pumpkin and fennel seed soup; and (3) the oyster mushrooms with cabbage.  The cocktails are also excellent! (I had two frenets and scotch).\n\nMy only real critique is that all of the dishes came out at once which was a little overwhelming.  I would have liked the waiter to tell us to stagger our order so that things came out in courses.  Otherwise this place is perfect!', ""The pierogies here are truly excellent. My go-to place with my vegan friend.\nThe food ordering is a bit untraditional.  You have to order at the counter when you walk in and find a table. So far we always showed up early and haven't had to stand in line to wait for a table. The desert is not my cup of tea. When we ordered 'Rich cream cake' we expected something creamy. \nIt is super dry  and I think the name is very misleading."", ""These folks have worked their way up from an all-you-can eat monthly pop up dinner to Apteka. The food is delicious  all vegan Eastern European(i.e. Polish/Hungarian). It's hard to make good vegan stuffed cabbage and pierogi but they have done it. The borscht is incredible; subtle yet full of flavor. The cocktails are also very good  they pair a lot of unique and offbeat flavors.  The ambiance is simple and inviting  the lighting is good and the space is enjoyable to be in. Large crowds gather on weekend nights so anticipate long lines at those times.  I love this place and will go back again and again."", 'It seems to be busy and while tables are full they hand us our glass liter of water and glasses. Along with our plates and silverware. Theres no where to sit so i ask if im supposed to just hold our entire dinner table they handed to us and wait until food comes out with no where to go. Why they didnt care at all or have a method of dealing with situations like these are beyond me. If anything they were very rude even. They didnt care at all and i left unhappy after already tipping them while ordering. Horrible service.', 'Full disclaimer: I\'m not vegan.\n\nHowever  I think good food is good food and I am willing to try anything once. I\'ve heard a lot of great things about Apteka and see it recommended on many Pittsburgh ""late-night eats"" and ""best perogies"" lists. I just so happened to be craving perogies at 10pm on a Thursday night and decided to give it a try. I dragged my (also not a vegan) brother with me. The interior was warm and inviting on a cold November night. They definitely embraced the earthy elements with lots of floral and plants as decor. \n\nYou order at the counter when you walk-in  we were working with the late night menu  which is a little more limited  so we both ordered the highly recommended perogies. My brother had a beer from a local brewery and I ordered a vodka cocktail. It was made with sunflower oil and some sort of flower (possibly a dandelion) floating in it. It was honestly one of the best vodka cocktails I\'ve had in my life (my brother tasted and agreed). To be completely honest  I didn\'t eat the floating flower. \n\nUnpopular opinion... I just didn\'t get the hype. The perogies  had lots of flavor like people previously mentioned  I just can\'t say that I enjoyed the flavor. There appeared to be two different types of perogies one that was better (in my opinion) than the other. Menu says... Sauerkraut + mushroom . Celeriac + apple + potato + horseradish. The Mushroom perogies were definitely the ones I didn\'t like  they just had this overpowering shroom flavor that left an unpleasant almost ""dirt"" aftertaste.\n\nApparently if you\'re a vegan this food is amazing  I\'m clearly not cut out for that life. Neither of us even finished our meals and it was about $40 for the two drinks and the perogies. I\'d come back for another vodka cocktail  but I don\'t foresee any food orders in my future.', ""Apteka is a unique restaurant featuring Eastern European vegan cuisine. As a carnivore  I can assure anyone with taste for good food  that they're culinary desires will  be satisfied. Despite the description of the cuisine  which might seem limiting -- there's actually a decent size menu that offers a variety of tastes and options that range from light to very filling. Remember that vegan doesn't mean gluten-free  so there's plenty of carbs available from dumplings in a delicious carrot broth (Kluski Slaskie) to pierogies with fun fillings to veggie sandwiches on rich bread. As a bonus  this casual and comfortable yet hip eatery is open late nights with a more limited  but still delicious menu. There's a full bar with some clever cocktails  craft beers and a small selection of interesting wines. Service is simple with ordering done at the counter just inside the front door  take your carafe of water and order number  choose a table and it won't be long before your picture perfect food arrives. Customer sitting at the bar can have an open tab  thus replicating full table service. The staff appears to be young and ambitious  taking pride in their craft."", ""Never have I been to a place that changed my perspective on vegan fare quite like Apteka. \n\nWe stumbled across this restaurant with some friends on a Monday night and there was already a line our the door about 9 PM. This place does not look like much from the outside but the interior is very relaxed  dimly lit and an intimate atmosphere for share plates and drinks I've never heard of. Instead of waiting in the line to be sat  we met someone pretty cool to share a table with that led to great conversation and a good night!\n\nThere was a live DJ at one of the tables playing some low-key background music but it was a nice touch.\n\nBut the real highlight of Apteka was the amazing food! Lots of good options and all delicious. Nothing lacks flavor and the pierogi's were the best vegan plate I've had! You'd be missing out if you didn't try some. YUM  I'll be back but check it out if you find yourself out this way!"", ""I visited this place twice while visiting from California.  I loved the drinks!  They were creative and refreshing and there were some great options for those of us who love fruity and sweet drinks.  The atmosphere was fun and relaxed and the bartender was nice.  I didn't try much food but what I did try was delicious.  I'm not a vegan  but I can appreciate a vegan cuisine from time to time.  If I lived in the area  I'd definitely visit this place often!"", ""Vegan Polish food sounded like a good joke to me  but they really make it work. Brought my mom here to blow her mind and show here that meatless life is possible even if you're Polish.\nPoppy seed soda and pepper soda - only soda I'll ever accept!"", ""Interesting concept and menu. This was my first time coming here. You order at the counter (which can take a while if they are busy) and then sit at the tables. Everything is Vegan  which isn't really my forte but a group of us from work wanted to try it. Ordering was a little hard because a lot of the items  I've never heard of or don't know how to pronounce. The staff was helpful in giving suggestions as well. There was another group in front of us that was in the same boat as well  so we weren't the only ones! I played it safe and went with the pierogis. I also sampled the Kluski Slaskie (potato dumplings)  Placki ziemniaczane z paprika (potato pancakes)  and Boczniaki z kapusta (mushroom and cabbage). Everything was tasty. The mushroom pierogis were spicy  which I wasn't expecting but still enjoyed them. Everything else was good and flavorful as well. I feel you have to have a certain palate for this kind of food though. A lot of the ingredients I'm not familiar with or don't really like. But I'm glad I tried it. I wouldn't come here all the time but it's something different."", 'SO OVERRATED! \n\nOkay  so I will stop shouting now. But seriously  I am missing out on what the thing is about this place. I am a vegetarian and looked forward to eating here  but the food and ambience both disappointed.\n\nI had Kartofle and a Special Sandwich. The Kartofle was potatoes with lingonberries and some yogurt. It was fine  nothing special  a side dish that became my main course because...\n\nThe Special Sandwich was ""special"" in the way that means ""not good"". I think they were going for crusty baguette for the bread  but it was tooth-breaking levels of hard. Look  I bake bread  I know the difference between crusty and hard  and this was just hard  like it was stale or something. And the filling was bland and heavy  no discernible flavor.\n\nI don\'t understand why they don\'t just have table service like every other restaurant in their price range. You come in and have to wait in a line that hits the door  so you\'re immediately not comfortable  you give your order to a person  and then you hope you find a seat  and maybe you don\'t sometimes? I was there on a Sunday so I didn\'t have an issue. We sat in the carport  which had appallingly bright lighting. Our table was sticky. We tried to clean it with water  but that didn\'t help. The benches were uncomfortable. It\'s like they want you to eat and leave fast (though nobody rushed us out; just the ambience screamed ""GET OUT OF HERE FAST"").\n\nThat said  my cocktail was just fine and the staff seemed friendly and efficient.', ""Have to admit  the vegan scene here in Pittsburgh is really starting to mature and to come off the ground. It's really quite nice to be a part of such a healthy food movement that's been taking the city by craze & Apteka is no different. A vegan establishment in the Bloomfield area near Children's  this is a great place to go for some great tasting vegan food  snacks  drinks  and a good time at the bar (if that's your thing lol). Tried the Kartofle z jogurtem (a Polish-inspired yogurt appetizer) and I was surprised at the rather novel but delightful combination of sweet & savory with the potato & apple in the same dish. The yogurt smoothed both flavors out & made things interesting. However  I would really write home about the pierogis  which are absolutely bomb here. The dish has a combo of sauerkraut + mushroom along with celeriac + apple + potato + horseradish pierogis  but I'd have to say that the sauerkraut + mushroom is the better of the two  though both are equally great-tasting (only my preference  take my opinion with a grain of salt). There are also lots of alcohol choices available at the bar (wine & beer). Don't be afraid to ask the bartenders what you're looking for in your drink as they are quite knowledgeable  friendly  and willing to help. In general  a lovely addition of a restaurant to Bloomfield. Would highly recommend a visit."", ""Restaurant is a inconspicuous brick flat on the outside  but screams hipster chic on the inside. You order at the counter from a paper menu on the wall. The food is brought to your table. The prices are very reasonable given my perceived quality of the food.\n\nCompared to the few other vegan dining opportunities I've had in the past  the food here was a huge step up. From a personal enjoyment perspective  I don't think this was a enjoyable experience (Pierogi  Kluski Slaskie  and salad) at all due to the general blandness of the food. I just cannot get over how little I enjoyed the food here. Perhaps my subconscious carnivore was sabotaging my taste buds throughout the experience.\n\nIf you are vegan or a full time vegetarian  I doubt you'll find many places better and cooler than this. But if you are a career omnivore (or carnivore)  I wouldn't consider this a destination restaurant for you."", ""I do not understand how ANY review of this place is less than 5 stars!?!??

The staff always makes me feel welcome. \nThe guy you order from at the front is maybe one of the best customer service experiences I've ever had. EVERY TIME!  His consistency with every customer is so impressive.  He knows the menu and guides you through the experience so well.  Their head bartender is a wizard.

The late night menu is EVERYTHING. Their klasyk burger is to die for  the fries with the mayo is delicious  boyfriend still gets the special sandwich every time and he loves their perogies.\n\n\nTonight was my second time here with my boyfriend. The first time we were here we just came for dessert and shared an apple tart which was absolutely amazing! So we decided then that we would have to come back for dinner one of these nights  and tonight was the night! We ordered the special sandwich  the perogies and the second salad on the menu (can't remember the name but it had a 2 next to it.) Going into the night I was most excited about the perogies  but truthfully the special sandwich and the second salad stole the show! I love the type of bread that the sandwich is served on  and the yumminess inside of the sandwich had a perfect kick of spice to the flavor I will absolutely be ordering again. The salad had an amazing dill type dressing which made it so tasty! The perogies were still impressive and they had a nice crispiness to them :) we skipped out on dessert this time though since we ordered so much food; next time though :)"", ""Wow! I wasn't so sure when we walked in and had to order at the counter and then sit down  but I WAS WRONG! Everything  from the cocktails to the entrees to the sandwiches were conceived and created with care  attention to detail  and authenticity. Everything was DELICIOUS. Oh and btw everything is vegetarian and vegan-adaptable  but ya won't miss the meat let me tell you! Na zdrowie!"", ""This is a great restaurant whether you're vegan/vegetarian or not..period. The only ones I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to would be picky eaters who like to stick with familiar flavors and textures. I absolutely loved the two cocktails I tried (tequila+wildflower+citrus and rum+juniper+draai laag)... way better than some fancier and more expensive restaurants I've reviewed. And the food.. oh my.. I had the Boczniaki z kapusta which is oyster mushroom + braised cabbage in beer broth + butternut miso + rye crumb and a small Zimowa salad which had porcini vin + pickled beet + roast turnip + pea shoots + mint toast. I must confess  nothing was familiar about the flavors and the textures and their combination. Even the greens in the salad were unique and not the kind you'd see in the average salad. But the melange was outstanding. I'd strongly recommend the salad. I was full by then but couldn't not try the pierogies. And that ended up being the best decision I took that day. Just look at the list of what goes into the pierogies - Sauerkraut + mushroom . Celeriac + apple + potato + horseradish. Not you're average joe pierogi for sure! Do not miss trying them. The only thing that was slightly annoying was that the ordering is cafe style..and that ends up being a bottleneck. I made the mistake of ordering my first drink.. then had to go back to stand in line to order my appetizer.. and then again for my second drink and entre.. and then AGAIN for the afterthought pierogi! The fact that the menu is full of lovely  exotic and unpronounceable dishes/ingredients and so everyone has several questions before ordering and contributes to the bottleneck in the line. So you might want to consider pulling up the menu on your phone (because the only copy is taped to the bar counter) and ordering all your food and drinks at once when you get to the counter. Slightly inconvenient.. but saves you the awkwardness of waiting in line for 15 minutes to order your next drink while your date is waiting at the table. But line or not  I'm definitely going back to try the rest of the menu."", ""My favorite new restaurant anywhere in the United States. Each experience has been blessedly pleasant at Apteka.  the food is absolutely brilliant. The staff is great.

It's a tiny miracle that the place exists and it's gratifying to see they have been successful so far.

I dig the laid back but classy atmosphere. There were fresh bouquets of flowers around the restaurant  felt big  great lighting and because of how hot it was they opened the back garage door to let a nice breeze flow through. The menu is up on the wall when you enter Apetka and you order at the counter right next to it. I wish the ""Order Here"" sign was bigger for people like me - I missed it totally and thought we would be served at our table but luckily my husband saw it when we first came in. I would have been sitting at our table awaiting menus for much longer... We had 4 pierogis  baba jaga and kanapki  all of which were delicious. The baba jaga is a substantial sandwich. I had a beer and my husband had the bourbon cocktail. I don\'t normally like bourbon but I liked this cocktail however my husband thought it wasn\'t bourbon-y enough for him.

Apteka has done an amazing job creating awesome plates that really highlight how great vegan food can be.\nThe pumpkin soup was a great starter and the pierogis are on point. They are not your traditional potato-cabbage-cheese pierogis. They are unique and have great flavor combinations. They are smaller plates and make for super easy sharing between people. We ordered three different things and shared them between two people. Plenty of food for the both of us.\nIt is important to be aware that this is not a traditional sit-down restaurant. It is more of a bistro that requires you to order prior to taking a seat. They menu is listed on a huge wall next to the counter for all to see. The atmosphere is also very calm and welcoming.

We walked in to an extremely confusing layout. We stood in the doorway for a while and nothing happened and then went up to the counter as a line formed behind us. The girl taking orders was just as confused as us and asked us what we wanted but we were trying to get a table and she just took the next person in line instead of giving us a number. She must have been brand new. So we went to the back of the line and waited again. We ordered  paid  and realized that there were no seats! We walked over to the bar and a couple happened to be getting up  so we sat down. They never took away the drinks and checks from the previous couple. We got our food pretty soon after we ordered  both appetizers and main courses at once. The food was very bitter to the point where it was actually spicy and burning my mouth. We packaged it up and left soon after we started eating.

I have not liked any of the deserts I\'ve tried and feel as if the desserts really seem ""vegan."" Nothing else at this restaurant has been disappointing for me and I\'ve tried almost everything they\'ve offered on multiple different seasonal menus.\n\nWe most recently brought four friends here and we ordered *everything* to share  except for dessert and the two soups they were offering at the time. And again everything was delicious. \n\nThe sandwiches have always been my favorite and often times include very interesting and wonderful veggie pate. I\'ve also had their pirogies every time I\'ve been to Apteka and I\'ve never missed sour cream. During this last visit we ordered both salads and I was pleasantly surprised with the unique flavors each salad offered. \n\nLast  but not least favorite thing about Apteka- their cocktails. I have tried at least 5-6 different cocktails and would recommend any of them. They are consistently refreshing and delicious. Perfectly made in a way that they are very drinkable but are not boring or too sweet. \n\nOverall  Apteka is wonderful. It\'s great for most people  even if you\'re usually a meat eater.

I've tried several things on their ever-changing menu  and nothing has disappointed. The cocktails are always a pleasant surprise.

Started with a Pittsburgh fav - pierogis  but vegan style with greens  mushrooms and spices. Topped with a tangy sauce  scallions  and shredded beets. They were good and the price was fair. Endive with prunes and mushrooms was a tasty starter. Not something you'll find on other local menus. My favorite dish was the lentil stuffed cabbage in a zesty tomato sauce with crispy cabbage on the side. All dishes had a classic foundation with a vegan and crafty touch. Topped off the meal with a bourbon  plum  and sage cocktail. Not as strong as is like but tasty.

My friend and I split a number of dishes and they were all SO GOOD.\n\nWe started with the Kanapki which is esentially a few different spreads on toast. My favorite of these was the roast carrot pure which was so delicious!!\n\nThen we moved onto the Boczniaki z kapusta which was beer braised cabbage with butternut miso and rye crumb. OMG that butternut miso was SO GOOD  we were practically licking the plate. That whole dish was probably my favorite.\n\nNext was the Salatka with smoked chilli  burnt carrot  sunflower shoots  and burnt sunflower seeds. I had no idea that so many burnt things could add up to such a delicious dish. I guess I need to burn my food more often. \n\nFor dessert we split both the apple tart and the yogurt bilberry. The yogurt was made of cashews! I've never tried nut yogurt before so this was really exciting! I liked both dishes a lot though the apple tart I liked more. We also each got a fancy soda (I had the wildflower soda and my friend had the poppy seed soda).\n\nAfter all that each of us only paid $22! Such a deal for such an amazing meal! I will definitely be back next time I'm in Pittsburgh!"", ""Imagine yourself in your dark garage  music blasting  surrounded by hipsters and candle light. Okay it's trendy  I get it. Still tho ordering at the bar in single file line  yelling over the DJ  isn't the most effective food service. And for what they charge per dish  they can afford to turn on a few more lights in the place. Candle light wasn't cutting it. This isn't the 1700s. Vegans couldn't survive back then.\n That being said cocktails are pretty good."", ""Let start by saying I am not a vegan and have no desire to become one.  I love me some cheese.  (I do eat like a vegetarian 95% of the time since I generally don't enjoy the taste of most meats.)\n\nThat said  Apteka is incredible.  A vegan pal convinced a few of us to go on a Friday after work and we were skeptical.  However  we all immensely enjoy our meals.  And now I'm hooked.  The pierogies are amazing.  Amazing.  Let me say it one more time: amazing.\n\nThe cocktails are all unique with a great balance of flavors.  The bartenders here definitely take the time to create something fresh and delicious.  I've now tried the full list except for the gin (I'm allergic).  The vodka  black currant  vermouth  and burnt lemon cocktail is my favorite.\n\nThe service is excellent.  The decor is cool.  The prices are very reasonable.  The bathrooms are in a weird spot and a larger exterior sign would be nice  but it's totally worth a visit...or six."", ""I know what you are thinking  vegan Polish food? But rest assured this is some of the tastiest food I've ever eaten-vegan or not. The menu rotates a bit seasonally  but the tartines and pierogis are always a stellar option."", 'I came here at exactly 5 after hearing how crowded it can get.  I had both of my baby boomer parents who were slightly lost by the menu.  They had the baba jaga sandwiches  I had the borscht and we split the big plate of pierogi.  The cup of borscht was small but truly excellent.  The pierogi was great and my parents enjoyed their meal.', ""I can't wait to go back! I only got drinks and desert but it was a stellar experience and I'm stoked to go back!"", 'Not too busy on a Thursday at 9 PM. I had the half salad with smoked chili vinaigrette and pierogies again (too good). I highly recommend this savory yet light salad. The sunflower seeds added a nice crunch and the burnt carrot lining the bowl complemented the dish well. I was scraping the sides to get it all! I also tried the gin  prosecco  pear  and hops cocktail. Delicious - not too strong nor too sweet.', ""My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh and I'm not a vegan. I have had Pierogi  Kluski Slaskie  and the Baba Jaga and I would recommend all. Definitely get an order of Piergois. You won't be disappointed. \n\nCocktails are also good. Prices are more than reasonable. Good service."", 'Gourmet vegan without pretension in the food or setting. What an incredible culinary experience . I have never anywhere on this planet had such an extraordinary vegan meal  with combinations of flavors and textures that were really utterly terrific. We all talked about the meal trying to figure out why it was so good-every single dish was a swirl of melding and related flavors and we shared about 10! I think it came down to this: the foundation of almost each dish is a classic recognizable food item you know   like a dense potato pancake or a pierogi but the fillings and dough  add other ingredients that work  and the sauces (the sauces  o the sauces  just way beyond Wow)  well  yes   you will lick your plates even if your upbringing strictly forbade such vile behavior. And  why it all works is simple: this is not (Con)fusion cooking by some full of herself chef who throws together flavors from different traditions just because. These flavor and texture combinations are pure art (and no doubt endless hours in the kitchen of finding out how things go together). Then beyond these dishes there are some very unique choices. A sunflower head last night. For some (me)  just not imaginable to eat that  for others at our table  an unimaginable delight.  Then there were other dishes that are simply beyond my ability to describe in any specific detail at all beyond that oyster mushrooms were involved - a combination of vegetables  dressings  sauces  burnt offerings  melted down jewels  ground up ambrosia . Just beyond anything I have seen or eaten anywhere. And then even  the potato salad and carrot salads were a revelation. Again  based on something familiar but made into something much much more. Without pretension  with passion.  And after you have had the sour cherry pierogi (after which I could have just rolled over  said thank you O Lord for allowing me to have a vegan child who moved to Pittsburgh   and I would have blissfully left the planet)   then   then  ask about the desserts . Do not say you are too full. We shared the ciastro gruska cake. I am at a loss for words.  \n\nAnd I am not even a vegan.', 'I can\'t figure out if this place is popular because it\'s vegan... or because it\'s Polish... Because I assure you  it is neither of those things! Wait  I should rephrase that because it is vegan Polish food  but if you\'re looking for traditional  (which is not vegan)  look somewhere else.  I was blown away by the modern Polish take on food and apparently  so is the rest of Pittsburgh because the whole place was packed.\n\nAs you walk in  they have the menu on a the wall and you order at the register. The cocktails are a must! We coined them ""grown up juice"" because they\'re simply amazing drinks that happen to be alcoholic.  \n\nWe ordered three plates to split and one Apple tarte to end with.  They recommended we order dessert in the beginning and once we finish dinner  tell the  server who collects the plates and they\'ll bring dessert out afterwards. Once you order  you find a table. They have a back room that looks like a converted one car garage  that adds a lot more seating. Once we got our food  we chowed down. Everything was delicious. I\'m not from Pittsburgh  but if go back just for this restaurant.', ""My husband and I finally got around to breaking our B52 habit and tried Apteka. After all of the amazing things that we kept hearing  we figured it was finally time.\n\nTo start - we tried the potato dumplings and the pierogis. (This will be the extent of me knowing what I was eating.) Both were super delicious; and we followed the food runner's suggestion of eating the dumplings first  while they were still hot. The pierogis had a crunchy texture on the outside  and full of flavor on the inside.\n\nWe ordered two more small plates  but what we ordered - I cannot remember what they were called  nor do I really know what I was eating. But they were also pretty delicious. \n\nMy only disappointment is that I never experienced that roll-my-eyes-in-the-back-of-my-head kind of flavor or texture (my husband also agrees). Don't get me wrong - it was good; but not at the level that I felt that I was being hyped up for. Compared to some of our other favorites: B52  Onion Maiden  and Gluten Free Goat - where every thing on the menu is orgasmic - we didn't feel that way at Apteka. I also felt that the music selection was a little too avant garde to create a comfortable atmosphere. \n\nThat being said  we will still return when we're craving some salty and earthy potatoes; especially if it's late at night. The space is wonderfully simple and feels open with a community feel. It's a great addition to the Penn Ave food scene."", ""There are few vegan restaurants in Pittsburgh  this is one of maybe.....three? Ha.  But it's great! Very creative ways of making vegan food.  My only thing is  everything starts to taste very similar and all kinds look the same  I was bored after awhile.  Would still recommend to vegan visitors."", 'Love the food  the atmosphere  and the cocktails!  Probably the best food I have had in Pittsburgh. The chef is has a genius understanding of how to marry flavors.  The staff is very friendly and they have done such a great job with the space.  Highly highly recommended.', ""I have now been here twice and not eaten twice. The first time they told me the kitchen closed at 10pm  but when pressed for anywhere open after 10  I was told there was a pizza place a few miles away. So fucking helpful. \n\nThis time  I walked in and didn't know the drill. Apparently you crowd in at the bar and order then sit. Except no one would meet my eye and explain that. Or seat me. Or tell me to sit anywhere. Instead the waitstaff actively looked away when I tried to ask them for water. I had to look on Yelp to find out that this place had you order at the bar. No one  NO ONE in this pretentious hipster bar could actually practice customer service.\n\nFuck that. I get better service in Bushwick."", ""An amazing experience- delicious food  portions are just right  staff are friendly and patient  seating was lovely. On top of all that  my children said it's their favorite restaurant."", 'Loved Apteka! Not a vegan but had to come check it out and it did not disappoint. Favorite part was the Scotch with citrus notes and Fernet to enjoy at the end of the meal. Was an enjoyable dining experience as the staff seem to enjoy and take pride in their job and the atmosphere is casual and enjoyable.', ""Geez louise. I'm blown away. These pierogi are without a doubt the best I've ever had. Hand-made  browned perfectly  filled with fresh (vegan!) ingredients  and served with a tangy yogurt mustard sauce. And the portions! Well worth every penny.\n\nI also enjoy the fresh craft cocktails and craft beers available. My fave cocktail so far is the vodka with black currant and burnt lemon - full of flavor and refreshing.\n\nThe vibe at Apteka is laid-back  with mismatched chairs and minimal decor. You order at the bar and food/drinks are brought out to you (seat yourself)  which adds to the relaxed feel. Street parking is available on Penn Avenue. I see they now have a brightly-lit moniker out front so it's even easier to find.\n\nApteka will please your veg and carnivore friends alike  and I look forward to many more delicious meals there."", 'Food is incredibly flavorful. Atmosphere is laid back and cheerful. Staff have quick smiles and seem glad to be there. Cocktails are interesting and delicious. Not a vegan or even a vegetarian  and I was thoroughly satisfied and plan to come back.', ""We went in on Wednesday night based on Yelp reviews and the fact that it's a vegan restaurant. Holy moly was it busy! We got lucky and didn't have to wait for a table  but the place was packed and for a good reason. Both food and cocktails were amazing! We had pirogies (you have to) and golubki. It hit all the right spots! I'm not a vodka drinker  but vodka  black current and burnt lemon was refreshing and very tasty. Whether you're vegan or not  give this place a chance - you will not be disappointed!"", ""Brought a group of visitors here for dinner. They were very skeptical and very pleasantly surprised! \n\nWe managed somehow to get a reservation  which is good because ordinarily the seating process here stresses me out. I was also able to keep a tab open  which saved us from having to get back in line when we ordered more things.\n\nWe ordered some of everything except the soups and shared it all family style. Here were our favorites:\nBaba Jaga\nBoczniaki z kapusta\nPierogi\n\nThe Boczniaki z kapusta in particular was well-liked - I couldn't believe I wasn't eating meat. It has a very rich  savory flavor.\n\nWe also enjoyed several of the cocktails  which are decently strong and reasonably priced.\n\nOverall the whole meal was a success!"", 'This place is really unique and delicious.  I am a meat eater  but I like to eat as little as I can to help the environment more. This is one of the places that could convince me that I don\'t need to eat it at all.  They have super creative dishes that are homemade and tasty.  I\'ve been here twice now and only got one thing that a small disappointment (stuffed cabbage with bulgar wheat).  It\'s currently not on the menu  so I think they got enough feedback that it was just ""meh.""  On the latest visit we got the pierogis  tartines  both kinds of sandwiches (Baba Jaga and Special) and the kluski slaskie.   All were either very good or excellent.  Pierogis were definitely the favorite of the table.  The only quibble with the sandwiches were that they were messy to eat with hands (but so tasty!).  So I tried to cut and eat them and it was hard to cut the bread with a knife for some reason.  Our neighbors got the soup and they said it was delicious.  At the end  we had the Piernik dessert which was gingerbread with prune puree in the middle.  One of my friends thought it was too much prune (I think a personal preference).  I did not feel the same. I that it worked well together and was a great ending to a very different eating experience.  \n\nLogistics of the restaurant are a little different than normal sit down places.  You have to know what you want when you walk in and go to the counter to order.  Then they give you a number  you have to find a place to sit and your food is brought to you.  You still have a server who refills water  clears plates and brings you a box. I\'m not sure what would happen if you forgot to order something and wanted to add it.  Would you have to wait in line again or could your server add something on and charge you for it?  Probably because they also serve cocktails and beer so you might want to order more of those  but not sure.  My recommendation is go online and look at the menu  confirm that it\'s still on the board when you get there and order everything at beginning.  They won\'t bring your dessert until you ask for it which was nice.', 'Sooo good! Vegetarian  Polish food? Wow! I am hungry just think about it. Got Baba Jaga canapés and pierogi dish - mouthwatering. Great job!', ""Apteka is easily one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. The food  drinks  and service are all amazing. I've tried pretty much everything on the menu  and it's all delicious and unique. Atmosphere is awesome  too."", 'Very. Very. Fun. place to check out. such a little gem in Pittsburgh', 'We ended up going back here a few times while visiting Pittsburgh. My partner is vegan and loved it. It was pretty packed every time we went  which I think is a good sign.\n\nI thought the pierogi options were great and both times got an order to go to take back to the place we were staying. I thought the Cykoria I Sliwki had way too much pickled prune on the plate. The endive and beech & oyster mushrooms were good but I would have rather gotten a lot less pickled prune  a little more thyme oil and a piece of bread.\n\nSpeaking of bread  the slice that came with the Golabki was great and actually would have liked a little more to dip into the roast tomato sauce. I enjoyed the cabbage and buckwheat roll and everything tasted like it went together very well.', ""This place is delicious!!  I highly recommend this...and also if you are Polish then you will appreciate how they've crafted delicious meatless alternatives to your cuisine.  The meat is not missed...\n\nIf you get there before they open  there will be a small (may be larger on certain days) queue.  Upon opening  the line moves quickly.  They take your order at the bar as you walk in and you seat yourself.  It's a unique way of ordering  but it works well and is designed to get your noms quickly.  Don't panic  they don't rush you through your meal.  We had a lovely meal on the back patio.\n\nFor food  I had some smoked cabbage pierogi's that were heavenly.  A delicious placki (potato pancake) and some kluski slaskie (potato dumplings).  Topped off with an apple tart (that I had to take away to eat later because I was so full).  So good!\n\nIf you've had pierogis  these won't disappoint.  If you've never had Polish food  this just feels less heavy (less greasy) than a lot of other places.  I am not a vegan or even a vegetarian  but I highly recommend this place  restaurants that are plant-based  but just serve good food are something that should be commended.  Good food is  simply good food.  Go meatless...you won't miss it all."", 'I love settling in at a restaurant for a nice meal  but sometimes I want awesome food (and Apteka\'s dishes with brilliant flavors are certainly that) but I\'m short on time. Many people have kids  after-work commitments  a dog in the car  whatever  but still want delicious vegan food  in a city that doesn\'t have a ton of vegan options.\n\nAt most restaurants  there\'s a thing called ""take out"" - novel concept  I know - where you can call ahead and pick up your order. Apteka disallows this. You can place a takeout order  but only if you\'re physically present at Apteka. Which means you\'re waiting around the restaurant while they prepare your meal. Worse  they\'re absolute jerks about it.\n\nSure  some upscale restaurants don\'t do takeout orders. But Apteka isn\'t that. It\'s a bunch of hipsters (I say that lovingly because I probably am one) standing around in torn-up hoodies.\n\nI liked the food  for sure  but the snippy staff and unwelcoming policies have to go. This is exactly why non-vegans hate trying vegan places.', ""Yup. Loved it.  Went with my meat-loving bf (I'm a vegetarian) and he loved it as well.  We got the Kanapki (favorite) and the Cykoria (also good but not nearly as good as the Kanapki).  The Salatka (the only salad on the menu) was the only item we considered not worth it  because it was just a salad of mixed greens with what appeared to be a few pieces of pickled potatoes.  The menu said it had shallots and apple but the dish we got didn't have those (unless that was like infused into the dressing or something?) also the salad's dressing was so spicy that we couldn't really eat it  I'm huge on spice but that amount of spice just concentrated on mixed greens wasn't great.  We also got the pierogies which were amazing.  My boyfriend got a cocktail with tequila and citrus and he loved it  I tried it as well and thought it was awesome. \n\nOverall would highly recommend to meat eaters and vegs alike  with the particular standouts of the meal being the Kanapki and the pierogies.  The only disappointment was the Salatka which I would not recommend due to the spice as well as the disappointing lack of ingredients considering it is nearly the same price as other much more complicated and hearty items on the menu.  Will definitely return.  \n\nAmbiance is chill and casual cool.  Wait staff was very nice and attentive.  You order your food and then get a number and sit wherever you want and then the food comes to you that way  you don't have like a waiter to yourself.  This wasn't a problem and actually I liked it."", ""Apteka is one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. Their creative take on Polish cuisine incorporates flavors that are always new and delicious. They know what they're doing in every aspect of their business and I have a lot of respect for how they built this experience from the ground up. Cocktails are a must try also. Good for late night food  which is rare in Pittsburgh. It's a must try!"", ""One of my favorites in Pittsburgh!

So much variety  creative and most importantly tasty! We tried more than half the menu and just about everything did not disappoint. Highlights were the peirogis and the faux fried cheese made with bubble mushroom which i had to ask twice if it was cheese! Potato dumplings were great as were the cabbage and oyster mushrooms.

I've had just about everything on the menu -- my faves are the Horse & Pepper sandwich  sauerkraut + mushroom pierogi  and potato + yogurt small dish.

The Tartine toppings include carrot pate and radish pickle; leek  Apple and mint and celery  pickle  apple and dill.   All are culinary delights.  Other small plates include beet soup with celeriac toast; Kartofle (pictured) which features potatoes  apples  lingonberry jam (mmm) and yogurt; Belgian endive with pickled prune and beech and oyster mushrooms.   All are delicious.\n\nBig plates include pierogis (a Pittsburgh staple  but these are among the best I have sampled)  see pictures.  Four is enough for sampling.  Golabki is an interesting cabbage  buckwheat  roasted tomato and bay bolete dish.  I have not tried the sorrel salad but a friend described it as excellent.\n\nApteka also offers sandwiches   try the horse and pepper (pictured) which includes a vegetable pate  horseradish slaw  pepper relish  black garlic butter and chilies on a roll.  They have a variety of interesting cocktails and an interesting beer list.  For a non-alcoholic drink try the birch water.\n\nUnder no circumstances should you skip the deserts.  If you are like me  and try the apple tart with dried fruit compote  you may never try the others  though the spiced gingerbread with poached pear and prune preserves may eventually catch a wandering eye.\n\nThe restaurant has caught quite a following in a few weeks since opening and for good reason.  Give it a try  you won't be disappointed!"", ""Apteka had me eating vegetables I don't usually love and loving them. My family came here together and I was able to sample a few different things from the menu. I got one of the sandwich's and my dad got the other. The sandwich's were my favorite part of what we ate but everything was of note. I am a vegetarian but this is the kind of place omnivores can really enjoy."", ""The food here was absolutely amazing and it was all vegan! I didn't know how to pronounce anything on the menu  but the menu does a good job of explaining what is in every dish. The portions were good and the price wasn't too bad. Drinks are expensive and small  but they pack a punch  so it's definitely worth it. If you have a nut allergy  watch out bc a lot of the dishes have nuts. I let the staff know and they were very accommodating."", ""Not a vegan but appreciate being vegan lite from time to time. In any event  my friends wife really wanted to try this and he asked if I wanted to meet up here. We had a table of 4 and noticed that upon arriving you order right away. We each ordered an item and a beverage and sat down towards to the back where they are building some outdoor seating! My drink was the (Vodka  black currant  vermouth  burnt lemon) which turned out to be very good. I had some food before I met up so I decided to try their Salatka z koperkiem which is a salad in case you were wondering (salad with sorrel  red mustard greens  shallot  apple  radish escabeche  and lots of dill). My friend got the Pierogi and he said it was amazing! Other drinks of the night included trying a glass of their Birch water which none of us had ever tried. It had a sweet taste but different than coconut water. Almost nutty flavored. It was also semi sweet. We all agreed that it was strangely good. My friend and I at that point decided to infuse it with vodka and other flavors at some point down the road. All in all  we had a good first experience and will be back again at some point. \n\nTl;Dr: Vegan cafe that boasts good  creative food with inspiring cocktails. They should have the runners pick up orders from existing customers so you don't have to go back and wait in line if you want another plate or cocktail."", ""Great food and great cocktails. Even if you're not vegan  you'll love the food they serve here. Give it a try. They put tons of care into their food and drinks."", 'Great food.  Nice drinks.  Sweet staff.  Great  minimal decor.  Awesome music.   Love it.', 'Neither my husband nor I are vegans  but I enjoy Eastern European food  so I wanted to try this restaurant. Around 6 PM on a Friday  we found a free parking spot on the street  and we entered the busy restaurant and asked for a table. They encourage you to order at the front rather than the table and to pay before the food arrives. I give the kanapki sandwiches 3 stars because I enjoyed the taste of two of the three of them. I give the barszcz 4 stars because of the strong beet-tasting broth  but I prefer some solids in my borscht. I give the pierogi 3 stars because I could not determine which flavor was which until I cut into them  and I liked the sauerkraut and mushroom flavor more than I liked the potato  parsnip  and turnip greens flavor. I give the golabki 3 stars because of the buckwheat filling. The total bill was ~$40 total including tip. The cashier/waitress was nice. No drink refills for the flower-flavored soda or the water were offered  but we were OK. We will not return to this restaurant  but I encourage you to try this restaurant if you are a vegan and enjoy Eastern European food.', ""This place is insanely good. If I lived here I would come all the time. Don't miss the poppyseed cake with apricot and 'yogurt' dessert."", 'The food here is incredible! Met a vegetarian friend here for dinner and drinks  and I was not disappointed. I had Pierogies and Borscht  both were fantastic and I would not have known they were vegan if nobody told me. It was difficult to get a table  but once we found one it was a great night.', ""I have to say I was not excited when I first heard about a vegan Polish restaurant  but the food and atmosphere at Apteka blew me out of the water. \n\nFirst impressions were great: cozy  modern ambience bathed in warm light and a great sunny area in the back. Courteous cashier and attentive wait staff.\n\nWe were happily basking in the ambience when the food came: \n* a mushroom  dill and chive soup with mushroom dumplings\n* 2 kinds of grilled crisp pierogis: one stuffed with potato/kale  and the other with mushrooms\n* potato dumplings in a thick spicy carrot sauce \n* 3 tartines: mushroom  beet  and pickled cabbage\n* sandwich with some kind of crispy nut patty  beets  caramelized onion spread\n* apple crisp\n\nThe food was incredibly flavorful and unique. The mushroom soup and dumplings was the standout dish: it was like the definition of umami. We finished every last drop of that awesome soup and chewy dumplings.\n\nAny kind of dumplings here are spectacular: the crisp pierogis (both kinds) were bursting with flavor and tender textures  and the potato dumplings were super hyyge (wrong region of Europe  I know - i just can't think of another way to put it). \n\nAnd that apple crisp?! how the heck did they get it so flaky and crispy and buttery-tasting without adding any butter?\n\nApteka  can I teleport your restaurant to San Francisco?"", ""A local friend took us here for my introduction to Pittsburgh.  The food totally rocked.  We had non-veggie east european food another day  but Apteka was better.  The cocktail with the poppy seeds is pretty awesome too.  Yes  the line to place an order can be long  but they're giving loving attention to each customer when you get to the front so it's all worth it."", 'Highly creative vegan food\n\nLoved the roasted carrot tart is and oyster mushrooms\n\nSoups were amazing\n\nVery well prepared eclectic food and drink \n\nDining room is simple and unimpressive \n\nSandwiches superb .', ""One of the most original vegan restaurants in the country  Apteka is about as Eastern European as a plant-based restaurant can get. Its menu features potatoes in just about every form a potato can enter your meal  from pierogis to soup  from pancakes to  yes  even the salad had boiled potatoes in it. But it was all worthwhile  well-cooked  and worth the wait--and that's the only bummer here  there can indeed be quite a wait. No reservations for parties under six. You order from the counter  and then  when you get your food  you just have to hope there's space to sit. So go early  or late. It's crowded because it's so good."", ""I love basically everything about this place.\n\nLet's start with the food.  It is seriously  seriously delicious.  I know this has been said before  but even though Apteka is all vegan  you will NOT miss meat -- or even dairy.  I am a pretty big meat-lover and I thought every bite of the food was not only delicious but surprisingly packed with umami. I might even be so bold as to say that this is the best vegan restaurant I have ever been to in my life.\n\nAs the original flagship dish  the pierogis are not to be missed. The owners used to run the well-known pop-up pierogi nights!  The sauerkraut and mushroom one  in particular  is to die for  and the yogurt-mustard sauce is so tasty you won't want to waste a single drop.\n\nI also love the kanapki (toppings change seasonally  I think) and the endive/mushroom dish. As I mentioned  none of these dishes are lacking in umami in the slightest  despite being vegan.\n\nThe cocktails are inventive and VERY fairly priced at $6-8  aka nearly half the prices you'd find at a craft cocktail bar. I love their incorporation of pickled flavors in both their cocktails and food alike. The bourbon  pickled prune  and sage cocktail is a good choice if you love a sour drink.\n\nTo top it all off  the atmosphere is tops -- hip yet casual -- and the service is friendly. You order at the counter  get a number  find first-come/first-serve seating  and they bring you your food. Personally  my favorite spot is at the bar where you can watch the cocktail mixing magic happen!"", ""Vibe was a little Uber hip for us  but the incredible  savory  delicious food was worth it. We got the daily toasts  pierogies  and special sandwich. The special sandwich was the most bomb of all  smoky and incredibly filling with mushrooms and cabbage galore. Everything was delicious. The cocktails were well-balanced and beautifully presented. Highly recommend for dinner. (But don't get the laurel tea-it tasted like hot water.)"", ""This place is bizarre. What's with the huge curtain upon entry that serves no purpose and is just in the way of the line of people ordering. The service? Totally unengaging  unfriendly  and unhelpful. The system they have going on is completely unorganized and inefficient. I found the food very bland. And the atmosphere was what it is  an old car garage with new white paint. I will not be returning."", ""I used to come here once a week when I lived in Pittsburgh. I am not vegan and I got tricked into coming here  and when I saw the menu had no meat  I was saddened. But don't be tricked! It tastes better than any restaurant foods in Pittsburgh and it's really cheap/affordable! Their pierogies are the bomb. Everything is amazing here. It won't disappoint. I crave it every day. I wish this restaurant was a chain restaurant"", 'Once again I\'m venturing off into the world of vegan dining! Apteka definitely met all of my expectations and then some with their Eastern European flare and food that was filled with flavor!  My friend and I decided to order two small plates and then an order of pierogis to share.  As a first timer I wanted to try everything on the menu  which admittedly took some time to decipher.  The pierogies were outrageously delicious...and Pittsburghers beware...these are NOT Mrs. T\'s...consider your pierogi game upgraded when you leave Apteka!  Filled with sauerkraut and mushroom  or the celeriac  apple  potato  and horseradish  and plated with some mustard greens and black radishes  I found myself consciously eating slowly just so I could savor each bite and not finish too quickly!   The serving of seven was the perfect amount to share between the two of us.  We both got the same small plate  which was a combination of beer braised cabbage with just enough char to really get that ""grilled"" flavor  and oyster mushrooms in a decadent butternut miso...I almost asked for bread to be sure and soak up every drop!  \n\nThe food here definitely deserves 5 stars.  My only regret is that because you order at the counter  and it\'s clearly a popular spot  if you don\'t get everything you want right off the bat  you could be spending some time in line if you try to go back.  We considered dessert but ended up passing just because we didn\'t want to wait.  The menu is unique and I can\'t wait to return and try other things...oh and arrive early because by 6:30 it was packed and there are no reservations for parties smaller than 6.  This place is definitely worth the hype!', 'Best vegan spot in Pittsburgh. Worth the wait. Must try the pierogies. Great drink selection.', ""The food is incredible.  The service model is not.  We took out of town guests here on a busy night and it was a nightmare.  All of these people standing around looking for a table.  There was no room to stand either  we were basically on top of and bumping people who were already seated and eating.  At busy times  you are in a competition with other patrons for a table.  People hover around tables that they think will leave soon.  There were people who's food came out of the kitchen before they secured a table.  It was such a nightmare for the people eating and the people waiting.  On busy nights  I also think they must fry up the perogies in advance because they come soggy and slightly cold instead of hot and crisp.  \n\nI adore the food and decor but would only come again during off peak hours."", ""Every single thing is perfect. The menu is much more exciting than a lot of veg places I've gone to before. I had 4 cocktails there and every single one was perfectly balanced. The food is creative and cooked well. You can really taste each ingredient  and can find layers of surprises throughout your meal. Everything was fun to eat. The staff is very casual  funny  and they act like real people instead of trying to dramatically smile and be over the top. I want to come back here and order every single thing they have to offer... and I will."", 'We went on a Friday night and it was booming with people  music  and a warm inviting atmosphere. \n\nWe started with a small plate of Kanapki and moved onto a big plate of Pierogis andKluski Slaskie with an apple tart for dessert!  \n\nYou order at the front and find yourself a seat which was difficult with a big group on a Friday night  but the service was excellent and the food was a great experience.

A casual and hip eatery that is definitely a great addition to the Bloomfield neighborhood.\n\nI came here with a friend who was visiting and was excited to try vegan central/eastern European food. We split the kanapki - which were each very good but I have to say the standout one was definitely the carrot pate. \n\nFor our meals  I had the pierogies. These were really good although I wish the different flavors were more distinct. Either way  each of them came out hot and flavorful. My friend had the Horse and Pepper which she raved about!\n\nThe drinks were good here too and all priced below $10!\n\nIf I had to pick a must-try  it would have to be the carrot pate kanapki.

That said  all of the other dishes were phenomenal as well..\n\nThe food is surprisingly cheap given the quality of ingredients and preparation.

I love this place!  Reasonable prices  unique and flavorful food  tasty cocktails  and modern design.  I hope they get an outdoor patio in time for summer!

Kind of wish I could order it a la carte.  \n\nThe pierogies are amazing (so glad they serve them in two different size portions)  and the cabbage rolls were great with a killer  memorable tomato sauce.  The entree salad (can't remember the name) was unique because of the bitter  spicy greens.  \n\nI'm really looking forward to trying the sandwiches soon.  \n\nA wine option or two wouldn't go amiss.\n\nSuch a wonderful addition to this end of town  and like no other restaurant in Pittsburgh."", 'The concept at Apteka is modern  fun  and sleek - vegan food at its best.

I wish I could have taken pictures of our other dishes because everything looked so unique and tasty.\n\nService was quick and no frills--they basically just bring your food and let you eat. You order at a counter bar style. One thing to note is that when it's crowded the line tends to go out the door.

The carrot pate is out of this world and the homemade bread is killer! The pierogi are perfection. I've also sampled the potatoes and the salatka.

But then I remember these people have worked for years to perfect their craft. And it shows. \nThe drinks were fantastic so of course that was a great start. Everyone who worked there was friendly. We had the specialty sandwiches and the veg pâté was delicious. We made a mess but it tasted great just the same."", ""Apetka is a great little space with charming decor. However  when I say small it truly is. To the point that a line goes out the door for folks waiting to get in. I understand the European concept of ordering at the bar and having the food brought to the table. But again  there's just not room. Ok with that small little negative comes the big  big positive. I am over the moon with this menu. Love that they offer small and big plates as well as fantastic cocktails. And the black pepper soda  you guys  OMG. I need that bottled for home: it's so good. Went with friends and had tartine and pierogis. I'm a meat eater but can throw down on some good vegan. The food is absolutely divine. The vodka black currant and rum plum wine juniper cocktails are so refreshing and appealing. Just a quick walk from home  I'll definitely be a regular. This is one of those spots we'd walk by anxiously awaiting their opening. Wow it was worth the wait!"", 'On a cross country road trip and ended up here for the pierogis! Delicious. Good drinks and cool vibes too', 'Back in 2004 when I was a wanna be high school hipster type thing   I got in on the fashionable becoming a vegetarian trend. It ended up sticking until today. I\'ve watched the trend ebb and flow  go to spots like quiet storm close. Then the era of wanna be food network chefs with luxury meats coming into Pittsburgh and bacon memes infiltrating my social media feed coincided with a slowdown in the vegan/vegetarian food culture.\n\nThat obnoxious intro is only to note that it\'s really cool to have a new hip trendy restaurant where I don\'t have to have an awkward 5 minute conversation with the waiter about how they can ""make any dish vegetarian."" And it\'s pierogis. The food was incredible and reasonable. Not to mention it also had a great cocktail menu that was manageable in price.\n\nSo  if I can have a moderately cosmopolitan experience and eat vegan food without being at a place that doubles on selling eat more kale shirts and yoga mats on the side. Win win.', ""Verdict: Neat vegan establishment with a solid menu and refreshing drinks.\n\n+/-:\n+ Casual  simple  hip atmosphere\n+ Delicious food at more than reasonable prices\n\n- The service was horribly slow  table service was non-existent; our food was brought out as it was ready which ended up in us receiving one dish at a time with anywhere from ten to forty five minutes between courses. I'm down with order-at-the-counter  but then the table service should be clean and deliberate.\n- The staff weren't very welcoming or helpful; I wasn't sure how much or what to order and was met with some sarcasm and felt shamed after asking for some advice on our decision; after sitting down  we were told that a DJ would be coming soon and he would set up where we were sitting...we weren't asked to relocate  just asked to not be sitting there when he showed up?\n\nWith such a small place and in such high demand  it didn't really make sense to me why they had a DJ taking up table space to play some low-key weirdo music. The music was cool  though. I'll definitely be back to try again and see what kinds of tastes the rest of the menu works out."", ""The salad... I rave about the salad and I give them 5 stars for just the salad.\nMy friend and I shared a total of four dishes. The only ones I recall is perogies and salad  I also remember killing my low carb diet by eating the sliced bread. \nThe drinks are very tasty but a little in the upper end in cost. \nI didn't know what to expect  to be honest. But I was attracted by the small and vegan menu. \nI tried so hard getting the recipe for the salad dressing from the friendly staff. No luck  but I have ideas. \nWill definitely go back next time I get a loan for the drinks."", 'UPDATE: Avoid the ""Kartofle z jogurtem migdalowym;"" it is not good. Get the perogies and ask for just the potato. They are excellent. The smoky flavor comes through in the perfect amount.', ""Really unexpected is the best way to describe Apteka in my opinion. I arrived thinking it would be an upscale vegan spot with menus  sit down table service  a swanky bar and some description of the menu items before ordering....and nope Apteka is not really any of that! I felt as though I was dining in either a foreign country or Hawthorne in Portland maybe (it is that level of hip).\n\nThe menu is written on a large scroll in charcoal pencil with little to no info/context on what the heck you are ordering when you walk in. I am not picky so I didn't really mind this  but it definitely put the pressure on to make a game time decision with the massive line behind me. We ordered the special sandwich of the day which had caramelized apples and onions I think and was on a baguette  and the Baba Jaga (basically a ton of pickled things with grainy mustard  their veggie pate  and on homemade bread). For a beverage I got the tequila and wildflower. \n\nYou grab a table number and snag a seat if there is one open! Luckily we got the last open table in front of the bar. I enjoyed the atmosphere of Apteka for the most part  although I felt it was a little too brightly lit for dinner time if I am being wildly picky. Otherwise I really liked the all white interior  with minimalistic decor and dried flowers and branches throughout. \n\nOur food and cocktails arrived  the drinks were strong and delicious and damnnn for $6 per cocktail? Insane bargain for the quality. The sandwiches were delicious and so  so filling. I could only eat about 1/2 my Baba Jaga. The homemade bread to me was the standout of my meal though I made the fatal flaw of not ordering the pierogies. Anyway back to the bread-- it was super dense  packed with all types of seeds and  crumbly yet sturdy  some of the best bread I have had in a while and coming from Philly  ya know that is some good bread!\n\nWe got the rest of our sandwiches to go  our bellies packed with enough fermented foods/probiotics to last us for about a week. I will absolutely be back and I will not miss the pierogies next time."", ""Meatatarians  have no fear. Do your vegan and vegetarian friends a service and come here for dinner one night. Don't be intimidated  don't think you won't get a good meal  and come with an open mind.

Want to add another cocktail or a dessert? No need to get back in line  just order from one of the bartenders or waitstaff. \n\nDon't know what your ordering? Ask lots of questions. The staff was wonderful and didn't act surprised or upset if you needed help with the menu.\n\nMy wife and I split three different plates including a large plate of pierogis (how can you not order pierogi here?!) and enjoyed every bite  and how affordable it was. The cocktails are more daunting but man  they were delicious. I had one that was scotch based with apple and seasoning which was delicious  while we wife had a plum liqueur based cocktail which was sour and refreshing.\n\nIt's no doubt they opened in the exact right neighborhood and everyone raved about the food on their way out as we overheard plenty of guests since we sat at the bar. Give em a try!"", ""By far my favorite restaurant in pittsburgh. Have lived here for 26 years and eaten all over.

Good service and food comes out quickly."", ""I came here for drinks before and had a decent experience  but came here for a birthday dinner last night and finally got to try the food.\n\nService: It was average. I walked in and looked around  not knowing if I was supposed to seat myself or how ordering worked and had to ask one of the 4 people behind the bar if I should sit anywhere or wait to be seated. Would have appreciated being acknowledged and told how their process worked. No one walked over to my table in the first 10 minutes after I sat down... not even to offer water. Not great. \n\nFood: Overall a 4/5. The pierogies and beet sandwich were incredible. I don't think I liked beets until trying the sandwich! The Salatka with sunflower shoots was... fine. The gin and prosecco cocktail was delicious. Super refreshing and I could have had 3 more! The apple crumble with sour cherry compote was UH-mazing. The only other thing I wasn't a fan of is that... dill. comes. on. everything. They are quite the fans of dill. You would hardly realize this menu is vegan...great options here.\n\nApteka fits in with the revamping third Renaissance that Pittsburgh is going through where hipsters abound and service is hands-off.

I had never had this sort of texture of potato before  I was amazed.

The spread on the bread tasted very medicinal  not my thing.\n\nOverall  good experience. I would return."", ""I had heard such great things about this place. Maybe my expectations got in the way of my tastebuds but I was quite underwhelmed. The music was too loud and weirdly trancy and there was a desperate need for air conditioning. The food was pretty bland and undercooked. I'll give it another go based on its reputation but I cannot recommend Apteka based on my experience."", ""Awesome! I grew up with Polish food on Christmas  and have a soft spot for it in my heart  but I've always thought of it as objectively pretty bland and boring. Apteka proves that wrong!

We shared the potato pancakes with pate and and roasted red peppers. Never had that type of topping but it was amazing.  We also had the pierogis platter with horseradish and pickled beets.  Yummy.  My wife had the mushroom soup with dill and she loved it.  We finished with a couple mind-numbing desserts - a rich white cake with warm pears and candied pepper corns and an apple-pear tart.  Wow.

I hope this place is around a long  long time!!!!', ""Food is quite good  particularly for what it is. What I do not quite understand  however  is their service. They've a large and I imagine knowledgeable staff  but their counter-side ordering approach of all courses and drinks at once seems to take advantage of neither. The result is mostly a long queue and then food / drink being delivered without much explanation or a reference point (and all at once). \n\nI'd like to go back and see it all again  and see how often the menu changes. It was good but I'd very much like to see a change in their service approach. \n\nJust my preference  though  for non-byob establishments."", ""The food here is amazing!  I am a meat-eater  and this restaurant teaches you how satisfying a plant diet can be.  The reason that I can't give this restaurant a 5-star rating  however  is because of its service  or lack thereof.  This is a gourmet restaurant with a service model based on McDonald's.  Thus  you must wait in line to order all of your food and beverages before you even sit down.  If you later want another drink  you must get up and go to the bar to get another.  You are forced to learn the menu on your feet and order quickly lest you anger the folks behind you.  My wife and I were really put off by this and almost walked out before getting to the one and only cashier to order.  (At least McDonald's has multiple cashiers.) Given that they do have servers  this all seemed so unnecessary and merely contemptuous of the customers."", ""Amazing food... fun environment. Always worth the wait. After you order your food it doesn't take very long for it to come out to you so waiting for a table has never been a problem for me."", ""My partner and I went to Apteka on a Saturday night. It was about 8:00pm and there was a line out the door  which moved relatively quickly. The menu is posted on the wall as you enter and you order everything (drinks and food) at the counter when you walk in. You can choose to leave your check open or close it right then. From there  you take a number and find an open table. Being 8:00pm on a Saturday  it was pretty packed and we came pretty close to having our food arrive before a table opened up  but it worked out after all. \n\nFor drinks:\n- vodka \n- whiskey/fernet \n- gin/celery\n- whiskey/prune\n\nVerdict -- All of the drinks were REALLY good except the whiskey/prune drink. It tasted like a flat jack and coke and the prune juice was more like syrup at the bottom. No bueno.\n\nFor food  we shared:\n- kanapki\n- pierogi\n- horse & pepper sandwich\n\nVerdict -- Kanapki were very good and each were unique. Both of the pierogi were really good. The horse & pepper sandwich was good  but probably wouldn't order it again. I'd rather try the other good looking dishes they had!\n\nOverall  I would highly recommend giving this place a shot. I think the creative dishes would leave even the most devout carnivores satisfied. My one real gripe is how the restaurant is set up. I get that they want to have a relaxed vibe by having you order and pay for everything at the front  but if you want to order more drinks or to close your tab  you have to get back in line (which can be long depending on when you go) to do so. I would think having the servers handle additional drink orders and the check at your table would have been a better set up  but maybe I'm wrong."", 'After being away from Pittsburgh for a few years  this restaurant was a pleasant new development.

They have everything from small dishes to main courses and desserts. The amount of flavor packed in these vegan dishes was incredible.

I wish I would have got a pic of the drinks but I was too excited about mine being mixed that I forgot."", ""You wouldn't think vegan and Polish go together  but they do.

I ordered the 3 tartines (which were celeriac  carrot  and beet) and the pierogis. She ordered the Salatka and the Kluskie Slaskie. It was a good mix of dishes  she had raved about the burnt sunflower seed in the salad which was a really unique flavor. The tartines were simple but tasty  I really enjoyed the beet variation. While pierogies aren't my favorite food I enjoy the mushroom option topped with the creamy sauce- the side of cucumbers and beets really made the dish refreshing and lighter. The Kluskie was unlike anything I've ever had before and the toasted grains really added a nice flavor and crunch. I would highly recommend this interesting dining sensation in Bloomfield  especially to my vegan and vegetarian friends."", ""Vegan Polish food  you say?  I was skeptical at first also  but the food was both interesting and flavorful and the drinks were amazing!  We wanted to try everything... but fell short.

The little wonderful vegan heaven that is tucked away in Bloomfield. Apteka is Central & Eastern European themed. Anyone who knows me  knows that I am obsessed with most European food so this is a great spot for me when I just happen to pass through Bloomfield.  It honestly surprises me just how great this place is (I am a carnivore for life). But honestly  I could eat here all the time and not even think twice about it. \n\nLets start with the fact that I can't pronounce 99% of the menu (but I always have a waiter that is patient with me and we usually end up having a few laughs over why crazy pronunciations). And while we are on the topic of waiters  my service has always been excellent. My food always comes out in an ample amount of time and they always seem glad to help if i have any questions. \n\nWe usually tend to get the big plates to share. My favorite is the Pierogi ( one has mushroom and sauerkraut  the other has apple  potato and horseradish).  Oh My Gosh. These have a flavor that you have never experienced before. And definitely not like any other piergoi you would find around here!\n\nWe also never leave without grabbing dessert. We almost always go for the Apple tart with a dried fruit compote.

I definitely do not share the views of others for this establishment.  We arrived there and the first thing they say is the the kitchen folks are taking a break so we could not order for another 20 mins.  Okay  so we went to sit down and wait till it is time.  We proceeded to order:\n\nBababurger and fries.  Presentation-wise  looked good.  The bread was extremely dense and was hard to bite through.  We had a hard time cutting it in half with a knife for sharing.  The patty had next to no flavor and the texture was odd when eaten with the hard bread.  \n\nPerogies plate (spicy) - this was better than the bababurger but all you could taste is spice and overwhelms the different stuffings for each one.\n\nThe only highlight of the night were the fries as they tasted freshly cut and fried.  However  halfway through we got tired of it; maybe due to our palates being numbed from the food aforementioned.  \n\nAfterwards  we felt really bloated throughout the night going into the next day.  It was quite an uncomfortable feeling and for that reason  there will not be a return visit here.', ""The hype is real people. Went here for dinner last night with my  husband and 9 month old. The vibe is casual and cool. The decor is simple and I appreciated the selection of tunes. The staff was friendly and helpful. They have a full bar and a selection of local beers (shout out to roundabout brewery).\n\nThe menu is small  which I like. We had the tartines  the salad  and the large order of pierogis. The salad and pierogis were delicious! The pierogis were simultaneously doughy and crispy and the filling was a yum twist on the traditional potato and cheese. The tartines were good but I will probably try something else next time and there will be definitely be a next time.\n\nJust a side note- my husband and I cAme here early .. Like 5pm. Not sure how kid friendly it would be much later. They didn't have high chairs."", ""I love this place. I wouldn't normally assume vegan polish food to be this amazing. The flavors blow me away.

It was surprisingly incredible."", ""I heard such great things about this place that when I had an invitation to dinner I suggested this location.  I really was dying to try their Perogies.  They are served as two different types of Perogies  two different fillings in one platter; unfortunately the one that had the dark filling was not to my liking  the other was delicious and since I'm a vegan there was practically nothing else on the menu that I could order other than the mushroom soup  which was delicious.\n\nI would say this is a really great place to go if you're Polish. It's seems to really focus on that cuisine; you can tell by the menu and I'm amazed at how crowded it was so I guess having the location close to Polish Hill was instrumental to their success."", 'even though Polish cuisine will always include a lot of meat this Polish inspired began food is surprisingly tasty! especially home made bread and delicious kanapki.', 'I am not even vegan  but if I could eat here everyday I am happy to convert to veganism. Everything we ordered was flavorful. I love the unique combinations of flavors and quality ingredients. My favorite dish is Boczniaki z kapusta (oyster mushroom  cabbages  and butternut miso).

And I\'m really happy I did.\nI\'ve been going to Apteka consistently over the last year  and one of the plates I keep ordering time and time again is the Baba Jaga. Simply put  it\'s a sandwich with beets  pickles and some other veggie goodness. I personally have always hated beets - I never liked their intense red color and flavor. But for some reason  the beets didn\'t taste like beets to me at all. I can say the same thing about many of their other dishes - they prepare the vegetables in such a way that their flavor and textures are truly transformed into something that you probably have never tasted before. Suddenly  you\'re forgetting that you\'re getting your healthy dose of veggies (and all for a very reasonable price)! Other dishes I recommend are their potato pancakes  pierogis  and panapkis. As for drinks  I love the Becherovka (I get it every time)  but their Scotch Fernet cocktail is also really good.', ""You can't go wrong here. I've been here twice and found the food to be solid. It's Pittsburgh  so there are pierogi. The mushroom is my favorite of the two options (other is cabbage and potato). There is use of dill  so keep that in mind. It comes with a bit of cucumber and beets.\n\nMy go to is the boczniaki z kapusta because I love mushrooms. I've had it before  but on this occasion the rye was burnt on one side. Bummer. The oyster mushrooms were good and quite filling. Hubs got the special sandwich and ate every last bite.\n\nThe line to order is the bottleneck. There is one person taking orders because it's an order and sit spot. Not a problem  but the menu on the wall is difficult to read since it's vertical and you might not be able to read the bottom. Menus are also on the counter  not so helpful to those in the back of the line.\n\nOverall  cute place  with fun vibe. There is a full bar  so that's a bonus.

The balance of flavors and textures is artistically crafted and you will not find this anywhere else. We will definitely be going again!', ""Let me just say this up front  because everyone needs to know  this place is delicious and packs some mean flavors into every dish. Oh... and it's vegan. But that should be an after-thought  because you will NOT miss meat here. You won't even THINK of meat here. You'll just think about how every bite is ridiculously good. \n\nEverything about this place is just stellar. The ambiance is warm and inviting  but also casual. You actually order at the front counter and then find yourself a seat. It's pretty tiny  but has a beautiful outdoor area that's covered. I'm wondering what they'll do with the space in the winter  because it's great to have that extra space. There's beautiful floral arrangements on every table  shelf and counter. They really create a comfortable environment. \n\nWe ordered the Kartofle z jogurtem migdalowym. Don't worry  you'll probably have no clue how to pronounce anything on the menu other than Pierogi. The dish is potato  apples  lingonberry and yogurt. It's different  but delicious. The potato's were crisply cooked and the combo of the berry and yogurt was great. We also got the Kanapki  which is freshly baked bread (I believe baked in house) with different spreads on top. I wish I could remember what they were  but they rotate daily. Finally we had the pierogies  which are seriously a must get here. One was sauerkraut and mushroom and the other one is smoked potato  parsnip  and turnip greens with smothered yogurt and mustard on top. Both were incredible  but I liked the smoked ones the best. \n\nOn the weekends  I don't doubt it's packed. So my advice would be to go early.

The food was okay  I ordered the combo #9  once the first layer of meat was gone  I was in for a surprise  the amount of oil soaked the rest of my dish. The kimchi was good  so that\'s all I really wanted to eat. However  the friendly staff??? I know as an Asian  good service is the least of my problems when eating out but these ladies that run the restaurant... one seems like the owner and was extremely rude to our whole table from the start. We went around closing time(1 hour before close)  so we just brushed it off because of that fact and attitude they were giving us. The first problem was when they came to take our order- I said  we\'re just waiting on one more before we order. Then   the quick ok and eye roll *attitude* the second problem- cold watery tea  we asked for a new batch and they replied back with ""it\'s closing time  we aren\'t going to make anymore"" okay  I agree it would be a waste to make a whole batch but there\'s so many other options they can work towards to accommodate. Now  the third problem the side dishes. I know places that will replenish the side dishes for the table  especially when we order a lot. We ordered 4 ""combos"" that means we\'re entitled to 4 rounds. However  when we asked for our third one  she ignored us clearly heard us but she decided to do closing duties first as her priority and 5 minutes later- we got our request  she switched the regular sizes to the smaller side dish that holds the beans for our side dishes (look at the picture menu) At this point  we know they just want us to get out. However for a table of 4  2 1/2 replenishes didn\'t suffice  so we asked for more from a young server (very nice  reason for 1 star) and the owner lady comes and says ""no you\'re not allowed  you had enough were going to charge you!"" it\'s a restaurant  we\'re not beggars we\'re customers expecting service. I felt so bad for the young server  he just stood there awkwardly as she is yelling at us and him for accommodating our table.  After she walked away  he went back to the kitchen and gave us the side dishes. Surprise  he gets scolded. I\'m really reliant on yelp for great restaurants  this one is the only one that was terrible. Maybe because of the cheap prices  and basic 10 items  hard to mess up on orders- however there is many other options out there that are willing to accommodate and service you.', ""First time here  had the kimchi soondubu and it was good. The service was okay  the servers weren't very attentive. They were doing each other's hair and so I went to fill our own water  but then eventually the one server brought us a jug of water for our table. Overall  was pleased with the food."", 'What can i say  this place is probably one of my go-to place. \nThey have a very small menu but each item on the menu is made to perfection.

Makes me miss Korea.', ""As always like their other locations this place is quick and delicious. The servers are always nice and bring out side dishes and tea quickly.

I've got a soft spot for soon tofu so this was perfect - and a convenient find as the small plaza the shop is located in features a Chinese bakery and a tofu shop too! We got in right amidst the Sunday lunch rush  but fortunately got a table for two. The setup is your basic Korean restaurant - simple décor  self serve utensils  just soon tofu and a few other dishes on the short menu.\n\nWe ordered the combination soon tofu and the bibimbap. It took a while for food to arrive  which really deducted points given we were hungry and expected the food to come sooner than 30 minutes in given their short menu list. Perhaps we caught them between batches  or the bibimbap took longer than usual? Or they were out of rice for a moment? Side dishes come with the main which sucked - would've been nice to get our side dishes while we wait. The order in which they presented things was not ideal for the situation  but I understand that it's in their routine.\n\nThe tofu was super silky and soft which was a pleasant surprise. The soup was good and the mussel and beef in my combo soup was great. The shrimp looked overcooked  but served its purpose of flavouring the soup. The purple rice was moist but not overly so - which I thoroughly enjoyed. The side dishes featured yellow beans  bean sprouts  pickled radish  kimchi...generic and not disappointing. The stone bowl was alright - generic and nothing to write home about. \n\nOverall the location and tofu texture were great winners  but the wait time was not. I'll have to come back when I'm in the area to lay a verdict on whether it was a one-time mishap  and they're worth more merit for their food."", ""Best place for soon tofu in Mississauga!

It has ample seating and parking available at the plaza.

It was a first for me to eat a kimchi tofu dish  too. I ordered the been  pork  kimchi soup  number #3.

Came out to an even $9. \n\nI didn\'t even know where to eat the dish (i.e.  eat inside the rice bowl or the kimchi soup bowl). I told the server about my silly lack of experience  and she chuckled but helped me at the same time. She actually cracked the egg for me and stirred it into the soup. It was still bubbling hot when the egg got added to the mix. Yummy! The sound is so much better than ""snap  crackle pop"" from you-know- what cereal. \n\nI never cared about the presentation of the meal  when there\'s no need for it. It was kimchi pot  and that\'s what it looked like. I always thought that these dishes were spicy  well  from the kdrama  that\'s what I thought. I read that some dishes can be greasy  but mine was not so. I will review again when the opportunity comes. \n\nThe decor is just right. Wooden chairs  utensils in wooden boxes  and I have no complaints. I didn\'t use the washroom  so I cannot comment on that.

I have been coming here for a long time now but forget to write them a review.  I think this location is pretty small compared to the other ones.  Regardless the food is still amazing.  For the price  its ridiculously good.  I salivate thinking about this place.   As a typical Korean restaurant  they start with around 3-4 appetizers.  They serve their soon tofu with a side of rice in a stone pot.  They put water in the pot for later at the end of your meal to soften to Rice.   My wife loves that part.  The mix of crispy and congee like leftovers.   For some dishes but not all  they include a raw egg for u to crack into the soon tofu when it first comes out.  What attracts me the most is the price.  For this much food  and the food is great  the price is amazing.

I love that this restaurant comes with good selection of side dishes and servers are polite to refill and ask if you need more. Also like that the entree comes with the purple  mixed-grain rice. Delicious and healthy. For ~$7-8 for a hot pot of delicious broth  fillings  and rice  you really can't go wrong.\n\nTheir soon tofus - wow  there's something that keeps me addicted to eating it beyond what my stomach tells me.

Their soon tofu soups come with hot pot rices (the purple Multigrain kind)  although sometimes they use the stone put and then put it in a bowl for you instead of serving it.

Definitely one of the best in Mississauga. Their selection is limited  but the quality is very high due to that.

We had our rice scooped and ready in front of us but it took a good 10 mins for our 2 outstanding tofu soups to come out. By that time the bulgogi soup was not boiling hot anymore while our tofu soups were....I'd say it defeats the purpose of coming to this place since people come and expect a boiling hot pot.\n\nThe side dishes are good but I have had better around the area.\nI even tried this place in Markham and it was ok..nothing spectacular. There is better sundubu jjigae out there..."", ""Hearty and satisfying  especially in winter (but I came in the heat of the blazing summer for some reason).\n\nI don't like that fishy taste that comes from seafood  so I played it safe and went with the beef/pork tofu soup (around $10). It was good and really filling for the price. Because it was summer though  I was absolutely stuffed. The soup had great consistency  there was a good amount of meat and vegetables  and it paired perfectly with rice. My parents had the seafood soup  tasted mine (I didn't have the guts to taste theirs)  and said that there's was by far superior and more flavourful.\n\nThe side dishes were good  the meal overall was solid; great flavour  great tofu.

Piping hot  but not as spicy as I thought it would be. I ordered the extra spicy but got a below average spice that didn't make me sweat. When I'm in the mood for spicy  I want to be challenged and there was no challenge here. Maybe that's just a Korean thing. \n\nService was super friendly and responsive. Was offered numerous top ups on my side dishes. Was instructed to crack the raw egg in my soup. Was offered water  tea and just generally amazing customer service that you'd expect at a 5* restaurant. \n\nAll in all a great experience for a great price.

Of course I ordered the Dumpling Soon Tofu soup and when my food arrived  they gave me my soup with an egg and purple rice in the pot. The waitress scooped the rice out of the pot and into a bowl then proceeded to add water into the hot stone pot. I carefully cracked my egg into the soup and it thickened a bit and I dug in  and boy was I not disappointed. The soup was SO flavorful and it had the right amount of spiciness that made me pant for air to cool off my tongue. The dumpling fillings were outside of it's doughy shell but I was okay with it.

When they first opened up it was $7 a meal but they have since they increased the prices but it's still affordable and well worth the money!  I went with my daughters and they had the broil bulgogi and I had the kin chi tofu soon. Both dish very tasty. I love the purple rice in the stone pot. The starter Korean dishes were very tasty and your can ask for more when you finish. This is my favourite place. Very authentic and the wait staff are so nice. Amazing service.

They used to have it with another type of root veggie that was chewy and to die for. The soon tofu is always bubbling hot  so is the rice. A perfect meal when it's freezing outside. Your tummy will love you!! \n\nNot happy:  The bulgogi dish needs more veggies and could be a bit bigger. The orange decor can be modernized. Sometimes  the staff don't really speak English. \n\nVerdict:  I love Korean food and this one is one of my favourite!! The price is great too!!

Then one hair in my bi bim bap around the middle as you try to mix the ingredients. Lastly  one in my soon tofu. I know that a hair won't kill me but it's vile to experience and also shocking when they lack the courtesy to apologize. I told them after my first experience that the cooks need to wear a hair net which they didn't have one. After the second time  I warned them that if I find one again  I'm never coming back. I've been to certain restaurants downtown hundreds of times and never a hair... 3X is just pure ignorance and negligence."", ""As a Korean who grew up eating at this place when I was a teenager  I came back to try it again.

Unlike Yonge and Finch  the parking is free - bonus!\n\nUpon entry to the establishment  we are promptly greeted and offered various seating choices.  The one detraction is having messy tables while seating people nearby.  Nobody wants to sit next to someone's garbage.  The menu is the same  but I think the prices are a bit higher than North York - around a buck per dish.  Not earth shattering.\n\nI have to say  I like the food here better than North York.  I ordered the HaeMul (Seafood) SoonDubu.  The broth is so important.  It was richer and heartier than their central location.  Usually  half way through the meal  the stew starts to cool and the soup loses it's consistency and flavour.  Not here though.  Really enjoyed it.\n\nFinished up with the NooRoonBap (the burnt rice that is softened with water in the stone bowl.). Yum!  A good meal was had by all - even though I burnt the mouth again!

They got all of our dishes wrong and the waitress looked pissed . Not at the cook nor the waiter that took our order .. but at us ! She never apologized either .. to top that all off  in our seafood soup  there was only ONE muscle ..nothing else . We paid an extra 2$ for one piece of muscle . VERY disappointing ... Another thing to add  they never served us the rice in a HOT STONE POT .. Maybe cause it was in the evening that they didn't want to clean the stone pot ?

Not too salty  not too bland!\n- price is right! Around $7.08 for most meals; they only have about 10 items on their menu\n\nCons:\n- small menu (but I think this is a pro!)\n- environment: it's clean  but it's not a '1st/2nd/3rd date place'; more of a 'we're in a relationship  let's eat good food regardless of location' place\n- it's a bit hard to find as it's located in a strip mall in a 'dirtier' part of Mississauga\n\nOverall  good price  good food - definitely would come again!"", ""I was suprise that they didnt have gamjatang.

The menu is simple  the price is good  the stew is comfort food at it's best. The simple options leave little to think about. Group favorite include the kimchi stew  the bulgogi  and the squid and pork. The stews are cooked to a nice thick boiling consistency that tantalize the senses. The flavors explode with each bite. I enjoy this especially on cold nights and winter day. The only thing is service is a bit slow  and at times  the vibe aren't all that welcoming. The shop is quint but the plaza is stupid busy.

Turns out they had a location in Mississauga too  which makes it so much more accessible!\n\nWhen we first arrived  the restaurant was about 80% full  which was a pretty good sign at 8:15PM Thursday night.  The decor is nothing to write home about - the brighter ambiance highlighted sparse wall decor  with occasional posters and a large menu placard.  It was pretty clean  and the tables were close to each other but not too close to be uncomfortable.  I really liked the chopsticks and spoons (metal  long style) neatly packed in a decorative box on each table.  Tables were clean  stain-free and sticky-free  altogether providing a nice casual place to eat.\n\nThe menu is spartan.  There was a total of maybe 10 items  with the majority tofu-stew.  The prices are great - ranging from 7.08 to just over 10.  My buddy commented that the menu items are priced so the bills come out to be even numbers  which is a great convenience!  We each ordered a soup item  and shared a plate of beef for a grand total of 40 dollars after tax.\n\nI was told that the tofu-stew really is what the place specializes in  so I chose a dumpling soon. tofu.  I was also warned beforehand that the meat amount in the stew is minimal  so our party of 4 shared an order of beef.  The beef was sizzling hot when it came and it had a nice sweet marinate  making the beef tender and juicy.\n\nThe stews arrived bubbling hot and smelled absolutely delectable.  My glasses steamed in a matter of seconds and I had to turn away to let'm clear up so I could actually see my stew.  The bowl of stew / soup is rather small  and true to form did not contain much meat and about 2 regular sized dumplings.  I had also ordered it medium spicy  and I found it had kick but nothing to be alarmed over.  \n\nTo complete the dish  the meal came with a bowlful of the purple rice.  While the entire stew was delicious  the real highlight to me was the quality of the tofu.  The stew was really filled up with this tofu that I can only describe as silky smooth. They held their shape (instead of breaking apart when you try to pick it up)  but offered absolutely no resistance when biting into them. The texture was out of this world and was really some of the finest tofu I've had.  \n\nAltogether the price was right  and the food was tasty and delicious.  I was not entirely full from the meal  but I would say that the portions are sufficient for your average meal.  We did end up spending quite a lot of time there - a combination of slower service and taking time to enjoy the meal.  I did find that the wait-staff were slow to pay attention when we needed anything  and after the food came  they pretty much left us alone (I would have expected them to come back  ask how it was  ask if we wanted to refill our tea cups).

This is a good place to get your sushi fix  since there aren't many sushi options in town. While it isn't the best sushi I've had  it's pretty decent. Taste-wise  not bad  but presentation-wise  these sushi chefs are hella sloppy. Maybe it's to meet the demands of the lunch rush? \n\nNo. 1 Sushi is not going to be anything you haven't tried before (unless you've never had sushi).

So even though the name had changed a couple times  I was rather hesitant...\n\nI shouldn't have been. I got the #3 special  which was a (spicy) tuna roll and (spicy) salmon roll with choice of soup or salad (i got salad) and it was excellent!! Plus only cost 12.95...\n\nIt was a very good spice level without compromising flavor  the fish tasted fresh and was good quality  and the portion was great (plenty of food). Not to mention the extremely personable staff.\n\nI didn't try any of their more complex maki rolls  but saw some pass me after ordering and wondered if I should have... they looked great!\n\nI normally don't post reviews  just glean the wisdom of others  but I truly felt the need to compliment this place after my visit."", 'This place is straight up amazing.

More suited to take out but there are a few tables. The staff is friendly."", ""Highly recommend this place! \nThis is one of my favorite sushi places. Customer Service is excellent  everyone there is always friendly. \nAll the ingredients are very fresh  even the wasabi! \nI always just get take out because there is not much room for dining in. I'm usually in and out in 5 minutes. \nPrices are about average. \nTry their specials  they come with a side. I've always gotten the miso soup which is also excellent and fresh."", 'Excellent food at an excellent price. We each had the salmon/tuna/california roll combo (comes with soup).

Take-out or some high tables with stools to sit with one or two people. Great location off of Market Square.\n\nI highly recommend.', ""Had the salmon roll  tuna roll and avocado/crab roll. Decent serving size and price. The fish was fresh. How they cooked the rice though  could use a lot of improvement. It was stiff and dry. Japanese rice is supposed to be sticky  soft  and fluffy.\n\nNot the best I've tasted  not the worst either."", ""If this place had a frequent buyer punch card  I'd probably run them out of business. Their lunch specials cannot be beat! Everyday  they offer 3-4 different rolls and each come with miso soup or salad  ranging from $9-$12. The quality of the fish is excellent. It's fresh  flavorful and they never use tempura as a filler. The lunch rolls typically = 12 pieces of sushi. I know that doesn't sound like a lot but the size of their rolls  plus the soup or salad is always plenty of food. Sometimes  I am able to make two meals out of a lunch special! \n\nThe restaurant itself is very small. They have a few tables inside but I recommend ordering takeout if you're heading over between 11-2. Their lunch rush is busy so sitting at a table means you'll probably have a mass of people standing around waiting for their orders  leaving little room for personal space. \n\nAlong with their sushi  they offer seaweed salad  octopus salad & house salad with ginger dressing. I've never had a bad meal! \n\nThe staff is friendly  fast and professional. My only complaint is that they do not have an active website or social media account (other than yelp) to advertise their daily specials.

Tiny establishment off Market Square--you would miss it if you weren't looking for it. Sushi is fresh! Highly recommend!"", ""I'm not going to lie  I was apprehensive about trying out this place. I'm not sure why  either. But I finally gave it a try and I loved it! It's nice having an affordable place for sushi downtown  making this a great lunch spot. \n\nThey seem to have several specials that consist of one or two rolls along with soup or salad. I opted for the special with the California roll and spicy salmon roll with a house salad. The rolls and its contents were so incredibly fresh and the rice seemed to have a sweetness that made the rolls taste delicious. Although the rolls were sloppily rolled  it did not affect the taste at all. Ingredients in the salad were also fresh. This special cost me $10.95 and it came with 16 pieces and the salad was rather large. For lunch  I could not finish it. \n\nIn addition to delicious sushi  the service I received was quite outstanding. I ordered  paid and it was ready within a few minutes. \n\nWith the menu so reasonably priced  I will definitely be back!"", ""Excellent place to go! I happened to run into this place that's a little bit hidden but still in Market Square.

The place is small but you can always get your food to go and eat outside. I will definitely return!"", 'Sushi was well prepared.

You can really tell when they had you the takeout container  it is heavy!\n\nThe sushi was good but not the best ever  you can't expect that at this price but for what it was  it was good and I would go back if I worked Downtown."", ""Love this place  the quality of fish is very good for the price and you get quite a few pieces. Everything in nicely presented and if you are ordering takeout the chef carefully places everything in the Styrofoam container. There is hardly any seating but if the weather is warm you can just walk to Market Square and use one of the public dining tables.\n\nI've tried a couple of different rolls but usually come back to the spicy tuna and often get their specials (which change often  sometimes even in the middle of the day). I love the sauce they drizzle on the spicy tuna and the rice-to-fish ratio is perfect too. Lastly  the owners are very kind and seem to genuinely appreciate your business. \n\nBonus: they are open until 8 pm."", 'This was my favorite sushi place. I always ordered the tuna sashimi  and some days the chef would throw in a few extra pieces. Their miso soup is good.\n\nToday was the last time they will receive my business. The store smelled more ""fishy"" than usual but its a sushi place  so I thought nothing of it.\n\nI open my tray and am appalled at the fish. I tried one bite  and almost threw up.\n\n---Edit---\n\nThe owners have reached out to me privately  and have apologized for the poor food quality.\nI am going to give them a second chance this week.', ""Just missed the lunch crowd at 1pm. Limited seating but service was very fast. Sushi is really good. Good came out very fast as well. Ordered  sat at nice table by window & my food (3 rolls) came out within 8-10 minutes. I had a rainbow roll  spicy tuna & spicy salmon roll. All we're very good. I'll be back."", ""This is a small place located on a side street of Market Square. They sell nothing but sushi  miso soup  a few small salads (anyone up for an octopus salad?) and drinks. Think sushi with a fast food approach.  \n\nThe dining area seats 11 people and the seats aren't very comfortable. I think the idea is to get you in and on your way as quickly as possible which would be fine on a nice day when you can relax and enjoy your lunch outside in Market Square.\n\nToday I got the special:  California roll and salmon roll with the miso soup. The soup was tasty and I enjoyed both rolls; it was definitely worth the $11.72 that I spent on it. Actually it was more food than I really wanted and I ended up wasting about half a roll.  I really would have been satisfied with just one roll.  Chalk it up as a sushi rookie mistake... I never think that this stuff will fill me up and I'm always surprised when it does. \n\nMy only real knock on No1. Sushi Sushi is that the chopsticks that I got were warped -- I tried two different sets. It's not so much a big deal for me  I'm relatively proficient when it comes to chop sticks but I could see a newbie could get frustrated quickly."", 'Almost walked by it but decided to stop in.  Was very impressed.  The miso was perfect and the rolls were fresh and very good.  I would definitely be here once a week if I lived in the area.', ""Look  the idea of eating raw fish when your city is sandwiched between two rivers with unbelievably disgusting pasts isn't always pleasant... but if you know where to go  a purging of the mind is possible with some excellent quality.  Aside from Andy's sushi stand at Wholey's  I frequent No. 1 more often than any other.  They always recognize me and remember my name  either from frequency of my patronage or because I have a significant beard that is burned into their memory.  Either way  it's appreciated and they are always pleasant.  It's close to the office  it's relatively quick  and the variety is great... even if they pander to the yinzers by way of dressed up California rolls with Pittsburgh names for a few items  one of which contains cream cheese.  Filth like that should be named after the Monongahela  but I digress.  \n\nThis review is not for the specials  nor any particular roll  but more so the general satisfaction they provide with their sushi.  Crispy salmon skin rolls are simple but well executed  the green monster is a great vegetarian option with nice texture contrast (albeit pieces are giant and make it somewhat difficult to maintain a pristine facial shrub)  the spicy eel and avocado has a great balance of flavors  and the overall variety of fish gives you an endless bounty of options to help you dip your toes in the deep end.  In addition  the seaweed salad is always eaten on the side.  Forget the iceberg mix and ginger dressing... you can eat salad like that at home.  Expand your horizons and get more nutrients.  The seaweed is bright  crunchy  salty  and a little nutty from the toasted sesame seeds.  Oh  that neon green hair of a deep sea angel  be still my heart.\n\nAs long as they're slingin' fresh fish in my work neighborhood  I'll be going back at least every other week.  There aren't many places I'd feel safe eating sushi in this city  but I'm glad one of them is right down the street."", 'I stopped by on Thurs. prior to seeing a musical at the Benedum for a quick and inexpensive dinner.  Upon initially passing by  I wasn\'t sure if they were open  since the ""Open"" sign was unlit and nobody was inside.  Having ensured that they\'re open until 8pm  I decided to take a chance  and walked in.\n\nI was quickly greeted by a gentleman seated behind the counter.  Upon saying I hadn\'t been there before and asking him for a recommendation  he asked me what kind of fish I liked.  I told him I enjoyed salmon and tuna  and he pointed out the daily specials  one of which was a spicy salmon roll and California roll  and another of which was a spicy salmon roll and California roll  both of which came with a side of miso soup or a salad.  I decided to go with the first combo ($10.99 before tax)  with the soup.\n\nThe soup  was served first  was on the salty side and wasn\'t super flavorful  but it was served nice and warm  and made for a nice starter on a cold and rainy evening.  The rolls were brought out about 10 min. after ordering  and I was pleasantly surprised that 10 of each type came with an order.  Of the two types of rolls  I\'m definitely more a fan of the spicy salmon than the California.  The spicy sauces drizzled on the salmon rolls added a dose of zest  and the salmon itself added some nice color and flavor.  I found the California rolls rather bland--but then again  I\'m not a big fan of California rolls in general due to their blandness.  I know many people like them  but I\'m just not a fan  so it would have been nice if one of the specials came with something other than California rolls.  As it were  I was quite pleased with the amount of food I received for the price--for me  it was more than enough for dinner  let alone lunch.\n\nAs others have noted  this place does more of a take out business than eat in  but there is a counter as well as a few tables if you wish to eat in.  The man and woman who waited on me  who I\'m guessing were the owners  were very friendly  asking me how everything was and even bidding me goodbye when I went to leave.

Problem solved.  Traffic was lighter than normal and I was able to make the south turn into the DQ   parked  and went inside.\n\nThe store is a bit old and somewhat rundown  but it was clean and there weren't many people there.  I looked at the Blizzard board for quite awhile and decided to go with the Blizzard of the Month--Confetti cake.  That's white cake pieces and confetti frosting blended with vanilla soft serve.  It was OK.  I should have stood firm with something peanut butter  but hey  when you're Blizzard of the Month  I guess you have to be good.\n\nI may stop here again but I'll order with more care.

How do you run out of cookie dough?!? In light of the smell and not having what I wanted  I decided not to get anything. In any case  I think I'll drive a little further to go to the South Durango or West Sahara locations and avoid this location at all cost.""]"

The Food is always the shining star at Westwood bar and grill. We went for a birthday party and had about 15-20 guests with us. It was not busy with one other table of 4 at the time. We immediately had problems with the server (which later on we found out was new) and her lack of experience. It took almost 15-20 minutes just for the drink order to be taken and served. The waitress then took everyones order  appetizers and entrees together  which I hate to do because 80% of all places seem to screw it up. Once our first round of drinks were finished we asked for another round and another 15-20 minutes went by with no success. We had to actually go to the bar to get them quicker  and there was no one at the bar  so not sure why the bartender couldn't have come over to assist? I got an appetizer and it never came. A few guests had salads that never came. The food came out in an awkwardly un rhythmic flow where half of the guests were eating and almost finished while the others were still waiting for their meals. When the food did arrive it was good as expected. I had a burger and was cooked to how I asked. Other guests all said their food was good when it had finally arrived. Long story short  if you want good food  i suggest it. The service was incredibly bad but the manager did come over to offer assistance and try to make things right which was a plus. The atmosphere was average  with a small doorway separating the dining room from bar area. If you want to go and try somewhere new  make sure to bring an extra hour of your time just to be safe."", ""My food was soggy and cold by the time it got to me. Also  kind of bland as well.

I am thinking they are only open seasonally with the Golf Course  SO I am very leary eating in establishments that are seasonal due to the fresh food factor.

The spicy chicken was so tender  and had a nice light batter on it.  The beef was even more tender  if that's even possible.  We loved the green beans too  and enjoyed the sauce which was a nice combination of spice and sweet garlic.  We got there before 6pm and the tables filled up pretty quickly after we got there.

This is as good as anything you can can on the east coast or Chicago so we are really lucky to have a place like this here in AZ.

The General Tso's rivals its competition from the west coast and east coast.  The noodles are fantastic  with fresh ingredients and vegetables  and the eggplant and salt-n-pepper shrimp are outstanding.\n\nThe only reason i didn't give The Nee House 5 stars (and I admit  I'm being picky) is because they do not have a dish I've been looking for in the entire Phoenix metro-area  but admittedly the Nee House does not  focus on Sichuan-style dishes (the dish i'm looking for is Sichuan Spicy Cold Chicken Noodles  which i fell in love with while living in the Bay area  but which is impossible to find in the Phoenix-metro area).\n\nIf you want authentic  delicious  Chinese food  make sure you give the Nee House a try."", ""A recent lunch at Nee House changed my whole opinion of this restaurant.  The crab and dried scallop fried rice was as good as the best fried rice I've eaten while living in Hong Kong. The rice kernels were perfectly al dente  not greasy  well-seasoned with the right restraint and the breath of the wok shined through deliciously.  Fried rice and noodles shows the real skill of a chef - it requires good control of heat and timing. \n\nWe also had the lobster with house special sauce. The lobster was plucked live from the tanks and weighed 2.75 lbs ($15/lb) so totaled approx. $40. The sauce was addictively spicy with sliced jalapenos and ample ground black pepper with the crunch of green onion tops - a little less sugar in the sauce would have made it perfect.\n\nYoung pea leaves are one of my favorite vegetables and usually available only at restaurants that see a lot of traffic from Chinese customers who appreciate them. They require some plucking to remove the less tender tendrils so tend to cost more. At Nee House  it cost $13.50 per plate. This is on the high side but I cannot resist the flavor and texture of the small tender dark green leaves so have to order it wherever it's served.  I asked for it to be cooked with garlic. It was cooked to the perfect level (nothing is worse than overcooked vegetables)  albeit a bit oily.\n\nThe fried rice is more than enough reason to go back to Nee House."", 'This is one of regulars!

It has been here for a few years and we order here regularly.  The ownership has been the same since they took over the location from Yummy China (which was a pretty bad place) and the food has been consistently good.  As others here mentioned  order from the chinese menu  not the western menu.  We've tried pretty much  the entire menu and haven't found too much that we don't like.  The cook sometimes comes out and chats with you - he will make you something specific or special if you ask for it.  They do seafood (lobster  crab  shrimps) really well; their house chow mein (dry style) is HK authentic; their beef chow fun and chicken and salt fish fried rice are some of our favorite dishes.\nPrice-wise  it's reasonable for the quality.  The place is fairly clean for a chinese restaurant.  Service wise - well  it's a chinese restaurant - 'nuff said.

It seems like every day  a new restaurant is opening with a new twist on some new kind of cuisine.  And don\'t get me wrong- I love that and am an avid trier of new places.\nBut there are some days when I earn for the simple  straight forward Chinese food I remembered eating growing up on the East Coast where good eats were plenty in the Chinatowns of New York and Philadelphia.\nThere are some of those places in Chandler and Mesa but I live in North Phoenix and don\'t always want to make the drive.\nWell  I was pretty excited to discover Nee House- I love the food there- it\'s simple and it\'s always good.

To top things off all you get is sauce  chicken  bean sprouts and onions. Needless to say  we will not be going back. Unfortunately  we we're regulars at Silver Dragon but they closed down.

It's all about the food here and that is why Nee House gets 5 stars in my book.\n\nBear with me as I leave the actual ordering of food to the real pros in my family  but there is a handful of dishes that are musts.  The Westlake Soup is a great  clean way to start off the meal and makes you feel good about yourself before indulging in the greasy amazingness that follows. As far as meat goes  the HK Style/Peking/Sweet & Sour Pork Ribs are deliciously sauced and have the right amount of meaty bite to go with it.  The Peking Duck is a go-to  as well. Tender pieces of duck with crispy skin served with hoison sauce  green onions  shrimp chips and slightly-sweet  soft buns (ohhh yeah) to wrap it all up in.  I'm a big fan of their Crispy  House-Fried Noodles served with a plethora of meats  seafood and bok choy. They make a pretty good steamed fish (it's served whole  with a head- so don't freak out) if you're being health conscious. It's served in a brothy  soy-saucey  gingery  scallionish sauce and is clean and simple.\n\nAnd lastly  if you are to eat ONE thing here  maybe even one last thing for your entire lifetime  let it be the Kowloon Style Crab..unless you're allergic to shellfish or something. It's a whole crab  served fried and covered in a ton of crispy garlic and jalapenos. The crab shell has a little layer of deep-fried goodness and I can eat the garlic straight up alone or on top of plain rice.  Yep  it's that good  and yep  I'm that disgusting.\n\nIf you're a fan of the basic sweet and sour chicken...fried rice...egg rolls...etc. etc.  I'm sure that stuff is good here  but I dare you to venture out of the boring and try some more authentic dishes.  The best way to dine here is to come with a big group and get a lot of different things to try  authentically Family Style!

The flavor was good though.  People continued to pour in for dinner.  This is an authentic Chinese dining with full fish tanks.  Prices are mid range.', 'Not worth it. Rice was overcooked. Beef for Mongolian dish was warm in the center of plate and room temperature around outsides which means it was most likely microwaved. Also the Mongolian beef dish had little seasoning and was not spicy except for the burnt pepper left in.  The shrimp with hot garlic sauce was not hot taste or temperature wise. Shrimp was rubbery and only lukewarm. Vegetables were overcooked on one plate and undercooked on another. Overall inconsistent and lazy cooking for the price per dish.  It is not worth it. Only decent thing served was Egg drop soup. Also avoid the fish they serve from the aquarium there are live ones swimming but there are also dead ones stewing in the same tank.', ""So  here's the thing...I believe that things on the dinner menu are probably more tasty than items on the lunch special.

The flavor was perfect and the broth was just thick enough. The lunch entrees were just mediocre  BUT the shrimp dish was amazing! We loved it. The jalapeños  onions and chives were a great touch.

When I got mine  there was a hair on one of the turnips in the stew (I'm definitely one of the lucky ones...don't be jealous Lana Del Rey!).  No big deal  i get that it happens...so I wait until my waitress checks on us and point out the hair.  The waitress then picks up the pot for a close inspection and acknowledges that it is truly human hair (good thing she did  since my vision at age 34 is deteriorating quickly).  She then holds the pot  looks at me  and asks what I would like her to do (she is young..i'm guessing in her early 20's  speaks English fluently  probably grew up in Phoenix and is part of the restaurant owner's family  at least to my understanding).  Since she is new to this culture of 'eating out at a restaurant'  I advise her that my preference is for the kitchen to re-make me the dish.  The waitress gives me a stunned look (since I am asking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow) and tells me that the hair is only on one turnip.  She then puts the clay pot back on the table  and provides me her advice.  She (and Confucius) says that I should simply remove the turnip with the hair from the stew and continue eating the dish.  (Whoop  there is it!).  \n\nMy first reaction was that this was crazy  but then I realized... the human hair was actually being used as an ingredient in giving flavor to the stew/broth.  Although not meant to be eaten  it was one of the magical ingredients that made the food at Nee House special.  No wonder the waitress looked at me like I was a leprechaun (and not the lucky charms type  more like the scary 90's movie version...you know the one they did so many sequels of)!\n\nWell  it is May  but Happy St. Patty's Day  and go check out Nee House!  It is a dining experience you won't forget.  \n\nTip: Keep your fingers crossed you get the early 20's female waitress (I think she's the only one in that age group working as a waitress there).

They just received a nice order and now she's being cheap and has the gall to ask for $2 which I declined.  No tip for them. They don't value and appreciate loyal customers. We need more good Chinese restaurants in this part of town to give them competition and teach them not to take customers for granted. If this restaurant was in San Francisco the customers wouldn't take this poor attitude and take their business elsewhere.

I guess I am a second-class citizen that cannot sit at my preferred table if it is too close to the staff as they eat their food. Totally turned me off. Ridiculous. And for those who claim ""it\'s about the food  not the service""  that is ridiculous too.

I normally will gloss right over this type of selection on a typical Chinese menu  but my friend suggested that I try this  and he was spot on.  The cod is cut into these elongated cakes  and the white sauce has the slight peppery flavor of ginger along with a mildly sweet/salty velvety touch.  Throw in the sautéed baby bok choy  and you have a dish that excels.\n\nThe shrimp with lobster sauce is just as delicious  as this is a great alternative to the typical Sesame Chicken or Orange Beef that you might order yourself.  \n\nStep out of the box a bit with this restaurant.

Had the shredded pork with hot garlic sauce  after they couldn't deliver the walnut shrimp without sugar.  The mayonnaise sauce had sugar in it.  She said it wouldn't taste like much if I didn't have the mayonnaise sauce.  OK. Then shredded pork  it is.  \nThe lunch comes with soup (egg drop or hot and sour)  a spring roll  white rice (or egg fried rice).  Had the egg drop soup which was delicious.  Probably the best I have had in the valley.  Some places put so much corn starch that it is more like a pudding--not here.  The salt level was perfect as well.  None of the noodles usually served with soups here.  Maybe they think it is not authentic. The spring roll was light  flavorful and not greasy.  I didn't care for the egg fried rice as it was too plain.  \n\nThe shredded pork with hot garlic sauce was a good portion  tasted OK   but they didn't spice it up the way I asked.  Instead they put a small container of red oil that had hot pepper flakes in it so I could add that to my food to make it spicy.  Really   you want me to add this oily  greasy stuff to my food?  How is it that other restaurants can spice it up by adding hot peppers without a problem?  The menu indicates that it is a spicy dish but it was not.  I ate most of it but took the rest home because the portion was very decent for $8.50.  \n\nI couldn't get my eyes off the table next to us with an attractive  young asian couple eating what appeared to be fabulous dishes.  They were all eating and no talk.  I think that is an asian thing.  When they eat  they eat.  But it might be because it was so delicious.  They had a whole lobster with some scallions and bits of other things.  They also had the salt and pepper pork chops with jalapeños  scallions and salt.  OMG.   That is one of my favorite dishes.  But I thought it was much too big for lunch for me.  They took most of it home because the portions were so large.  I also noticed that the price of the salt and pepper pork chops was $3.00 less than the place I usually get them and the portion was twice as large.  You know where I'm getting them next time!!!!\nThe service was courteous but not quick because I only spotted two servers in the whole restaurant.  \nThis is a simple  unadorned restaurant except for the food posters on the wall.  Not the prettiest of places but we come here for the food  right?  I believe there are some knockout dishes here because we saw several asian couples eating here which makes me believe they have really authentic dishes here.  \nI will give them a try again.  I am sure you know what I'm going to order!"", 'We were seated immediately.  Service can be gruff yet efficient.  We decided on spicy eggplant  Mongolian chicken  black bean chicken and seafood chow fun.  The food came quickly and smelled great.  We ate family style and enjoyed all the dishes.  The chicken in both dishes was tender and tasty.  Both were slightly spicy but not so much that you were sweating.  Rice comes with the meal.  Portions are large and there were plenty of leftovers.  A very enjoyable meal.  Prices are somewhat high but the volume is large as well.  Plenty of parking.', ""Pardon my lack of details  but I've been here multiple times over the past couple of years  and I feel the need to write a review!\n\nEverytime I've been here  it's been in groups  and every dinner has been excellent. It's more of the traditional Chinese fare  and it works wonders how everyone orders their own dishes and splits. The food quality has been excellent. Personally  I go for their fried rice and their soups  but everything on the menu is pretty damn good  as far as I can tell.\n\nPrices were decent  and the staff were pretty attentive with refills and such. Then again  I always try to come on the off hours. If you make a reservation in advance  it works wonders!\n\nI think it's one of the most reasonable Chinese food locations in the area  and I've already recommended it to my friends."", ""Very good Chinese food  in various regional styles  in a space that probably hasn't seen a paintbrush in 10 years. The prices were quite good. The live seafood tanks convinced me that we hadn't made a mistake. We were a party of 4 and all had something different  which we shared. The soup was tasty  the orange beef was outstanding  the roast duck deelicious  and the clams in a garlic and ginger sauce was exceptional. We smartly ordered only 3 dishes  because the portions were large. The service was brusk but pleasant.  We'll definitely go back again."", ""My friend and I ordered the lunch special chicken lomain noodles. Later we both had upset stomachs and felt horrible.

Very obviously frozen previously. Gross. If you're ordering the pineapple chicken  be prepared to sift through lots of huge chunks of ginger.

I had cashew chicken with egg drop soup and sweet sour soup  plus a couple of egg rolls.  Hot and sour was ok  but the rest was great.  So great  the almost two year old snagged my egg rolls.  My husband had left overs for dinner b/c the lunch portion was giant. Restaurant seemed even more authentic as the waitress seemed to be just a little bit angry but accommodating. For $13 for everything including tax and tip this was a winner.', 'I never thought of Nee House as a steak house but I only go for lunch. Maybe the menu  is different for dinner.  At lunch I compare it to other chinese places and  to me it is superior food. I have never had anything I did not like. I have been going there a long time.  Prices are comparable.

Having said that the portions are super generous for the price point and familiar Chinese dishes are up to par.', ""The food here is quite decent and somewhat off the beaten platter  but there is something about the ambiance that is off-putting. I can't put my finger on it: Is it the staff who seem grudging  or the lighting which lacks brightness  or perhaps just vibes from the building or the brooding fishtanks that line the walls (Why do they seem so unhappy?) Whatever  I go and enjoy the food--although often having salt hangover later--but still feel uncomfortable. I will commend the salt and pepper pork chops and the hot and sour soup. The eggplant dishes are among my favorites."", 'This was our go-to for Chinese and while the service was always pretty bad  we ignored it because we liked the food. This evening  I went with my kids and one of the dishes we ordered was sweet and sour chicken. Over half of the plate was non-edible chicken- the crispy hard deep fried chunks of batter. When I brought this to the attention of our server  she brought over the owner. When I repeated my complaint to the owner  not only did she not apologize or offer to have in remade  she yelled at me and told me that I had already eaten half of it  so too bad and stormed off and kept shooting me dirty looks from across the restaurant. The couple at the next table overheard our conversation and were openly shocked. Moreover  when the server came over to clear the table  she apologized. The owner came over and yelled at her and she winced with fear. Totally not a good situation there. WILL NOT go back...', ""The food was outstanding. We ordered fried rice  chicken with blackbean sauce  eggplant  and bok choy. The only negative was a waitress who had the personality of a pickle. When we ask her for recommendations she replied I don't do recommendations. We tried for the rest of the night just to get her to smile. No luck. But the food is worth the lousy service"", ""Went for our first visit on Christmas Day evening. Place was packed! - about a one hour wait for a table and about 45 minutes to get served. Worth every minute!!  Best Chinese food in the greater Phoenix area.  Lots of Yelp reviews panned the service but ours was great even under very hectic conditions.  If you're looking for ambiance this is NOT the place to go.  But if you're looking for outstanding Chinese cooking I suggest you give this place a try.  You won't be disappointed."", ""This review is based on takeout only.  This is probably the first place in two years where I've had decent Chinese food in Arizona.  We had two dishes  mu shu pork and curry chicken.  Although I didn't want the curry chicken  I was afraid to order a chicken that would be breaded or fried.  I was pleasantly surprised by both.  Hopefully next time I can actually get some chicken that is Chinese instead of Thai.  The mu shu was great.  The flavor was good  not too greasy.

The staff there was super friendly once we sat down and  they happily assisted us when we needed them  but they aren't super attentive nor did they go out of their way  and they can be a tad bit slow at times but really - when you have chinese food this good  I don't care about the service - just make sure you keep making that delicious food of yours!\n\nSo I know the boyfriend will be upset with me for ratting out this secret gem  but he knew he started dating a Yelper so really he knew food secrets don't stay that way for long!"", 'The food is always good  I am only doing 3 stars because of the service.

I normally go for a sesame or house special chicken  neither of which were on the lunch menu (and it clearly says no substitutions)  so I settled for orange chicken.  Almost all of the lunch prices are $6.99  with a few options being $7.99.  For this price  you get a cup of soup (choice of egg drop or hot and sour  which I was glad for)  your entree  white or fried rice  and a spring roll.  \n\nThe hot and sour soup smelled incredible  but sadly didn't live up to its scent.  I added some salt  but it didn't really help it out.  This being said  it's much better than almost all other hot and sour soups I've had around here.  The orange chicken was white meat and somewhat dry.  The sauce was okay  not too much flavor there either.  The spring roll wasn't bad.  \n\nA gentleman came in after me and ordered fried rice with his meal.

The older woman that had been taking care of us then told him that they were 'out' of fried rice.  Total crap  am I right?  If he ordered it and it was fine then  why isn't it now?  It soon became clear when the dishwasher came out with his own plate full of fried rice to eat at the corner table with the other staff.  I almost couldn't believe it.  The gentleman didn't catch this however  so he didn't complain.  I felt bad for him.  They obviously don't care too much about it  since they didn't offer to cook him a side of it.

Being raised in a Cantonese household  I would claim myself to have quite a high standard for Chinese food as we eat pretty much every variety of Cantonese dieshes.\n\nFrom the outside you would never guess it\'s a Chinese restaurant as it doesn\'t have any Chinese characters on the sign. All too many times  most of the so-called ""Chinese"" restaurants in Phoenix are way too Americanized so I hesitated when I first saw this restaurant. However  I found out about this restaurant from the Phoenix Asian newspapers and decided to give it a shot.\n\nInside  it\'s definitely not the best looking restaurant around  but it is a decent setting. One thing you\'ll notice about this restaurant  which is very much like some of the good LA chinese restaurants is that they highlight their signature dishes on the wall via nice full colored images.\n\nThe service was pretty decent and seems like most of the staff there (cook/servers) spoke Cantonese  so at least it makes the restaurant feel more authentic. The service was very fast too  had a nice Hong Kong feel to it.\n\nThe menu has the trademark selection of classic Hong Kong Style menu items  easy to read menu with pictures and both English/Chinese writing. Tons of clay pot items  meats  fish  soup  stir fry items. I ordered the walnut shrimp w/ mayo  beef chow fun  Salted Fish with chicken fried rice. Those are usually my favorite dishes to order at any of the restaurants to test their culinary skills. For people who know a little about Cantonese cooking  the importance of the WOK determines if the food is good or not. Usually if the restaurant has a powerful enough stove with a good quality wok  you can tell the difference in the taste of the food.\n\nWhen I got the items  I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of it. The food was seasoned just right  not too salty. The Walnut Shrimp was pretty decent size  the sauce was not too thick and not too sweet  just right. You can taste the freshness of the shrimp as it had that nice texture to it.\n\nThe beef chow fun was a pretty good dish. Beef could\'ve been a bit more ""fluffy""  but still pretty moist compared other places in Phoenix. It was a pretty generous amount. The seasoning on the noodle and beef was a little light for my taste  but still pretty good as the noodles were not too soft and not too tough.\n\nThe salted fish rice was a very big plate. The salted fish was cut just small enough and the shreds of chicken was perfect compliment to the dish. This was among my favorite dish.\n\nBack to the WOK thing  you can tell this place had some really good WOK action cause all the food came out real hot  and the texture of the food had all of the fresh ""STIR FRY"" element to it that you can\'t get from a regular pan. \n\nI\'ve been back many times and definitely very satisfied. I\'d probably caution any folks reading this review is that it is still not at the level of Hong Kong or LA  etc  but for Phoenix  it outperforms its competition by a long shot.', ""Ordered two House Special Chow Mein meals.

Well  we didn't have much left in the way of leftovers  and since we were at my mom's  there wasn't much to chose from otherwise in the fridge (she is a minimalist when it comes to food).  My dad had been having a hankering for some fried rice for the past few weeks  which worked out since it seems the only restaurants that are open on Christmas are Chinese!\n\nNee House is near my folks  so we called up and placed an order to go.  We were told that it would be 45 minutes to an hour until it was ready...yikes!  My dad and my sister left to go pick it up after about 40 minutes.....and they were gone for a really  really long time!  I guess the place was a madhouse  and if you wanted a table you had to wait in a line for a table!  They sat at the bar and waited...and finally after sitting there about 45 minutes they finally got the food (note to self: never try to order Chinese food on Christmas again!).\n\nWhen they got home we were all hoping that the food would make up for the wait....and well  it did!

We also got mu shu pork (this was the best I have ever had) and some sesame chicken.  It was breaded  but it wasn't greasy at all  and the sauce was just sweet enough  but not overpowering.  We had ordered some crab puffs  and they were good  but they had forgotten to give us the dipping sauce  which would have made them that much better.\n\nOverall  except for the long wait  we found Nee house to be really good.

So the food was dynamite times ten.  The décor  those big A___ fish in the tank look healthy enough - fairly clean - in a strip mall - whatever - Domino\'s is nearly next door if you are in a carry out frenzy.  But at over 50 years young  and a trained Chef - I never expected to be treated like CRAP no not CARP - and well frankly I was. This was the FIRST time I have EVER stiffed (no tip) EVER!!!!!!  Felt bizarre - but in a way it was liberating - I have tipped 20% for the WORST service in the country  (it\'s just part of who I am working in hospitality since I was about 17 y.o)....I was treated very well early on - told my menu choice is enjoyed by many  told how to \'manage\' it as I\'d never ordered this beef tenderloin in a lettuce cup.  ALL was appreciated.  Tips on making a side sauce  how to use the lettuce  how to eat the best \'bite\' ~ and I LOVE using my hands to eat  create little bites - so I chose a wonderfully compatible entrée.  All was well.  The wine glasses were small and not filled generously but whatever.  \'House Chardonnay\' was drinkable - but down it fast - it\'s not a sipping wine to enjoy and savor.  Okay so I told my waitress that I\'d like to order carryout near the start of my experience here.  She agreed to leave the menu with me so I could do just that at the end of my meal.  When dinner was over (yes I all but licked my plate clean - not a grain of rice left)... I was ready at last ... decided I would order either some kind of vegetable chop suey - or a vegetable dish - as I had juicy scallops at home and thought an easy meal for Sunday would be seared scallops with Chinese Vegetables (I know on Cinco de Mayo right?).  My waitress wasn\'t around and I got this other woman - abrupt  curt and totally not like my original waitress who was basically civil/maybe slightly warm even.  I asked her  ""I would like to know if I could order a vegetable dish that is pretty much all stir fried bean sprouts - perhaps some bok choy or spinach tossed in - but primarily bean sprouts in a light sauce"" - I guess that was interpreted as ""idiot woman"".  She says no we have nothing like that.  So I went on - well how about vegetable chop suey - but \'heavy on the bean sprouts\'?    She was annoyed...Bok Choy is tough  sprouts are tender you really don\'t want that she pontificates & ends with \'you want meat or only vegetables\'  I said I WANT VEGETABLES - IN A CARRYOUT DISH with a LOT of FREAKING bean sprouts - call it what you want - and how you want - but can you or can you not do this?  She says NO - it\'s bad very bad - bean sprouts are way too watery to order like that.  I say  ""miss I don\'t really much mind eating the food that I choose to order - if I like bean sprouts - I like them & know them intimately - and I\'d like to order a vegetable dish with a LOT of them - as in MOSTLY bean sprouts - think spaghetti - and you can save all the expensive vegetables for another customer.  She says  ""Okay but I have to charge you 2 dollars more"". By that time I was ready to go back to the kitchen myself and wok my veggies for home use the next day - but as it was my first time here decided against it and just said - FINE - JUST FLIPPING FINE ~ CHARGE ALL YOU WANT.  I have a hard time believing cooking staff can crank out fresh food on a Saturday night - all night - and suddenly get \'stumped and stupid\' not able to wok bean sprouts - and for all the ""less"" effort charge me EXTRA.  I told her  ""I am a cook/chef  you have great food here and I\'m impressed.  However if I tell you I want something - and you have it - the reason I cannot order it should be because management won\'t allow it - not because YOU feel I will be disappointed in my choice.  Am I clear to you on that?  I want to cook tomorrow using my chosen carry out dish ~ Hmmm... quick review  *a vegetable dish that has a large percentage/portion of bean sprouts* - at your $2.00 more pricing for being so wild and rebellious I guess.  I was super ticked off - at this woman telling me what I should or should not order because somehow she telepathically knew what would work for me and what wouldn\'t - ?  So I sit and wait for \'whatever\' and am getting angrier and angrier... Say YES or Say NO - but please DO NOT TELL me what I ordered will taste like crap ~ stupid  stupid and again very stupid thing to do.  I so was having fun and wanting to finally find a home in delicious Chinese Cuisine - this was better than at our little mini China Town Cultural Center by the airport by far.  So finally the carryout food came ~ and I wrote a note on my bill  my phone number and STIFFED the waitstaff and felt GOOD about it - The second waitress was BAD & mean-acting & gruff - pukey.

If you're ready to be a little adventurous  you're in for a taste treat!  I love their steamed fish  which is slathered in a delicate  flavorful broth.

Especially since its one of the few restaurants that is actually located in Northeast Phoenix opposed to Chandler or the Westside.  \n\nI recommend the French style beef cubes  snow pea leaves  and walnut shrimp.  But really most dishes are delicious.  The decor is not super impressive  but clean.  And the service is a bit lackluster  but the food is what you go for and the food is good.\n\nHappy eating!"", ""We ate here once and the food was good  but expensive. We got takeout for a special occasion last weekend  and the food was tasteless. We were all disappointed in the entrees we ordered. The Shanghai Noodles  my friend's favorite  were very dry with no sauce  and definitely no spices added.The Kung Pow Chicken and Mandarin Beef literally had no taste and not even soy sauce or salt and pepper would bring them up to par. We all enjoy spicy food and we found only two chiles between the two dishes  that were definitely not hot the way we like or have had at other Chinese restaurants. The only dish that resembled what we expected were the Walnut Prawns. This place is more expensive than any other Chinese takeout we have used over the years  and not worth the extra money--so you don't always get what you pay for. Our bill at Nee House was $54 [and we even tipped $6 bucks] compared to a recent similar order from Bamboo China  which was $34 and excellent! Last time we will order from here."", ""Being from Brooklyn I have a PHD in Chiney Food. Roast duck and Pig hanging in the window. Hand stretched noodles. Albeit we are a far stretch from Hop Kee or Big Wong in Chinatown this place does not dissapoint. They have the usual suspects here  even enough to satisfy the PF Changs crowd. Why people spend there greeny's at changs just blows me away! \n If you love eggplant they do a great job with the garlic eggplant dish. The geoduk clam is exceptional. If you have to ask....google it. Im sure you could find this gastropod online. It is briny  Sweet  oceanic and more tender than you might expect. Positively great!! The pea leaf is not on the menu and it is fantastic. The cold jellyfish is a must. \n Crab is fantastic and fresh. Choose your own Lobster for the Lobster in Black bean sauce. This is as close to chinatown as I have found. They are even raosting duck and serving it with multi colored rice chips; Something I have not seen since leaving NYC. \n WARNING! This is a family run establishment and the family on the floor is slow and moody. However  the owner and chef is extremely nice and will create you a special dish; or just ask for him to make you anything he can dream up and he usually will."", ""Been to this place with my family plenty of times. I love their rangoons and shrimp tempura and sweet and sour shrimp. Only thing is need to better their service and pricing online. Tried ordering online once but they said it's not the right price. They wouldn't even honor it."", ""We decided to branch out from our usual Chinese take-out  Mr. Cook's. That was a mistake. We ordered the pork egg rolls  the crab rangoon  chicken pan fried noodles  salt & pepper squid and beef with oyster sauce. The good: my husband loved the squid. The bad: everything else. I ended up using the rice to eat my leftovers from somewhere else.\n\nThe first misstep was the egg rolls. They were the oddest egg rolls I have ever eaten. The pork tasted like some type of processed pork you'd get in a grocery store deli. The crab rangoon were overly fishy and soggy. The chicken and beef were velveted to the point that they both almost tasted mushy. The worst part is that this all added up to $56 and will be going in the trash."", 'Love the food - great selection and the price is right.  One of the best Chinese restaurants around!', ""My fiancé and I have been to this place three times now  it's sssoooo goooodddd!! The crab friend rice  fried pork chops  wonton soup  shrimp with lobster sauce and a couple noodle dishes are some of our favorites!!!"", ""Good food; however  the ambience is not that great. Next time we'll definitely order a take-out instead of dining in."", ""I have a love and hate relationship with this place.  The food is usually great and delicious  but the service is horrible.  The waiter's and hostess are borderline rude and talk negatively about their customers.  I know  cause I'm Chinese and can fully understand what they are saying.  The owner is usually waiting tables and has a horrible attitude.  What can I say though  their food is probably the best around the area.  I'm done dining in there cause I can't stand their rudeness.  I usually just get the food to go.\n\nYou ever see the episode in Seinfeld where Elaine goes into a nail parlor and suspects the ladies are talking about her?  It's exactly what its like at this place."", 'Love love love this place.  Moved here 6 mos ago from the SF Bay Area and was really disappointed in the lack of tasty food (don;t get me wrong - I love my new desert home)  but it takes a while to find new favorites.  I\'ve found one in Nee House.  The only thing I haven\'t liked here is due to a personal preference - not the food itself (I loathe green onions or rather - it\'s a mutual loathing!!!  cuz these things just don\'t want to die!!!).  The service is good and can accomodate large parties well if you call ahead.  I was surprised to read other posts about lack of friendliness and service as that has never been my experience - even before I was a regular.  Hey  we all have bad days - or aren\'t as ""chipper"" as others think we should be sometimes  right?  Anyway - I am SO glad to have found Nee House.  It\'s a keeper. Enjoy!', 'Wenr to the place for take out on Christmas Eve. Ordered ahead and showed up when they said the food would be ready  40 minutes. Had to wait another hour to get food. Really? Food wqs nothing special.', ""Perhaps the most authentic Chinese food in the area and I wouldn't have expected it looking from the outside of the restaurant.\n\nDefinitely try their shaking cube beef which is super tender and flavorful. We order it every time we go there...you'll thank me later! LOL.\n\nFor a splurge  have the chef make you the house special lobster which includes black pepper  butter and large pieces of scallion and leak. Very flavorful compared to the normal ginger/scallion sauce that most places make.\n\nWe were so impressed with the food that we took our out of town guests who live in San Francisco over there and they were also pleasantly surprised with the quality and taste of the food.\n\nPrices are reasonable. Service has always been pleasant.\n\nI notice they get a lot of take out orders.\n\nWe will be back!"", ""Rolled in here on a whim for my never ending search to find good Chinese food in Phoenix which seems to be lacking. New House is one of the best I've found yet. All the classic dishes plus the have a large variety of live sea food in tanks used for salt and pepper crab  and the like. They have multi-dish options that are similar to say China town in NY  SF  or Chicago. The food is good  I really liked the House special chow mein and honey walnut shrimp. Definitely worth calling in some take out."", ""RUDE RUDE RUDE. These people don't know what costumer service is. The manager was so unprofessional. I asked for a new drink because the first one was watered down  so they brought me another drink with just less ice. What a joke. So I asked for just water. (They forgot to even give to me) Then I asked for chowmein with no vegetables and they brought me chowmein with onions. At this point I was very upset due to the fact that she just dropped off our meals and didn't come back to check on us. When she came back it was because she finally heard us calling after her and I told her my order was wrong and I did not want a new one  I just wanted it off the bill. She didn't say anything and left but came back with a younger fat boy and had him tell me that there's no onions in my food WHEN THERE CLEARLY WAS. He also had the nerve to be more careful when ordering when I thought what I had order was pretty specific. I was so upset that instead of offering me a different plate or something they came to tell me that I was wrong not them. I told him to stoping being rude and that I'm not paying for the wrong meal. I will never go back and I will tell everyone who I know that has gone there about this terrible experience."", 'Service not the friendliest  but the food trumps all. Served hot and delicious with just the right seasoning. The ginger chicken was outstanding', 'The food was pretty good but the service was terrible. We ordered a lobster  Peking duck  crab soup  and Stir fried noodles with beef. Everything was flavorful except the noodle dish; my favorite is the well-marinated lobster. Service was off from the receptionist desk to the time we left.', ""I wasn't sure about this place based on other reviews  but went on a Sunday because they were open and the kiddo was craving Chinese.  \n\nWe had the lunch specials.  All the food was generally salty and not so great.  The service was curt... like the server had something better to do. \nMaybe next time we'll do Panda Express."", 'Outstanding menu!!! This is less Americanized so it is different that many of the other Chinese joints. Lobster is the stuff!!! Love this place!!!', 'Very moody yesterday. Full moon? Never pleasant so we go less and less. Take out still good though. Not a fan anymore. The daughter should have never left she was the bright light.', ""We gave this place 3 chances to hit a home run and they didn't even swing at the ball! Terrible service  bland food and the place was empty. We asked for a drink and the waitress acted annoyed! We will never go back.\nI guess we have to travel all the way to Mesa for decent Chinese food.  Too bad."", ""Roasted duck seemed more fried than roasted but not bad for a duck fix. We also ordered the bok choy with garlic and that was really good. I also recommend the crispy noodles with seafood and vegetables. The gravy was very tasty. It doesn't beat LA's duck but satisfied our craving after a hot AZ day."", ""Live ants crawled from the rice bowl delivered to our table.  They offered us nothing  not even an apology.  All they did was squish the ants against the table cloth and bring out a new rice bowl.  Won't be coming back to this restaurant ever."", 'New House is a perfect place for family dinner. We went there on Sunday and saw many families had their family dinner here.\n\nThree of us ordered 4 dishes. They are all super delicious and we could not stop eating. The shrimp chow fun has a well-cooked big flat rice noodle. The pea leafs are cooked to perfection  keeping the crunchiness of this kind of vegetable. Clams with black bean sauce are fresh  huge  and juicy. Fried tofu with dried scallop is mild and delicious.', 'My sister and I have gone here a few times  she likes it  I think the food is bland and BORING.  The service is NON-Existent and rude.  Tonight  Sunday before New Years we went and the place was like an ICE BOX.  I asked the waiter to please turn the AC off.  It was only 66 degrees on their thermometer and the a/c was still on.  It is December and it was raining. He did nothing.  I asked the waitress  she said ""nothing I can do"".. my sister then asked Jade who owns it  and RUDE doesn\'t even begin to tell you. She couldn\'t have cared less.  I WILL NEVER GO BACK.  Tasteless food  rude personnel and dining in a walk in Freezer is the worst experience all the way around.  AND I used the ladies room    FILTHY.  You could see where they had sloped some water on the floor in the center but the from 6 "" away from the wall to the wall  FILTH.  NO thanks  how they keep their license beats me  how they keep anyone coming back is even a bigger mystery  it sure isn\'t the service or the food  must be the only place to get Chinese in the neighborhood.  Plus they claim to be Cantonese  there hasn\'t been a real Cantonese restaurant in Phoenix since Toys Shangri La on 16th and Camelback closed years ago.  This place  Nee House  is a very bad excuse for a restaurant.  Stay away if you are smart.', 'Okay  other Yelpers are not overly impressed with this place  but I\'m ecstatic.  Major bonus because we\'ve actually got an ""authentic"" Chinese restaurant in North Phoenix.  The tanks are filled with fresh crustaceans soon to be cooked and devoured.  Caucasians are not a majority when you assess the customer base  and the decor can be called ""clean but dive-ish"".  I love it.  The table cloths used at dinner time seem unnecessary given the rest of the decor.  The portions are plentiful.  The food has lots of flavor.  The chicken with black bean sauce is fantastic and spicy.  The prawns with honey pecans was okay  but a bit too rich.  The prawns are covered with an unusually rich mayonnaise sauce  which although wasn\'t my favorite  I give them credit for serving something unique.  The chow fun noodles should not be missed.  This is my new favorite Chinese restaurant.  North Phoenix is blessed to have Nee House in the neighborhood.']"

First off  where else on 17th Ave can you sit on a patio and get a 20oz. pint of beer (rotating  but we've had Wild Rose Velvet Fog and Guinness)  or 6oz. pours of good red and white wine for $4?! Real fruit margaritas are $5  all of this from 3-7pm.\n\nThis isn't just a watering hole though. The sushi is very carefully prepared and presented  and at a nice price point for the quality. One fusion item we've had is the perogies and karaage chicken  an interesting twist on the ever popular chicken & waffles trend. The chicken bites were was moist  with a crispy exterior. The perogies were clearly house made  with a nice and tender lightly pan-fried dough envelope around the fluffy potato-cheese filling. The drizzled sauces were slightly spicy and sweet  and the crossover green onion accoutrement brought the two cultures together.\n\nThe tonkotsu was straight up Japanese  and while the broth was good  it wasn't the best we've had in town. The noodles were good (my wife thought they were slightly overcooked though)  but the sliced pork was disappointingly lean and overcooked compared to a lot of great char siu at other ramen shops around town. While the hard cooked smoked egg was interesting to look at  I'd have preferred a soft yolk preparation  or even a jellied onsen egg.\n\nMiraKuru: take advantage of happy hour and the patio  go for the sushi and the fusion  skip the tonkotsu unless you like hard eggs and lean pork."", ""Being my third time here I expected decent food and service but it definitely wasn't. To start  the menu has significantly shrunk down in choices front Entrees from Japan. Also  previously my fav roll was dynamite but the rice was very mushy. Service wasn't terrible but could've been much better as the server didn't seem to care much about us  \n\nDONT SIGN UP FOR THE SKIPTHELINE APP PROMO. it was advertised as if you sign up with their code you would get $10 off your bill. However it wasn't your current bill; it had to be food ordered through the app. \n\nOverall  bye bye Mirakuru. NOT coming back for sure."", 'First Time here- had a nice patio atmosphere.

Will be back to try other stuff', ""Have to say this place is pretty dynamic.  Italian/Sushi/Lounge/Restaurant/Bar/Patio  take your pick!  Regarding the food  I've tried much of the menu  and haven't been disappointed yet.  There is a lot of choice  and the service was always very reasonable.  I recommend the Five Alarm Roll (love Jalapeños and Sushi)  the Teriyaki Glazed Salmon with Kimchi Rice and Soy Bok Choy (Kimchi may not be Japanese  but damn it's good)  and the crab croquette  LOVE THIS PLACE.  \n\nCome to think of it  I haven't tried their desserts ..... but after following them on Instagram  I have another reason to go back and try something new!"", ""Interesting ideas. Execution leaves something to be desired.\nThe regular sushi and Italian dishes were good - the baked brie was especially excellent - but the fusion food was not well thought out at all. Udon Carbonara  while good flavours  was like eating glue texture wise - udon and cream sauce are not a good combination. The Fusion stew had so much clam juice in it that it was nearly inedible.\nAnd the service was really  really slow  especially considering we were the only table in the joint on a Tuesday night. Poor value for the money. Not terrible  but I definitely wouldn't chose to eat there again.\nAt least the renovations look really nice?"", ""I ended up at MiraKuru on a whim one night as I was walking by looking for a place to eat on 17th avenue. We took a little time to think over our food orders and ordered drinks in the meantime. The drinks were overly sweet & not particularly memorable. We then ordered a few appetizers in place of an entree as we wanted to sample a few things. Then  we waited. Our server didn't come over to ask if we wanted more drinks or to explain any kind of delay on our food. The restaurant had a larger party and a few other tables but nothing a professional restaurant of that size shouldn't be able to handle. The waitresses leaned up against the bar facing the bar when they weren't busy and made no effort to interact with us. Finely  after waiting more than 45 minutes for miso soup  some sort of chicken appetizer and tempura  we decided it wasn't worth a minute more waiting. I walked up to a different waitress as mine was still MIA and let her know we wanted our bill. She was able to magically conjur up our chicken from the kitchen with in seconds but we already had our coats on and were out the door. MiraKura = waitresses with very poor customer service skills  and glacially slow service. I can't tell you if the food is any good  but I can tell you I'm never going back."", ""came here with a group of friend  the service was bad to be honest  but the food makeup for it i guess. I would give a 4 star if it wasn't the service we got that night when we go to this place"", ""Came here as a group of 6. Got here just before the rush hour at about 7 pm. Our food (main entrees) didn't get here till 9 pm. Service is slow and downright atrocious. Server was overwhelmed. Food was underwhelming. Got the udon carbonara. It was just chewy gravy mess. \n\nThis isn't a fusion restaurant like Carino. Basically  they have a Japanese menu and an Italian menu. Very few actual fusion dishes. \n\nI think people come here because all other places are too busy. I anticipate this place will be out of business in a year."", 'MiraKuRu  which means Miracle  is exactly what the food turned out to be  A Japanese/Italian restaurant  what a mix  I have been waiting for this place to open  with the Master Chef  SEKIHATA  KATSUYUKI and his experience from different parts of the world  working in some of the finest restaurants. He brings new flavors  fresh ingredients  and an amazing presentation. So after I saw that they had a soft opening  I took my family for dinner on a Sunday night. We were greeted and seated in the booth facing the front of the restaurant and also 17th Ave. I ordered miso soup  and soy ginger marinated chicken for appetizers  then came the mains: MiraKuru Roll  with Prawns avocado mango  tuna  cucumber  salmon  himachi  scallop. It\'s definitely the ""Feature Roll"". I also had the Dynamite Roll w/ prawn tempura  wasabi mayo  and citrus teriyaki sauce. WoW! My kids tried the Teriyaki BBQ  and Chicken Nanban  both need serious explanations  but I won\'t because they need to be Tasted and Enjoyed! We ended the night with Italian  we had the Tiramisu which was lovely  home made with love! And to Top it all off  the value for portion was great  I will be back soon!', ""Great service. Tried the full moon steak this time and it was decent but I wouldn't order it again as it was sour. Dragon roll was still delicious. Seafood medley is worth a try but might have been better if it came with a rice or some kind of starch."", 'Went with a couple other people. We started with Edamame beans  which were good. Myself and my Hubby ordered Italian - spaghetti with meatballs and Caesar salad. The spaghetti itself was fine  however the meatballs were not seasoned well and a little over done. My salad had a bit too much dressing and was actually quite salty - mediocre at best. My friend ordered the California roll  and had good things to say  other than it didn\'t hold together very well (she had to shove the whole piece in her mouth). The waiter/service was okay - he was dressed in a sports shirt  and slightly abrasive - but he made a sangria for my friend which was not on the menu. \nI\'m also not a huge fan of it being a ""fusion"" restaurant  and a bar  and a club? They were advertising a DJ for the evening. However  maybe other people enjoy that. \n\nOverall  experience and food was meh - probably won\'t return.', 'Definitely will go back for the pizza alone!\n\nMira Kuru is not really an Italian-Japanese fusion restaurant; the menu mostly separates the Italian & Japanese dishes  with only a small number of fusion items. There are plenty of vegetarian dishes to go with the fish and meat. I decided to go with the Italian & let my dining partner do the Japanese side. We both ended up happy  although with some qualifications. \n\nI am on a minestrone kick recently  so that was my starter  and it was ok. Unfortunately  they perched the large piece of toast (sun dried tomato & herbs  I think) on the side of the large & deep soup plate  so it was pretty soggy from the soup slopping up the sides as it was carried up the stairs. Not an attractive dish  but an ample one  fairly fresh tasting. \n\nPizza is very good! Neither thin nor really thick  the bottom was crisp even once it had been sitting for a while. I went with the margherita  and will happily order again. Good sauce  tasty slice  and a good value at $12 for the small. I took the remainder home. \n\nMy partner had the rainbow roll and several pieces of nigiri. He found the fish very fresh & the roll (with real crab) very flavourful. The rice did not hold together  however. \n\nService was a bit spotty but not terrible. \n\nWebsite says the happy hour special is $5 wine  but we were told it was actually $4 pints (20 oz. proper pints  in fact). Yet my $9 glass of wine was billed at $4. Not sure if that was because I mentioned the soggy toast (although I said I was not complaining or asking for any compensation. You think they would tell me if they were comping me  right?) Anyway  yay for affordable booze!\n\nSadly  not accessible  as they have a lot of stairs.', ""Love this place. I've tried the several other japanese and Italian fusion restaurants in Calgary and found this one the best.  The server was knowledgeable about the menu and offered great recommendations. Calamari with the spicy aioli is delicious! Dynamite roll is a must order! Udon Carbonara was extremely creamy. A little too creamy for my preference. Seafood risotto was slightly under done. Fusion stew didn't actually end up being like clam chowder. The broth was very watery and not much like chowder. \n\nOverall good place to try! I'll be back!"", 'Let me start off with the punchline: I am DELIGHTED to have high quality sushi mere blocks away! The fish was tender and flavorful  and generously cut  for a very reasonable price. My only niggles here would be the rainbow roll  which was delicious and huge  had a tad too much goop on the inside  and coupled with the rice\'s annoying inability to stick well  made for messy eating. But  once shoveled into my mouth  delightful!\n\nBilled as ""Italian-Japanese Fusion"" its more a case of dueling sides of the menu (the trifold style menu they use reinforces this impression). All of the food I tasted was delicious though. My partner tried the Italian side  and let me sample a slice of her pizza. It is fantastic: crust perfectly done  flavourful  sauce with a sharp tomato taste (will be great to try with summer tomatoes in peak condition)  cheese nice if a bit too much.\n\nThe place itself seems to be trying to find an identity. I mentioned the conflicting menu  but the decor too is struggling to find itself. The textured white walls and dark wood trim and furnishings from its days as Galla are still around  but now featuring wall hangings reinforcing the Italian side as they boldly declare ""pasta! spaghetti! meatballs!"". Large flatscreens have hockey on around the place so the fine dining also suggests bar. The lovely wine cellar is on display but the wines on offer probably should be drank sooner rather than held for multiple years. And reasonably loud pop/dance tunes add the final touch of incongruity to the scene. Service seems still pretty new  one server was pretty excited by the smells of all of the food coming onto the floor. For some reason we wound up with two different condiment trays--also beware  the soy sauce dispensers have a bit of a dribbling problem.\n\nStill  the food is excellent  the chef well pedigreed  and I wish it good fortune for its future on 17th ave. I for one will be back for more (the ossobuco demands a try next I think).', 'Interesting addition to the Calgary food scene. Menu is varied and lots of selection. Ordered a few different appies; would recommend the crab croquettes and mussels. Overall food was above average and service is great. Would be back!', 'I came here with my boyfriend to try both: italian and japanese food. We ordered the italian pizza  which personally I loved it  and the dynamite roll  with prawn and wasabi mayo. The food was very good! The service excellent! I definitely come back!', 'Good food  cozy environmental  great service  reasonable. I will come back again and recommend to my friends', ""I love this place we have been here twice so far and neither time was a disappointment!! Pizza is a must every visit! Sausage and Mexican pizza were so good. The second time had the bento box which was a lot of food for a very decent price. A whole variety of different Japanese/Italian cuisine which are two of my most favourite foods  so who can go wrong really?! It is not 100% fusion though and I've seen other reviews about the place trying to find an identity however this place has definitely came a long way from what was here before and I can tell the owners must have spend a lot on the decor  overall it is a great environment  it's elegant. My favourite spot is the booth for sure I love that huge window! Food presentation is beautiful  service was great  I can't wait to come back!!""]"

We've tried all the other Italian restaurants around Yonge/Mount Pleasant & Eglinton so we wanted to try this one as well. Just the other day we remembered it and went for dinner. It was an excellent meal! We started with the Calamari/Shrimp/Fried  Artichoke and it was very delicious. In particular  the shrimp was wonderfully seasoned and lightly breaded and fried to perfection. I only wish there was more of it. I had the Penne Con Vodka for dinner and it was also very delicious. I love cream tomato sauce and this sauce surpassed my expectations. For dessert we had the home-made donuts which were decadent and delightful. There were three donuts: one filled with lemon sauce  one with berry sauce and one with chocolate. Overall an excellent meal!\n\nThe atmosphere and service were also lovely and the owner came by to make sure we were having a good time. A great little restaurant!

Nice light garlic/oil sauce with sun dried tomatoes and rapini was perfect dish for a summer evening. Sausages were tasty but I would have preferred a bit of zing.  Still the ingredients worked really well together and I enjoyed it immensely. \n\nGrilled calamari was good but I prefer a bit more grill marks on the calamari. It looked a tad underdone but the taste was great. \n\nAbout $40 pp for wine shared app and pasta mains. Reasonable price for good food. Would go back again for sure.', ""Great Food!!

For a treat out on the town it's worth it!"", ""As a resident of the neighbourhood  I am always excited when a new restaurant opens - although the competition is stiff on this stretch of Mount Pleasant  as there are several outstanding food options in the area.\n\nWith that in mind  Tavolino certainly lives up to its' neighbours. The food here is simply excellent. The owner  Vince  recommended the special 'Pork Cheek Caesar Salad' and allowed us to order it  even though it was part of a prix fixe menu that we did not partake in. The reco was spot on  as it was the best Caesar salad I have ever enjoyed.\n\nAlthough the salad was a tough act to follow  the mains certainly held up. My wife and I enjoyed the gorgonzolla gnocchi and orecchiette bolognese. Both were outstanding. The flavours were brilliant and the sauces not too heavy. Perfectly balanced meals.\n\nWe took home a brunch menu  which also looks very intriguing. We will be sampling this at our first opportunity."", ""This is the first time I've ever enjoyed a meal so much but given a low rating. Tavolino is the perfect example of how a single element can ruin an otherwise wonderful meal. That element was a rude owner who visibly treated his staff with disrespect and micromanaged the whole evening in an uncomfortable way.\n\nThe servers were extremely capable and there appeared to be three of them for a busy 35 seat dining room. If you ask me  the server to customer ratio was perfect without this man looming over everyone in the dining room.\n\nWe arrived and were asked by the owner if we had reservation.We told him we did and He proceeded to walk off and top up the wine of another table while waving one of the servers (who was clearly in the middle of something) over to seat us. Not the most welcoming of gestures. We sat down at a nice cozy table and began to decide on wine and dinner choices. \n\nOur servers were all very professional and extremely friendly. We ordered the grilled calamari  Eggplant Parmigiana  Gorgonzola Gnocchi  and the Osso Bucco as well as a bottle Ripasso that the server opened and decanted for us. He was nice enough to leave the bottle on the unoccupied table next to us  but mentioned that if a table came in  he would have to move it back. We appreciated his consideration  but shortly after we heard (and saw) the owner giving him shit for leaving the wine on a different table. There were many instances like this throughout the night.\n\nThey brought out some complimentary bruschetta that was nice while we sipped on our wine and the appetizers were both delicious. But I couldn't help but be irritated by this man who did nothing but point at his staff  treat them with disrespect and act like he was the most benevolent person to ever open a restaurant by lumbering around and trying to suck up to guests by performing useless tasks. Perhaps this sort of treatment and antiquated machismo is okay is rural Italy. If it is  I've never seen it  and certainly being a  business owner calls for better treatment and basic respect of the staff. Especially when the guests can plainly see all of this.\n\nAt one point  this owner came over and picked up our wine from the table beside us and plonked it carelessly on our table and wandered off  not topping up our wine or asking how anything was. It was really rude and I told our server so. The staff were excellent at managing our irritation and did everything they could to make sure that we enjoyed the food and had great service.\n\nThe Osso Bucco was good. I liked how it was served with gorgonzola polenta and rapini-- a little different than the typical risotto that normally accompanies Osso Bucco. Gnocchi was light and pillowy. Sauce could have used a little more salt  but I tend to like things salty. Overall  the food was really well done. Kudos to the chef. Apparently the 'owner' is his brother. \n\nAfter our server had come to top up our glasses with wine  the owner came over and tried to re-do the same task. We asked him not to  because we had just been topped up and wanted to drink slowly. We thanked him for coming over. He grunted and lumbered off. Everything about him was creepy and rude.\n\nLater  I saw him mutter something to our female server and slap her out of the way. She handled everything in stride  and even remarked how she liked him and that was just how he is  but I don't think there is room for this sort of treatment in any workplace. Especially not in such a small dining room where everything is quite obvious to the guests. Regardless  she was a true professional.\n\nDessert was excellent. The flourless chocolate cake was extraordinary.\n\nFive stars to the wonderful servers who did everything they could to make us happy and were all complete professionals. The owner needs have more faith in their skills and leave them to do their jobs.\n\nFive stars for the wonderful food. The chef knows his stuff and is doing great job. The menu is thoughtful and well executed.\n\nI consider bad treatment of staff to be reason enough to never return to an establishment. Especially if I have to witness it with my own eyes. Please  Mr. Owner  leave service in the hands of the professionals you hired and treat them with respect. They work hard and do a great job. I don't want to come back to your restaurant and have to spend my night off feeling bad for everyone who works for you and be annoyed by the fact that you're in the way.\n\nI sincerely hope that the servers are not required to turn in a portion of their tips to this man.\n\nWould I recommend Tavolino? No. Spend your money at a place where you can be sure the staff are respected or  make sure you come in on a night when this owner is not working and tip the staff extra. They deserve it for putting up with this guy.\n\nP.S. Some of the other five star reviews for this place seem pretty spammy  brief and are all written by people with under 6 reviews total. Could easily be fake profiles and reviewers."", 'This is probably my favourite restaurant in this area! Always a great experience and the food is great as well!', 'The food and service were great.  Our waiter Andre\' was a good waiter and the restaurant is a nice place  however; what\'s the deal with the owner ??

Recommend the grilled calamari  bruchetta  and pizza bianca di prochuitto!', 'This review is long overdue  but still fresh in my mind. This is one of those experiences that I have truly struggled with how exactly to capture in words. \n\nI\'ll start by saying that I used a Travelzoo voucher with a work friend. We were both quite recent transplants to the city earlier this year and I was taking advantage of some online deals as a way to explore and save a few bucks. \n\nI know these deals can be hit or miss  but I figure it\'s usually worth it. Usually. In this case  it was not worth the insignificant savings we received for this particular deal. \n\nThe whole meal started out on a bad note. I had forgotten my cell phone at home  which I needed in order to use the voucher. I had mentioned the voucher when I made the reservation and again mentioned it when we were seated. The server asked to see the voucher when we sat down  which of course I couldn\'t show due to not having my phone. My friend said that if we don\'t have the voucher  he would just pay regular price and we\'d come back with the voucher another time. We asked to have a glass of wine to start  but the waiter REFUSED to serve us until we produced the voucher! Of course  this was the most ridiculous thing I\'d ever heard  as we had just said we\'d pay regular price if we couldn\'t get it. But no  he said he wouldn\'t serve us until we could show it. I borrowed my friend\'s phone and managed to access my voucher online to present to the server. He finally conceded to bring our wine. This was the only time I\'d ever been asked to show a voucher before ordering. Usually it\'s given at the end of the meal  so this was very strange. \n\nI had actually looked at the menu online so that I could decide ahead of time what to order. The terms of the deal stated that entrées had to be $24 or less  which did not leave many choices. I was dismayed to find that the restaurant menu (vs online menu) had increased the price of several entrées so they would no longer be eligible for the deal - including the one I had chosen. I asked if I could pay the difference (it was $2) but was refused. I ended up choosing a salmon entrée  which was really good. In fact  all of the food was quite good  most notably the tiramisu  which was made in house that day. \n\nI just can\'t get over how poorly we were treated by the server. I don\'t know if he was the manager or not  but his attitude towards us was horrible. When we asked for more wine  we were told \'no\'. WTH?? No?!? He then said  ""You only get one glass of wine with the voucher."" We had to explain that yes  we understand what\'s included - we\'ll pay for the wine on top of the voucher price. \n\nThe straw that broke the camel\'s back for me  was when the bill came. He had added the tax on the regular price of the food and drinks instead of on the voucher price. When I mentioned his mistake  he literally argued with me and was extremely rude and condescending towards me. I happen to know how these deals work when it comes to tax rules and when I attempted to explain to him  he just kept talking over me  very loudly  telling me I was wrong. Sorry  buddy  you can raise your voice as loud as you want  it doesn\'t make you right. It\'s a good thing for him that my friend paid the bill because at that point I would\'ve given him a zero tip for the way he spoke to me. \n\nThe food here was really very good  hence the two stars. But because of the way this guy treated us  I would never go back. If the restaurant doesn\'t want to honour a discount  then they shouldn\'t offer it in the first place. But they sure as hell shouldn\'t treat their customers poorly just because they take advantage of that discount! And some people really should reconsider being in the hospitality industry when clearly they suck at it.', 'The food was fantastic and the service great. The mussels and the crab tagliatelle were particularly good.']"

About a 15 minute drive north of the Plateau  this bistro is off the beaten path for some Montrealers but the food in addition to the surrounding forest  riverfront  and architecture make it well worth the trip.

Luckily  Burrito Bandidos was not too far a walk  and it certainly did not disappoint. \n\nI ordered a large Mango Chicken burrito  complete with everything  short of jalapenos. I waited around 5 minutes for the order to be completed  which seemed shorter than most of the reviews here. (Although  most of them seem outdated.) The chicken was fairly juicy and tender  and the ingredients tasted fresh. My only complaint would be that the mango chicken was around a dollar more than the regular chicken  and the only thing you got were roughly julienne-d apple mango slices. Nice  tangy addition  but not worth the extra cost in my opinion. \n\nI would drop by again if I was in the area  but I wouldn't go out of my way to return. 4/5"", 'It tastes like Burrito Boyz.   It may not the most authentic (but what do i know)  but its sure tasty. \n\nThey have flavours like spicy pulled prok and mango chicken along with the usual toppings and sauces. Its grilled to a crispy crunchy wrap and served in the paper bag. \n\nThere is limited seating here and gets busy after 12pm. Its an alternative to burgers.', ""I never liked burritos before I tried the mango chicken burrito from Burrito Bandidos! The food here is always delicious  the music is good (and not too loud) and above all  the service is amazing! There has never been a time that I have visited this location and haven't been greeted with warm smiles and incredibly friendly service. They really go above and beyond to ensure that everyone has a pleasurable visit. Even after moving a fair distance away  I find I'm still coming back to this location. Totally worth it!"", 'NOT the best burrito I have had in the city  Fat Bastard definitely takes the prize. But very good.\n\nFresh ingredients - they have all the usual: guac  lettuce  tomatoes  jalapeños  i got the fish which was BEYOND delicious and there was a lot  perfectly battered and fried.\n\nI also like the fact that they have choices of size. Go for the extra large or you will always wonder what could have been...\n\nThe actual inside of the restaurant is pretty small  maybe 12-16 seats? I would suggest getting take out.', 'Extremely slow service. Waited 30 mins for two orders.  Will not come back again. Worst burrito place in town.', ""Amazing!  Large  filling and absolutely delicious.  Quick service and a couple of tables if you want to eat there.  All orders are made fresh in front of you.  And for some entertainment they have different newspaper clippings and articles on the wall that are wacky and outrageous.  A great read while you're waiting for your mouth watering  never disappointing  fulfilling meal."", 'Great to finally have a non-hipsterdufus burrito place a little closer to home. Had a large halibut  and it was awesome & huge. \n\nGreat fish  fresh veggies   solid guac  nice & spicy but not ridiculous.\n\nHave since had a Spicy Pulled Pork as well  and it was delicious as well.', 'Got a small chicken burrito bowl and small spicy pulled pork burrito. Both were delicious but the pulled was definitely the winner! The ingredients were very fresh  love that the guacamole is free and portions were very generous. But it took awhile after ordering to get our food.', ""Good  but not my kind of thing.  The burrito is kind of big.  taste good and fresh.  Just not my type of burrito.  The burrito had too much guacamole for my liking.   Maybe this is a TeX Mex thing.  I'm just use to burritos with more rice.  Its more filling for me."", ""We love this place. So glad I don't have to drive all the way to the West end anymore for a good Burrito. I'm a big fan of the halibut  it's well worth the price. \nThe staff here is always friendly and I would have to say that if you're in a rush call in your order about 10-15 min ahead of time."", ""Banditos has opened another location. This is both good and bad. It's good because maybe it will force Chino Loco's to up their game as they were really the only burrito place in the area until now. This is bad because Burrito Bandito's food is mediocre.\n\nBecause BB's chicken has no flavour and they don't offer a good pork solution  I decided to try the steak and shrimp. I got everything except cilantro and asked for extra hot sauce because I like hot food. The burrito however was not hot. The flavour though was better than previous BB's burritos I've tried and came in at completely average.\n\nAs per other BB's locations they over grill the burrito so that the tortilla cracks and makes a mess. Also keeping with tradition  the person making your burrito asks what you want on your burrito but then ignores what you said and makes the burrito as fast as possible without putting any thought behind it. Two of my friends I was with got things on their burritos that they specifically said they didn't want. Now that I think about  it I'm surprised that my burrito was correct. Though I did say three times that I didn't want cilantro on it. I guess you just have to watch them like a hawk and repeat yourself until they get it.\n\nIf you like mediocre food this is the place for you to go."", 'I would have given this location two stars  except for the terrible customer service I received. \n\nHad a takeout order that they completely messed up. Got the meat wrong  didn\'t put in the tomato or onion and put a veritable mountain of sauce even though it was requested as lightly sauced. That  was problematic in and of itself. But  given it wasn\'t the absolute worst burrito I\'ve had  I could have forgiven it.\n\nHowever  I sent an email to the company to let them know how disappointed I was in my order and my experience. They forwarded my email to the manager of the queen street east location who replied that the mistake was my fault. Not the fault of her ""experienced"" staff member who had to have one of the other staff members help her figure out the order because she couldn\'t follow what was being asked of her. \n\nThat  right there  is reason enough not to go back. In a world where customer service is a priority  the folks at Burrito Bandidos have proven that it is not their priority. \n\nIn a nutshell: mediocre AT BEST food combined with atrocious customer service. Avoid this place.', 'My favourite burrito in town  spend the extra for the halibut.', ""Hi folks -\nI am surprised I am the first person reviewing this new location of Burrito Bandidos.\n\nI am a fan of the Peter Street location  and they now have a location at Queen and Coxwell.\nFantastic to have  a good Burrito spot in the Beach.\n\nLocation has some tall stools with counters.. so you can eat in (at least about a dozen people can).

I usually make the trip to Burrito Boyz and heard that this place was opened by one of the previous owners.  I ordered a regular pulled pork with everything on it.

This place is awesome  went here to grab dinner for me  my boyfriend and 2 friends one night. I ordered the steak  you get to choose whatever toppings you like and I'm pretty simple so I just got cheese  jalapeños  hot sauce  burrito sauce and lettuce. The burrito was like the size of my head and for 2 plus 2 drinks came to $17. Not bad seeing as I could have eaten it for a week. The steak was flavourful and delicious but I warn you  the hot sauce plus the jalapeños was a taddd too spicy for me  so unless you like the eye watering  nose streaming kind of hot I wouldn't recommend the combo.

It was my first time trying the steak burrito and it was bad  the beef tasted like it was very bad grade  it was chewy and dry  in addition I found a hair in my shrimp.  \n\nThis was a food option a year ago when the food quality was much better  it's a shame that the quality has been declining since."", 'The location on queen st e is amazing!

I placed an order for pick up 20 minutes in advance  I show up  pay for my order  they tell me it\'ll be ready right away.  10 minutes later  I ask where it is (I assumed that they forgot to put my order in when I called it in but wanted to give them a break) but when I asked them where it was  it turns out that hey still hadn\'t put my order in!!  So that\'s 40 minutes from when I placed my phone order! \n\nYesterday  I went there with my husband  my 3 year old and 1 year old. My kids\' food was ready right away (small chicken bowl)  then they told me that my order was ready but asked us if we wanted to wait for my husbands order too and they\'d keep my burrito warm for me and they\'d both get called together. (how nice).  A chaotic 20 minutes later of us trying to keep the kids entertained while we waited for my husband\'s chicken burrito  I walked up to the cook and asked him about my husbands order  it turns out that it was ready  sitting in the back  and he just forgot to tell us!  I asked him "" what happened to letting me know when his burrito was ready?"" ""Oh sorry"" was all he said but in that way to just shut me up  and just turned around and walked away. \n\nNever going back again.', 'I have to totally disagree with the single other review posted to this point.  I heard about Burrito Banditos about three weeks ago  and have been about 5 times so far.  \n\nFirst  I love this kind of food  these big burritos assembled to order and pressed on a flat top.  I know its common in many places  but in the GTA its a newish food genre.  Anyhow  I find these things like super comfort food - crispy on the outside  soft and warm and gooey on the inside  and all that with a mix of savoury flavours.  \n\nI don\'t eat meat  so I am really happy that they have a veggie burrito with the ""fake meat\' (soy protein) option.  Though I don\'t eat meat  I do miss the texture of ground meat in something like a burrito or a chili.  I use the same kind of textured soy protein at home in my own cooking.  \n\nAaaanyhow  I got off point.  I like the place  I like the energy  the friendly staff  and the delicious burritos.  If there was one thing I\'d change  I wish they had some sort of a side order  the way you always get fries or rings with a burger.   I\'m not sure what goes with burritos  but one more thing in the mix would kick it up one more notch for me.  Oh  and a beer.  A beer would be good.\n\nTo me  it\'s a great value.  My kids love it  I love it  my buddy loves it.  super yum.', ""G O O D   E X P E R I E N C E: This was my first experience  never had a burrito before this. Amazing first time experience. The place is very clean and everything is presented well. I like that they make it in front of you so you can ask for extras on the stuff you like. I also like that they take phone orders for pick up  defiantly on my new favourites list. Cheap and Cheerful for sure  not so healty  they cut the guacamole with mayo (high bad fat)\n.\nU P D A T E :  B A D   E X P E R I E N C E They seem to be very disorganized.  I've become a regular here  at least twice a week (but not anymore). When they are busy  you will either get the wrong order  wait forever or it will be cold because they pull  it off the grill early because they know you been waiting a long time. My last experience (I won't go back)  I phoned in my order as I always do to save time  they said ready in 10 minutes as per usual (parking is bad in the area).  I arrived 10 minutes later  the place was busy and they were messing up orders as per usual. I waited for 25 minutes on MY PHONED IN  order .  What they dont tell you is that if you phone in your order  you fall to the bottom of the pile. Personally  I think someone that has you on speed dial might be a regular customer and shouldnt be put to the end of the line.  Im not looking for priortiy  but I expect to be placed in line and not bumped.  I felt I had to say something  I politely commented that they are very disorganized and slow. What a mistake this was. It went from simple comment to crime scene in 10 seconds. The cashier exploded and said that I had no reason to be rude. I replied  I'm not being rude  I'm just tired of waiting and need to get back to work.  He insisted I was being rude so I left without my food.  Go when it is slow and it is good. When it is busy  have lots of time on your hands AND DON'T BE FUSSY  you wont leave with your proper order.  I won't go back\n\nUpdate:  I did forward my compliant to their head office by way of email and I was very surprised to get a call from one of the owners. He was generally concerned and wanted to apologize and I accepted and later that day I had a call from the store manager  again it seemed very sincere.

As one of the original FARC girls who love to eat the meat it is so appropriate that my 100th review here at Yelp is all about the carnivore in me.

Medium Rare is a fairly new player on the meat scene going up against the likes of the Healthy Butcher and Rowe Farms but as far as I'm concerned Frank Del Gobbo and his crew at Medium Rare have them beat hands down. MR is known to its customers for its butchery  its charcuterie and its great offering of prepared foods  hence they refer to Medium Rare as a cookery. \n\nThe real thing of beauty at this meat stop and their claim to true meat glory is that the butchery does a dry age cure of the beef. What's super cool is that they have put a window in at the end of the store where they have racks adorned with loins and prime ribs all tagged with aging dates. To quote one of my favorite sista FARC's (and I'll let you guess who that might be) SHUT THE FARM DOOR! I just can't believe what I'm seeing! I just stood there like a small child gazing all starry eyed into the old Eaton's Christmas windows with my little faced pressed up against the glass dreaming of what treasures might come my way.

Perhaps a small prime rib 'o beef? Or maybe a New York strip...just a itty bitty one.  Hell I'd do my best Eartha Kitt rendition of Santa Baby if I thought it'd get me some meat.  \n\nThere is an endless selection of meats that are already vacuumed packed with seasoning such as the Chimichurri beefsteaks. They sell my most beloved Berkshire Pork in this store. The meat counter runs almost the whole length of the shop and this place is the mother lode of high quality  ethically farmed  hormone free  locally raised and harvested meats. Opposite of the butcher case is a full wall of upright freezers filled with everything from desserts to pot pies to seafood. I counted more than 20 kinds of sausages. \n\nFresh prepared foods are also readily available. I took home a bundle of giant Fred Flintstone sized beef ribs and a container of roasted potatoes with prosciutto and herbs. I was told that they have a small smoker on the premises and the ribs I grabbed up had been smoked right there at the store.  Frank Del Gobbo is my meat God. I am not worthy. \n\nAnd for you grass eating  sprout munching bunch of vegetarians  yes there are things for you too. There is a beautiful line of freshly jarred soups and huge gorgeous platters of grilled vegetables.....whatever. Medium Rare has created their own branded line of food products.

I've been in a few times (since I will usually give a place a second or third chance if I like the food) and the blond woman  I presume she is the owner  is horrible. She treats customers as though they are in her way and not worth her time. She will carry on conversations with staff while customers are waiting to ask a question or to pay for their food.

When we entered we were surprised to find it was a ghost town  with two other people at the bar and one person working. I couldn't believe this place was so dead during happy hour!\n\nWe took a seat at the bar and the bartender immediately handed us their beer list and menu. They don't offer a lot of food  just bar snacks and thin crust pizzas. They do have a very extensive beer menu and the prices were excellent. Happy Hour drafts were a little over $4 and canned/bottled beers are always $4. You can't beat those prices! Most of their beers are Ohio breweries. I asked the bartender to recommend a hard cider & he was very familiar with the menu and the beers. He suggested the Rhinegeist Bubbles Rose and it was excellent.\n\nThe space would be great for groups. The place truly feels like an indoor beer garden. There are lots of long picnic style tables + patio seating. They also have arcade games and an indoor shuffle board game. How fun!\n\nWe ordered the prosciutto & Parmesan thin crust pizza to split. The bartender made the pizza and we were able to watch as it went through an oversized toaster oven. It came out piping hot and devilishly cheesy. Perfect to go with our brew! I loved the thin  crispy crust. A single pizza was perfect for us to split without feeling like we had to roll ourselves out the door. We will definitely be back for happy hour or another pre-movie snack."", ""Here's the schtick. 24 taps of craft beer  all from Ohio breweries (you can also get cocktails and wine  but who cares). Picnic tables for sitting  some board games for playing  you can order food from the restaurant next door (The Rail) and have it delivered to you here. There's not much else to say here. I think they used to make and serve pizza here  but the oven set  cold mouth gaping  during our visit. Perhaps it was just down or perhaps they've stopping serving pizza. I don't know and I lacked the interest to dig further.\n\nThe beer selection is pretty damn big  and probably why you'd come here  but so is the beer selection next door at The Rail  which is also serving 24 taps of all Ohio craft beer with the same menu that you have to order from if you want food at the Ohio Beer Garden. See where I'm going here? And if there's cross-over between the beer selections here and at The Rail  well  that makes it less of a reason to come here.\n\nThere's also a pool table which takes up a great deal of floor space and makes it annoying for anyone that happens to be sitting at the picnic table directly next to it. That is unless you're into having a pool cue potentially poked into the middle of your back or want to place yourself in the line of fire of a cue ball rocketing into the back of your skull. People that have been drinking aren't the best pool players  that's all I'm saying.\n\nAnd here's something interesting. We did get to watch a woman pushing a Sears shopping cart wander in and proceed to stare directly at a gentleman that was playing pool with his companion. After about 5 minutes of staring  she turned around and stared up at one of the TVs hanging from the wall by the door for another 15 minutes. The bartender kept looking over at here - as did just about everyone else there - but he never approached her. She eventually took herself and her Sears shopping cart and left. Homeless? Unhinged? Scary? Unsettling? Crazy cat woman? Maybe  maybe not. \n\nI don't know. I'm on the fence here. I mean I want to support our state's breweries  so places like this are a good thing  but right next door to a place that's basically already doing the same thing? Maybe if they had a unique menu or something else that would draw me in. It's a one and done for me.""]"

They were pathetic excuses for a chicken strip. More like a chicken cube. Fat Burger charges the same for a combo and they give you your money\'s worth. It was so disapponting. My bf finished them all in four bites. And the crisscut fries were not very good. They were not hot nor fresh. For the sake of the employees there  I hope quality gets better at this location. They had a friendly staff so the 2 stars are for them and their speedy service. At the rate they are going  they are going to fail at attracting repeat customers and might end up like the previous establishments they\'ve replaced. I\'ve eaten at the sushi restaurant that stood there before and wasn\'t impressed either. Maybe it\'s the location???']"

Been here a few times and find the staff are just chaotic  doesn't seem like they've been given good training even though they are courteous - who does what is not clear. Also don't work well under pressure and get defensive with customers. Weird. Food is fine."", 'Damn  I wish I had checked Yelp reviews first before ordering via Foodora. \n\nOur $50 (+ Foodora cost  tip etc. more than $60) platter for 3 (!!!!) people came a) with a spilled dipping sauce (I am guessing Tahini) and b) without the Fatoush salad which is one of the major menu items and the only green / lettuce part of that platter. \n\nAgain  on Foodora  this platter says it feeds 3 people. However  there were only 1 or 2 items of each. Only 1 beef skewer  only 2 falafels. But thankfully 3 breads and rice. \n\nA major rip-off. Do yourselves a favor. Order anywhere else but here!', 'SUMMARY OF REVIEW: STEER CLEAR OF THIS PLACE! \n\nFULL REVIEW: In hopes of giving the franchise another shot after my previous experience at the Yorkville location  I agreed with my three friends who wanted to brunch there after we learned that the wait at the other brunch places in Liberty Village exceeded an hour and a half. I refrained from writing about my previous dining experience at Yorkville as I did not want to relive it through yelping.\n\nHere goes! Upon arrival  we were seated at our table. After waiting for 15 minutes  we had to ask  the waitress  who was cleaning the table next to us  if she could take our order. She was surprised at our request and immediately looked anxious. Even though she had a notepad in hand and our orders were far from anything complicated (two coffees  two plates of hummus and 4 fattoush salads)  she failed to properly take our order. As I saw the uneasy look on her face  I asked her to read our order to me to confirm. She proceeded to tell me that we had ordered 3 salads. I corrected her and made sure she takes our order for four salads. She made a note on her notepad  nodded and left to punch in the order. Literally 2 minutes later  another server came to our table. ""Can I take your order?"" he asked. \n\nA few minutes later  a couple entered the restaurant and sat right next to us. 15 minutes had passed since we ordered the coffees. The couple had not opened their menus yet  and to their surprise  two coffees and a bread landed on their table. They were ours!!!\n\nAnother 5 minutes lapsed  we had to follow up on the state of our two cups of brewed coffee. The manager said that they are brewing a fresh pot.\n\nLet me also paint a picture of other things that were happening around the restaurant while we were waiting on our food  and oh it was a long wait. Three servers had all huddled up over a single table  one was wiping it up  another was taking the dishes and the third one was setting up the cleaned portions of the table. The manager made sure she bossed the servers around in every chance that she had. \n\nBy the time we got the salads  I had already lost track of time. The salads arrived at our table and guess how many they were? THREE. I was certain that I\'ll get mine in a few seconds. But no  we had to remind three different servers AND the manager about my salad. All four of whom assured me that it was on its way. Not one of them actually went and check on my salad or even ensure that the order was correctly punched in. My friends dined  and I was sucking on pita bread for an hour. \n\nYou\'d think that since we interacted with multiple servers  one of them checked up on us during our meal. BUT YOU\'RE WRONG. Not a single soul made eye contact with us outside the times I was yelling ""Excuse me  where\'s my salad?""  let alone check up on us to make sure we didn\'t need anything else. \n\nAnyways  excited to get out of the place  we asked for the bills. In the interest of your time and my own  I\'m not going to elaborate on the complications that the server faced trying to split the three salads and two orders of hummus between the four of us. After doing 2 trips to the cash  he finally handed us the bills. Mine came up to 11 dollars because I paid for the hummus and my coffee. I gave him a 20 dollar bill. Waiting for him to give me my change  he said goodbye and wished us a nice day. I asked him if I could get 5 dollars back. He apologized and ran back to the counter to get me my change. We waited and waited and waited.\n\n...And waited. I walked up to the counter  asked him if everything was okay. I also told him if he could give me the change so we could leave and that he could do his accounting stuff later. He said he\'d be right with me. \n\nWe waited another ten minutes to the point that we engaged in a full conversation about the beer festival happening outside with the guys sitting next to us. I walked up to the counter again. I told the manager that we couldn\'t stay there any longer as our parking session was expiring soon. The manager asked our server to give ""any five dollar bill"" to me and to sort out whatever problem he was having later. He obliged. The manager gave me a mini box of baklava to thank me for my patience and apologized for the service that we (did not) receive. I hope she reads this review.', ""The food is decent  but I have not once received a takeout order without something missing that I've asked for. I'm giving this such a low rating though because the service is absolutely TERRIBLE. Like  embarrassingly so. One girl that works the cash is insanely rude and can't seem to do simple math when it comes to giving customers their change  and I've gone in multiple times when there have been less than 3 tables of customers in the entire restaurant  and each time it has taken over half an hour for a shawarma. HALF AN HOUR. For a SHAWARMA. I mean  come on. Each time they say it will be quick  and I end up sitting for ages like an idiot. Why do I go back  you ask? Because I like shawarma  and I'm lazy. (They're right beside my building.) I've learned that I need to call at least half an hour in advance and cross my fingers they omit the pickles  as I've asked them to do. I really feel that they're only still open because of lazy people who don't want to venture out of the Village for middle eastern  but sooner or later  if the crappy service keeps up  even bums like me will get fed up and start looking elsewhere."", ""What a disappointment!  I had a good meal at Paramount Brampton and was looking forward to sharing the same with a group of Toronto friends.  No comparison!  I ordered the Fatoush salad and like previous comments it was overpriced for what I got  too much dressing and not authentic and literally 6 small pita bits added.  My beef kabob on top had to be cut into tiny pieces to make it chewable and the whole thing was overpriced.  There were 8 of us and the dinners arrived in series so that some of us could wait and could  eat cold food  or we could eat while the others waited.  The server was pleasant  but couldn't keep the orders straight and totally confused the bills  the kitchen was slow and disorganized and the food was less than mediocre.  Only the bill was over the top!  Definitely not up to PARAMOUNT standards!.  We will not be going back."", 'Wow. This place is horrendous. If you are considering trying Paramount Fine Foods Liberty Village I would strongly urge you to reconsider. There is absolutely nothing ""fine"" about the food at this place. Frankly it couldn\'t be further from ""fine"". The attention and care this place puts into the quality and taste of their food is about the same attention you would expect a heroin addict to pay to the cleanliness of the needle they use. I ordered a chicken shawarma plate with fries and a shish tawook plate with white rice. What little chicken there was among the pile of crap I got served was hard  cold  and dry as if it were a week old.    If I could give lower than a one star rating I would. Avoid at all costs.', ""Gord and I had supper this evening at Paramount Fine Foods in Liberty Village.  It's a chain and this location has been opened since August.\n\nGord and I split an order of Hummus with Chicken.  I love hummus and pita bread and this was delicious.  The pita bread is freshly made and was warm when it arrived.  Not only did we finish it but we asked for extra pita bread.\n\nGord ordered Taliyeh Saj Chicken Shawarma Wrap.  He said it was good and took half home for his lunch tomorrow.  He thought it could have been hotter so perhaps it was sitting around for a while.  He also ordered a Jellab.\n\nThere was a lot on the menu to choose from.  I ordered the Mixed Grill and thought it was okay.  I found it was a bit on the cool side so perhaps it too was sitting around for a while.  I thought the shish tawouk (chicken) was the best of the meat ... it was tender and tasty.  The beef was a bit bland and had a funny texture.  The kafta (ground beef) was interesting.  The garlic sauce was really garlicy.  It was a large portion and because I had so much of the appetizer  I was full and left most of the rice and bread.\n\nMario and Mohamed were our servers.  They were friendly and helpful."", 'I received an email from the owner offering me a free meal  with the statement ""Although the quantity will be the same  the quality will be better"". Hmmm  what is this supposed to mean?  Either way  I don\'t want the free meal  I stand by my review and the false advertising in the menu.', ""I actually thought this place was great - not sure why all the other reviews are so negative!\nWe went here on a nice summer night and sat on the patio. The service was excellent from the waiter  and the manager even came out to check on us at one point. The food was hot and fresh when it came out - we ordered a few apps and one main course.

I heard the plates are way better', ""I've been to several Paramount's before and enjoyed the food and service. This location was disappointing. The service - while they were trying - was subpar and the food was not good at all. I'm not sure why this is so inconsistent with other locations. I had assumed they just opened but that was not the case."", 'I\'ve been to the other Paramount Fine Foods on Yonge Street.  But today I decided to try the Liberty Village one.  I used the remainder of my Ritual credit here.  Which was great because through the Ritual app  I was able to preorder my food for pick up and got to use a Ritual Exclusive Perk which gave me a discount on a food item that was regularly more in price.   You can do the same and if you use my code ""Jenny1354""  you\'ll get $10 to try this app.  \n\nAnyways the restaurant was quite nice and clean (and new).  It wasn\'t busy.  So the 2 staff members greeted me and were super friendly. Even went to check on the status of my food to rush it through.  The had some high tables/stools where you can sit and wait at.  They offered free tea while waiting.  Service wise  it was fantastic.  I couldn\'t have asked for better.  \n\nFood wise  a bit disappointed.  The take out dishes we got were both platters.  It felt that the portion was not well done.  I had 6 huge falafels on my platter (check out my pics) but perhaps a tablespoon of lettuce  one slice of tomato and a few pickled items.  I\'d would had rather only have 3 falafel\'s (they were tasty and well made) and more lettuce/tomatoes  or even some rice/potato or even tabbouleh.  The pita was good.  I received 2 of the small containers of hummus dip/sauce but no garlic sauce.  One of each would had been better.  I think a side of spicy sauce would had been nice to add.   \n\nThey did include sufficient napkins and fork/knife with my pick up order which was nice.  It was in a nice take out container with a bottom plate that was paper so then compostable/recyclable.', ""Food: horrible  tasted like everything was microwaved and none of the staff knew English. \nService: horrible \nNot much else to say about here. Definitely wouldn't go here again."", ""I came to eat here Saturday afternoon. Restaurant wasn't busy but the service was bad. I had to ask 2 servers to get a refill on water  they spend a lot of time chatting to each other or simply doing something else besides serving customers. \n\nFood wasn't worth the price. Mixed grill platter was around $24? The 4 skewers of meat were small and so dry  not even hot. Lukewarm at best  seems like it was cooked before and just re-warmed. Not fresh. So dry it was hard to swallow! \n\nThey get 2 stars for the appetizer mezza plate  I enjoyed the dips and the free fresh pita bread.

This place is not the best restaurant in Toronto  but definitely not the worst either.  Looking closer at the reviews  it seems lots of reviewers with 1 or few reviews - maybe revenge reviews from a competitor? That would be a pretty crappy behavior - Yelp is not the place to settle petty competition.\n\nThis place is the former Vespa Pizzeria  and it looks much better after Paramount renovated it  very upscale look inside.  The service is a bit hectic around the Liberty Village lunch hour  but not bad at all  which makes me doubt all these reviewers below who gave it 1* for bad service.\n\nThe menu is quite extensive and has lots of variations on shish kebabs and shawarma.  The food is good  the portions are big  and the owner is always on-hand  running around and being friendly to all customers.  \n\nMy order was mistaken  they brought me Mixed Shawarma  while I actually ordered Mixed Grill  so the owner made sure I got my plate and then he also packed the wrong plate to go  as a freebie for me.  That was mighty nice  especially since it is the first time I step into the place  or see the guy.\n\nThe pricing is a bit on the high side ($23 for Mixed Grill)  but for a full dining experience in LV it is not that bad. \n\nAgain  the crappy competition seems to be filling the Yelp reviews with 1* - really crappy behavior that Yelp should sanction.', ""Ordered in from Paramount recently  and I was quite impressed! It's always a mission to find food that will stand the test of delivery time and give you great leftovers. Paramount held up quite nicely  and I appreciate that.\n\nI got a chicken shwarma plate  which was very well packaged and tasty. However  when I want this type of food... I really want the sauces! ALL the sauces. The plate came with garlic sauce on the side (rare to find in Toronto)  but I needed more! I also ordered the Mezze Plate and it came with hummus  moutabbal  and tabouleh. Such a gorgeous plate! The hummus was slicked with olive oil  paprika and a few tray whole chickpeas. The tabbouleh was super fresh with large pieces of chopped parsley. Also amazing was the moutabbal  which brings baba ganoush to mind. This was also cutely decorated with a sprinkle of pomegranate seeds. Yum!

You can never have too many dips!!!"", 'The service is crap ( although they try hard)  the food is shoddy  and the wait is always long.', ""Wasn't too impressed. \n\nThe waiter we had was extremely awkward and made the experience feel awkward and kind of uncomfortable. I don't think they were comfortable in that role. \n\nThe food...too over priced for what you get. I ordered Fattoush Salad with chicken. The salad was eh - not that good - had the dressing but almost just tasted like a garden salad; the ingredients weren't soaked in the dressing so it didn't taste like a regular Fattoush to me  and I only got 4 tiny pieces of chicken on the salad. Those 4 pieces of chicken cost $6.99 to add to the $7.99 salad (pictures included in my review). \n\nBy the time you order 2 main entrees  your better off getting a platter - way better deal. Don't think the platter should be cheaper than 2 meals considering the platters come with a lot more food.

We tried it out today  now that it is open  and were let down in a big way.\n\nThe nice glossy menu shows HUGE portions of beef and chicken atop a great looking salad  also 5 various wraps over flowing with meats and vegetables.  Well I'll tell you that you don't get what is advertised.  A slim version of what you see.  All sorts of flair and glam in the restaurant and no show.  \n\nThe flavour was OK but it really is just a snack  for the price (Liberty Village $$$$ Price) of a full dinner.  You will be left hungry and going elsewhere for more food.  Go elsewhere first  don't waste a stop here.\n\nI don't recommend this place to eat.  You can do MUCH better at other local establishments."", ""This location is a piece of shit. I did an Uber eats on here and they didn't deliver half my order.

I feel like they spent more on the interior designer than on quality staff and food. Countless times they forgot my order! Yes I waited and waited as I'm too polite to say anything. Anything time it came late and burnt. On a different occasion they for my father in law order but not mine or my husbands. How does that happen. The service is very rude and off putting.

After I got my order which again I payed just under 70 bucks for  ONE OF THE MAIN ENTREES I ORDERED WASNT THERE. I called and spoke to the ""owner"" who first told me I could come drive there and pick it up. I told the wonder that to drive there and pick it up would be absurd  as the entire REASON I payed extra for delivery was that I was working late and could not leave. Then the wonder told me to call UBEREATS and said it was the fault of UBEREATS.Then the owner said he would maybe drive the food over to me  but then he said that THE KITCHEN WAS CLOSED AND THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO. He told me that the next day I could call and he would deliver the one item. It meant one of the people that was with me had to share an entree and we were both still hungry. I don\'t need to get fooled more than once to know that this place is a fucking mess and can\'t even complete a simple order. The food is inconsistent and not even good. It\'s also heavily overpriced. Fuck this place.', 'New to Liberty village  this Paramount location seems just like the others. We dropped in unexpectedly and were looking forward to familiarly tasty Lebanese fare. \n\nThe place is visually appealing.  And the owner came up to say hello and welcome us. A very nice touch.  The resto was quite empty when we came in and slowly started filling in. I think we had four eager servers. \n\nFood came out quick and the only issue was no dressing on our fattoush salad. But that was remedied quickly. \n\nOverall food was good. No major issues. The chicken was cooked very well.  The rest was ok. I like fries and their fries are always a little underwhelming. Although we liked it we were not thrilled. Perhaps a few small things could have gotten a 4th star but we felt it was a solid 3 this time.', 'Our food was excellent.  We both got chicken schwarma.

I ordered and they said it would take 15. Fine. I arrive exactly at the 15 minute mark and still had to wait another 11 minutes. THE WHOLE POINT OF RITUAL IS TO GIVE ACCURATE PREP TIMES. YOU CAN PICK WHATEVER NUMBER YOU WANT. If you need 20 min  or 25 min... just select that! Then people will leave home/work accordingly  to time that out. I don\'t need a server walking up to me every 3 or 4 min with a ""it will be a few more minutes  sir.""\n\nThis was all compounded by the fact they were pretty dead. Two tables of people  but both already had their food. Two people were waiting for their order when I walked in. That\'s not a lot of business. Plus I used an app where they get to SPECIFY how long they need  and they still failed to meet it.\n\nFood: B+\nI\'ve harped on this place before (both the service and food at their other location were underwhelming) but my experience food-wise was actually pretty good this time. I was very full by the time I was done. The chicken and beef were both juicy and flavourful (the beef was the better of the two) and the rice was plentiful and nice  although I needed to add salt/pepper to help give it flavour. The pita was large and actually quite fresh.\n\nMy complaints: the salad was boring. It was basically just shredded lettuce with two spears of pickle and turnip on the side. No dressing. That\'s not a salad. I can shred my own iceberg lettuce at home -- that doesn\'t make it a ""salad"". Also  the amount of tahini sauce you get is pathetic. The amount of garlic dip was fine  but I could have used like 3x tahini sauce for the amount of food.\n\nValue: D\nEvery review seems to say \'overpriced\'  both for the quality and quantity. I\'m judging this on the actual menu price... which is NOT worth $15.99. As full as I was (mostly on rice and pita bread  mind you)  $18 after taxes per person for take out? Wow. I don\'t know if the prices were jacked up for LV  but I wouldn\'t pay more than $9.50 for that. I\'m glad I had the 50% off deal  but I probably won\'t return at those prices.\n\nOverall: B\nI think this is my first review breaking things down and giving letter grades lol  but I felt it was needed to differentiate the fact the food itself was rather pleasant  but the customer service and value was not.\n\nConclusion:\nI won\'t likely go back because it would be twice the price  and it\'s not worth that. If they want my business  they\'d need to lower their prices. Which they won\'t.', ""Food:4/5\nService:2/5\n\nUpon arriving I used the washroom and found no toilet paper.

We waited a full HOUR for our meals to arrive  in the meantime putting up with huffy  eye-rolling waitstaff. It's too bad because when the food arrived? It was pretty good. Sorry Paramount  you need to teach your staff some manners and get organized."", ""I've been here twice now. Gave it a second chance.\n\n1st visit at lunch they served me two undercooked chicken thighs. Clearly pink in the middle despite the meal taking over 25 minutes after ordering in a mostly empty restaurant. The server took a bad situation and made it worse by taking forever to rectify.\n\n2nd visit at lunch they served me undercooked beef kofta and there were three big chunks of bone in what I did eat of it before realizing the middle was still raw. I'm not sure how they even tried to cook it because there were barely any grill marks. Microwaved then grilled seems likely  yet still undercooked!? Again  the sever left me sitting there for 15 minutes waiting to hear back about the undercooked kofta that she returned to the kitchen....!?\n\nNot sure if there will be a third visit. I really like middle eastern food  and wish this place was better. Undercooked meals and untrained service staff are a bad combo!"", ""I'm a big fan of Paramount Fine Foods  and now that they are full service  I'm even more a fan! \nI have  experience working in the restaurant industry  and I'm too familiar with how tough it is to open a new store in an already established business district  AND work with the quirks of an unfamiliar store. Despite it being a new store  and the staff all being quite young  my experience was phenomenal. I ordered the falafel plate and the cheese and zaatar mana2eesh. The food was amazing  and my server was really friendly and I could see that all the staff were helping each other out - which is great! \nI will be back far too often!"", 'This place needs a new manager. Went in with some friends who were getting their food to go. They ordered 3 chicken shawarmas 10 minutes before I ordered and received them 20 minutes after I got my food. The waiter forgot to add the cheese I requested and it had to be sent back to the kitchen. There was also garlic sauce on my shawarma when I specifically asked for none. My gf ordered tabouleh and it never came out so after a while we asked about it and the waiter said ""oh you actually wanted that.."" I don\'t understand what he was writing on the paper because he seemed to forget everything we said. 10 minutes later he came back to ask us if we still wanted it. We said yes and received the worst tabouleh ever. Our glasses were constantly empty and I had to ask several times through the meal to get more water. This process is pretty simple... remember what people order and make sure a glass of water is never empty. This all happened while the place was empty. There seemed to be a discconect between the wait staff and the kitchen. 30 minutes for a chicken shawarma is absolutely unacceptable. Shawarmas typically takes anywhere from 1-3 minutes ...this is what people expect... if you can\'t do it then please close your doors. There was also an uber eats delivery man there. He went up and asked for his order four times while he waited for a half hour. How does this happen when the restaurant is empty. The few people in the bar were scattered throughout the restaurant..maybe you should sit people in one section  to avoid slow and confusing service. Overall the food was a 7 out of ten and the service was -100. If things don\'t change this place will be shut down within a year. There is no way that this place is not a drug front.']"

A lot of people were coming up the counter asking for their food and how long more it will take.\n\nI've ordered take-out for a soy hot chocolate and egg salad sandwitch.  \n\nThe sandwitch was overpowered by pepper. The hot chocolate has a large lump of chocolate at the bottom.  If i'm paying $6 more then it would cost me @starbuck/second ... they could at least stir it fully for the chocolate to melt.  \n\n$8 dollar egg salad which I can easily make for $2 at home using specialty bread shouldn't be overly peppered and they should offer the option of toasting the bread.  \n\nNo repeat customer from my end."", ""This place only recently opened but it gets really busy. It's also pretty small so the tables fill up very fast. Regardless  you should dine in because the store is really nice and has good vibes. Menus are hard to read (maybe because I need new glasses) so they have a few mini menus in front of the cash register. The staff was nice but service could have been faster.\nI got a medium Iced Chai Latte ($4.65) good but very light chai flavour. I wish the taste was a little stronger because all the ice diluted the taste even more. \nThe Shakshuka ($9.95) was pretty good. It's two eggs in a warm red pepper and tomato sauce served with tahini and bread. It was tasty and very aromatic. I loved that the egg yolks were still runny because last time I got it at a different location  the yolks were fully cooked. They also gave more bread than I needed. \nAlthough I had a good experience  my friends did complain about the sandwiches being very small so keep that in mind when ordering them."", ""I used to go there everyday since it located right close to my residence. I think the service is great. The boss of this store is kind and open-minded. They will serve you with great attitude. \n\nThe coffees for sure are the best play in the store. I would think the drinks are way better than the food. However  it seems that some bartenders didn't know the menu really well. Sometimes they would offer me different kind of coffee. Clearly  they don't drink that much coffee as I do. I believe some bartenders didn't know the difference between Cortado and Canadiano. Overall  the foods are little pricy while the quality is just like average. Salad is the best choice for this store. Pancake and sandwich get pretty natural taste.

It's located in the bottom of a student apartment building along with a number of other new food places.  I enjoy a few things about aroma which is their coffee  breakfast  and the water they always have available.  The chocolate that comes with your coffee always makes me smile because it reminds me of Europe.  I do think the sandwiches are highly overpriced but they do taste decent."", ""Great place to hang out in a relatively quiet environment. They have a large seating space and with benches in the middle that can easily accommodate a group of 10-12 people  this place is a great for large groups as well. \n\nWe tried their Cortado with Soy Milk and Ice Aroma Light (with Soy Milk). Cortado was really great- the second best I have had to date (still not compared to the best Cortado I have had in Kentucky US). Ice Aroma Light was okay. It was supposedly less sugar but it still tasted quite sugary. A good drink on a hot day though. \n\nOverall  it's a nice place to hang out with friends or even if you are on your own.""]"

They have happy hour prices on a couple of beers (I believe Yuengling and something else)  and several others on draft  including at least one Great Lakes beer  which satisfied me. \n\nThey also have daily specials  and the night I was there it was 50 cent wings of about a dozen types. I ordered some in a style I had never had before  lemon pepper.

This was 30 minutes after we had placed our orders! Another meal was never made  so the two steaks came out about 15 minutes later  but they were horribly cooked. The management almost didn't compensate us for both meals  but eventually did.

Another 30 minutes later my meal arrived. Luckily I didnt have another match in the tournament for a while or I would have missed it. The food was actually decent and the portion size was pretty big. The prices were a bit inflated though. 20.00 for Fish and rice and veggies. \n\nThe next day I had lunch with a friend in there. Different server but same situation. Instead of them asking what we would like to drink or even giving us a menu they decided to clean the bar and the floor. After about 20 minutes of that we finally got offered drinks and a menu. The drinks were served in plastic solo cups. Now im not a snob... but if the items on the menu are averaging between 15.00-25.00 then I would hope to get an actual GLASS. And again  the food took an extremely long time to get to us. 30 minutes to make a caesar salad and a quesadilla?? \n\nThe part we really had an issue with was the staff member was not being very sanitary. While she was cleaning  someone ordered so olives with a drink  she proceeded to grab a giant jar of them and then reach her bare hand into the jar and start rooting around for a handful  and then dropped them into the drink.

Looking at the Yelp reviews  we figured it would be a decent place to get food from as the ratings were fairly high. However we were wrong.\n\nUpon scanning the menu  it seemed decent. Prices were a bit high but we figured it would still be cheaper than dining-out. We made a $50 purchase which included 5 rolls and a beef teriyaki bento box.\n\nThe beef teriyaki bento box was $16.95 so we figured there would be quite a bit of food. However  we got about 7 small strips of beef drenched in sauce. The beef was chewy and difficult to eat. The amount of rice was unimpressive and the miso soup was grainy and unpleasing. The bento included 5 pieces of sushi (3 salmon and 2 shrimp) and a 4-piece California roll. The sushi was quite small and the salmon was cut really thin. It was nothing special. I don't like California rolls as I'm a fan of raw fish so I don't want to give a bias review on the Cali rolls. Overall  it was a pathetic amount of food that didn't even taste that good.\nWe struggled to finish the food  not because there was too much but because we found it difficult to get down. The spicy salmon rolls we ordered didn't taste very fresh and we felt sick after eating the meal. \n\nWe easily spend $50 when we dine out for sushi but the quality we get is so much better.

It's especially pleasant to sit outdoors in the fall and spring months.\n\nThe indoor seating area is also very nice  with a choice of table chairs or lounge chairs.  \n\nI have no complaints with the baristas  who are always friendly and prepare my caffe americano the way I like it."", ""Cleanest and quickest Starbucks . I ordered a venti iced chai before I was done paying I had it in my hands ! So much space inside and outside to sit but it does seem like it's everyone spit at 8:30 am !"", ""The service here as always been prompt and the drinks were made appropriately. What I like about this location is the outdoor patio. The store is located on the corner with the patio out front surrounding the store. So there is a wide view with a lot of trees and greenery. The intersection is right there but it's not that busy. It's nice to sit outside here."", ""Been here weekly  if not more often  since moving into the area. It's quite a nice store  with lots of seating (couches!) outside. It does seem they are encouraging patrons to stick around and stay a while with this layout! It's also a popular place with the laptop crowd. Most times I've been here there hasn't been much of a wait  but I'm not a morning person! Good thing they serve coffee all day  haha! \n\nThe location at the corner of the shopping center is kinda convenient too  especially to combine trips with the grocery and drug stores nearby. I like the promotions Starbucks does  such as the current half price Frappuccinos from 3-6 daily. When they changed their star rewards program  it became a little confusing  but I've had lots of offers since then. Getting freebies from earned stars is a nice perk  and I enjoy redeeming those!"", ""I visit Summerlin a couple times a year for a week or so at a time and I go to this Sbux daily - they often remember my drink and my name even though I'm not local.

Sadly that is all the nice things I have to say about this place. \n\nThey capitalize on the fact that they are the closest option for people that work in DES and the surrounding buildings.  It is overpriced cafeteria food.  I went by today and tried a bacon cheeseburger with no fries.  I was shocked when it rang up $7.50. The check out lady asked Val if that was right and she agreed.  I stepped out of line to check the price board and sure enough it was.  As I am walking back to line I hear Val walking away singing to herself ""I know what I\'m talking about"".  I can\'t even fathom how she treats her employees with an attitude like that. I know the customers are getting screwed. \n\nThere are trophies all over the place with her name on it dated 5+ years ago. Funny how nothing is recent and there are no awards for any of the employees.  There are signs at every station blaming the recent economic crunch for the rise in prices.  Half expecting tip jars to show up asking you to help her pay her employees.', 'Do you like mediocre food and lots of cumin? then Val\'s is right for you.

I think there was cumin in the lasagna.', ""This is actually one of the nicest cafeterias located on a job site that I have ever visited. It's nice and clean  their selection isn't huge  the staff is great and the owner is even more amazing. I gave 3 starts because for many of their items  your being doubled charged than if you were going to a convenience store.

Only second time here  I had the chicken cranberry salad as well and it was very delicious.', ""Is ok but the important thing to remember is beggars can't be choosers. \n\nThis is really just your typical cafeteria with noting extra of flashy. I would argue they do breakfast better than lunch. But with that said please don't get your hopes up. \n\nBut it is important to remember that in the Capitol mall area the choices are extremely limited so at times this is the best you can get."", 'I only come here when there are no other options. Everything here is just bland or bad. DES stands for Die and Eat Sh*t  by the way  in no particular order.', 'Below average food above average prices.  Order a pizza once but the cardboard box tasted better.  Cashier is friendly but that does not help other the food.  Burger patties are precooked.  Not sure if I would purchase one.  On Thursday they sell sub sandwiches they are not too bad.', 'Believe it or not  of all the capitol cafeterias Vals is the best.  It\'s like a food court combined with a convenience store.  It has ample seating  outdoor seating  and sells more than salad and hot meals.  You can also pick up lottery tickets  fresh popped corn  fruit  coffee  ice cream  candy bars  peanuts  chips  donuts  cookies  custard  and more.  \n\nThe food is for folks who don\'t mind eating just average meals.  There\'s a small serve yourself salad bar and three stations for food.  At one  all the frying happens.  At another they serve the light daily ""specials"" like personal pizzas  greek salad  mexican fiesta bowl  and sub sandwiches.  The third is for daily soups and heavy entrees like fried chicken  lasagne  fish that are served with a side of potatoes  cole slaw  or veggies.\n\nAverage cost for a full lunch will set you back about $7.  Clean up begins at 2 pm and the place is shut down at 3 pm.', ""Oh the DES cafe  how you've kept me from starving so many times.  Located in the capital mall  the DES cafe feeds hundreds of government employees and capital workers daily.  Offering a wide range of foods  it's a one stop shop for all things sustenance.  \n     The menu consists of whatever they can make  and by this I mean anything.  Whether it's the daily special like baked chicken or fried fish  or something simple like a burger and fries. The kitchen will cook it if they have the ingredients.  In terms of taste and quality  the food is very basic.  It's seasoned lightly but is made with real meat and vegetables  and the average meal is very balanced in terms of portion and nutrition.  If you order a daily special   you can expect each meal to contain: a starch  a protein  and a vegetable.  An example would be a baked chicken breast and wing  a side of mashed potatoes  and a mixed steam vegetable.  So if simple and nutritious is your thing  you should be right at home.\n     The atmosphere is what I would describe as school cafeteria for adults.  It's a bunch of folks looking to fill the void  socialize and get back to the grind.  So it helps to know what you're getting before jumping in line.  Thankfully a menu is posted right at the serving area  and all the other options are other wise displayed on the screens or labeled accordingly.\n     Overall I cannot find any real complaints with the cafe.  The staff is very friendly  but they are also very efficient.  So if they seemed a little rushed to get your order  it's only because there's another 300 people behind you ready to order."", 'Always enjoy the service provided here. Everyone is so nice and helpful.  You have a wide variety of food options from different sized salad bar with chicken to soup and plenty of entrees including pizza  wraps  sandwiches  burgers and the best specials. I always enjoy the quality and quantity of the food for the price.', ""I gave my 3 stars due to the lack of assembly line I'm used to in a normal cafeteria.  My elementary school was more organized than this place.  \n\nIt was so busy with no guidelines showing people where the line starts and ends.  (Hate that).  You have people waiting 3 different lines for the same cook...  You also have people getting upset because since they took long to order people pretty much cut in front of them... \n\nI ordered a roast beef sandwich for $4.. The food was ok but could have been better.  \n\nThe sitting area was nice with outdoor seating... Since I love to people watch it was fun.  Will I come back again?  Probably not- unless I really had to."", ""Unfortunately for those who work within the walls of the DES main building  there are not a lot of options  there are not a lot of decent places around to eat without driving.  \n\nThis place is mediocre on a good day and is also very overpriced.  I don't know of many other places that will nickel and dime you for condiment packets and plastic silverware. Their grill items are greasy  the salad bar is boring without much variety  the pizza is tasteless  and the burgers are cooked the night before and left in a pan of water then heated up when ordered.  I actually got ill a couple years ago here  and then after some things I saw behind the cook line I filed a health department complaint  but I don't think it has helped.\n\nSo  if you're in the neighborhood  beware."", ""Over priced low quality food. This is really taking advantage of state employees. There are many other cafe's in the area with better food and prices. If this place was a stand alone rest yeah it would be struggling for business.

For $13  we got a teeny tiny piece of cheese  four thin slices of not-so-good sopressata  stale bread  2 crackers  raw unsalted almonds  six grapes  and about half a jar of very oniony cornichons!

Looking at the menu the first item that caught my eye was the chilaquiles for $10. I've had it at a different restaurant and had to try it for comparison purposes. It was quite unique in that the tortillas was cut up strips and fried. Some were covered in Oaxaca cheese and cotija  cheese and red pepper coulis with some shredded green chili pulled pork hidden here and there and a sunny side up egg on top and some sauce. Not too bad. It could have had a little more sauce for the extra fried tortillas and a little bit more pulled pork.

The radicchio was delicious  but I didn't care much for the pomegranate pistachio cous cous it came with. \n\nWe skipped dessert and tried to get cappuccino but the cappuccino machine wasn't working  so finished with some coffee.  Overall it was a nice evening out  would probably prefer to sit outside next time instead of inside and hopefully well be able to try everything we come in for next time!"", 'I love Vintage 95!  They have great food and I love their wine selection.  I enjoy sitting down and have some wine in the back with the big firepits they have.  On a cool winter nights   I fun to sit in the back under the stars drinking wine.', ""Been here several times and was only disappointed in the guys who took me there on a date.\n\nThey have moscow mules in REAL copper mugs!!! 5 stars in the bag  'nuff said.\n\nThe bruschetta. Is. The. Bomb. I lurve the bacon jelly/goat cheese and the date/pistachio/masrcopone ones. The others are simply slightly less awesome. I have enjoyed the duck (ate some off his plate) and the flatbread. \n\nTheir drink menu is excellent  lots of unique mixes with quality booze like all the classy ladies like. I don't have a good wine knowledge-base but I hear they have a decent selection  the house cab was yum. Beers are limited for those who like Budweiser or Coors  you will be challenged.\n\nThe setup outside is my fave  so much so that I've never sat inside. I like the comfy seats and the toasty fire pits. It's all very cozy and romantic. The tall heaters are nice but most of them look like the need to be euthanized. HELLO OWNERS  those aren't attractive . . . kind of creepy actually. \n\nAlas  still 5-star worthy."", 'I am far from a food-snob. I am much more likely to enjoy a PB&J at home then eat at some expensive and fancy 5-star restaurant. Go ahead  call me unrefined if you must.\n\nI took the girlfriend here to try something new. The experience was cool but I didn\'t particularly get enthused by the food. It wasn\'t bad... it just wasn\'t to my liking. With that said  the GF liked it. We ordered the bruschetta which was totally different. You actually pick 4 flavors out of 6 flavors - mix and match how you like. The flavors were not what I was expecting. We got the  Pistachio  Date and Marscarpone; House Made Ricotta  Heirloom Tomatoes and Basil Vinaigrette; Tenderbelly Bacon Jam and Whipped Goat Cheese; and the Prosciutto  House Made Ricotta and Fig Honey. The prosciutto was by far the most ""normal"" of the bunch in my opinion. The tenderbelly bacon jam one was interesting - like a smoky  meat  jelly concoction that really didn\'t make sense to my tastebuds but was still good. The pistachio one felt like I was eating a gooey trailmix blend on a piece of bread. Again  not bad but just not my style. Maybe someone who likes the finer things in life would enjoy them more than I did. Your mileage may vary and I think I would have enjoyed the bowl of olives more.\n\nI ordered the brazilian steak and the GF ordered the watermelon salad. For mine the brazilian steak was  again  different. It was more like a raw beef hamburger than a steak. Very flavorful but I could have used it less juicy/messy than it was. Still good. I\'d get it again. The GF loved her salad.\n\nIn general I kind of want to give it a 3 star review. It just wans\'t anything that wowed me. However  I feel like I walked into someplace that I knew was different and I got what I thought I was going to get... something different. I can\'t knock a place for doing what they do any more than I can knock McDonalds for not being a 5-star restaurant. For what it aims to be I think it does a very good job at. I\'m not hankering to go back but if the GF wants to go back then I\'d like to try something different there...\n\n... maybe the Queen Creek Olives  Italian Flatbread  Salmon  or vintage Burger.', ""Went here for a birthday party. What a lovely place! Nice decor. The staff are all very friendly and welcoming. The wine was delicious. We got sandwiches for lunch- very very good! The S'more desert was drool worthy. I'll go back if I ever get a chance too."", 'This place is awesome. Great wine selection  great food  and great service.  Try the filet.  Phenomenal!  Highly recommend!  While we waited for our food for a long long time  we talked to the owner and he comped our stakes. Good place!', ""Giving these guys five stars because I can't think of anything that would have made our experience any better.  We sat on the patio in the back which is right against a parking lot but we quickly forgot that. The atmosphere was relaxed and rustic. Our sever John had the perfect balance of attentiveness without our party feeling rushed or bothered. The Bruschetta is the star and a must try! Be brave and try them all. We also had the watermelon salad and tomato bisque followed by the duck and short ribs. Everything on the menu was a taste adventure. I will be back for sure. It was a delightful experience."", 'Went there tonight ( Wednesday)  it was so relaxing.  Celebrating a mellow a birthday with wine and girlfriends. Service was excellent and price great. Wed they have happy hour 4pm-close. Nice wine selection and tasty food. Will go back. Hubby will like the beer selection and Scotch.', 'Great little place to eat in ""old town""  Chandler.  The meat and cheese plate is pretty good-- certainly one of the best I\'ve had in Phoenix-- but definitely not one of the best I\'ve ever had.  Everyone else really loves the tomato bisque soup  but I don\'t because of the texture.  The bruschetta was definitely great  and the wine selection is good.  The only real negatives about the place are the following:\n\n1.  The servers didn\'t come around very often  and the pacing of the delivery of the appetizers to soup to entrees was a little long and a little off.  (We got our soup long after our entrees  which was a little odd.)\n2.  It\'s difficult to get a reservation  and when you do  sometimes you are not seated on time.\n3.  Prices are a little high.\n4.  The place is quite loud.\n\nAll in all  though  I would definitely eat here again  and every person I\'ve eaten with at Vintage 95 loves it.  Just wish they could feel a little more ""organized "" for lack of a better term.  There are little things that aren\'t perfect  but the food is pretty good!', 'Would have been a 1 star except the great ambiance  lively band and wait staff (which was a bit slow) but helpful & friendly. This was my 2nd visit with 4 or more business associates. Both times we ordered the charcuterie (V95 board) appetizer and both times that was awesome.  \n\nThis visit (2/28/15) I chose the flatiron steak as an entree.  It was the worst steak I can recall ever being served  I asked for med rare / med and it was a severely undercooked  sinewy excuse for a $30+ dollar piece of meat.  I wasn\'t sure whether to ask for the steak to be sent back or for a sharper steak knife to cut it! I won\'t send meals back though  I just don\'t return to the establishment - a plate at that price should be done right the first time.  \n\nTo top it off - all the next day I had very ""fluid"" reminders that I shouldn\'t have forced myself to eat 1/3 of that steak. \n\nThe wine and wine list were good & the duck the rest of my party had was as well. With tip the bill was  $200  which would have been fine had I been able to eat.  \n\nV95 as of yesterday does not off the flatiron (mis)steak on the menu  maybe they figured out its atrocious  I won\'t be back to confirm.', ""Had such great hopes for this establishment. We have been here four times pervious and it was great the food and serving portions were wonderful. Unfortunately on our return tonight they have redesigned their menu and portion sizes. We questioned the waitress on the serving sizes and she recommended that we bring it up with the Manager since she had  had the same response from several people recently. We have pictures of our food from the previous visits  because we are foodies and like to share pictures of the happy finds we are enjoying. The Manager tried in many ways to tell us it was the same size serving  even though the picture was way more bountiful on all of the previous visits. We finally gave up on trying to discuss it with him and went about our dining experience. Nothing was the same even the combinations on the bruchetta board was different. You can definitely tell that they have scaled everything back to save on cost and possibly even changed food distributors. We are very sad because we probably won't go back and we had been so excited to have a place like this so close to home. We hope they change and if they do please let us know."", 'I came here with my husband recently for my birthday. Chose this place based on Yelp reviews since we live an hour away and weren\'t familiar with the area. We decided to come at 5pm  in the middle of what I read was their happy hour. It was a Sunday and it certainly wasn\'t crowded. There were maybe 2 other tables when we were seated. \n\nIt\'s a nice place. A little smaller than I expected from pictures on Yelp  but that\'s not a bad thing. My husband and I both got drinks. He got a beer and I got ""Ginger is a Peach""  which was good. \n\nWe decided on the bruschetta board. Of the four we tried  our favorites were the tomato and the salmon. Our least favorite was the fig/pistachio one. It just tasted too much like a dessert. It was the only one neither of us volunteered to finish. \n\nMy husband ordered the New York steak and I ordered the duck. We both really enjoyed our entrees. I guess word that it was my birthday got out  because out came a dessert...it was like a s\'more in fudge form. I expected it to be warm  but the fudgey part was actually cool. Not sure if it was supposed to be or not. I\'d seen pictures of other desserts on Yelp even though there was no dessert menu that I saw and I would have likes to try something else  but the s\'more thing was pretty good. \n\nOverall  it was a good experience. Our server seemed a little over expectant...always looking at us like we were being too slow even though that wasn\'t the case  while at the same time stopping to chat with another table like old buddies. But it didn\'t bother us much. The prices are a bit high  I feel  but the food is good.', ""This place is amazing! Great staff  very friendly and knowledgeable. Don't be afraid of the fancy menu  I don't think you could go wrong with anything on there. Great cocktails  they can literally make anything. Even saw them roast a marshmallow for a cocktail  woah. Definitely coming back here."", 'Went there for dinner with a friend. We ordered bruschetta and my favorite was the pistachio one. Very yummy. The service was good. We ended up splitting an app and entrée and they split up the food for us which was nice. We ordered a burger medium well but it came out rare which was disappointing. The burger itself looked better than it tasted but the fries were good.  I could take or leave this place though  hence three stars.', ""I think it's awesome that Vintage 95 only serves beers from Arizona breweries - way to support the local team!  When I found this place on my Yelp app  I naturally assumed I'd be getting some wine but I couldn't resist trying the Epicenter from San Tan Brewery  holy mackerel - is this a delicious beer! \n\nTo eat - I had the Warm Brie with apricot  hummus  grilled flat bred.  It was an appetizer but it was the perfect size for a quick lunch time bite.

I like the rustic furniture and ocmfy chairs with live music  but their happy hour is what drew us here. Great priced cocktails and decent wines for $5.

A nice date night place  or spot to go enjoy some wine with your girlies.', ""Stopped by to check out this place and loved it.  Even though we visited a few months ago when it was very new  the service and food were excellent.  Wonderful outdoor area with lots of comfortable furniture.  I'll be back with more friends."", 'I have been to Vintage 95 probably 8-10 times now & normally it could be a 4 star place.  It\'s typically great for what it is  a local restaurant in the AZ suburbs  that don\'t always offer non-chain restaurant options.  We went to restaurant week last night & didn\'t care for it.  The restaurant was almost empty  but the service was super slow.  We were asked to take our silverware off the plates being cleared to use them again; which is fine  but also a weird request of the customers in any typical medium-high-end restaurant.  We were sitting outside & a kitten/it\'s ""patio cat"" mom were climbing all over the tables.  I mentioned that sadly  I\'m super allergic to cats so I didn\'t want my silverware on the table that we assume previously had cats walking on it.  We all balanced the used silverware on top of our water glasses.  Which throughout the evening someone was always sitting with an empty water glass for 5-10 minutes.  The menu was average & too large of portions for restaurant week  my mid rare steak came out wrong twice; first blue rare  then rare  but at least I could take it home & finish cooking it there correctly.  The cocktails were good  it was a lovely evening weather wise  and the staff was kind.  We will be back  I just don\'t suggest it for restaurant week or if you have kitty allergies.  Side note  the kitten was precious & we were told it needs a home.', 'You\'re experience here will vary greatly depending on what you order. Even though the atmosphere says ""drinks and tapas"" the bigger  heartier meals on the menu are where Vintage 95 really hits the spot. \n\nMy suggestion? Pork Belly\n\nNext Suggestion? Pork Belly!\n\nOut of pork belly? Bruscetta  but come back next time for the Pork Belly. \n\nPS - Kudos to whoever made the music playlist.', ""Decided to meet a friend afterwork and had a wonderful time here.

The management/owner is a class act!"", ""I booked an 8pm dinner reservation for a bachelorette party of 10 this Saturday. Our party showed up 20 minutes early thinking we could get a drink at the bar or maybe  just maybe they would have our table ready. Our table was not ready so they sat us outside so we could enjoy a drink while we waited for our table. However  a storm was brewing outside and it started to rain. So they moved us to the front patio (this would have been a comfortable place if they had a misting system)  it was a humid 111 degree day  so we were hit  thirsty and hungry by this point. Our server John came in to turn this unfortunate situation around  he got us drinks with assurance and a smile. We didn't sit at our table until 8:30 or so  but they provided customer service by giving us complimentary champagne. We were taken care of and satisfied."", ""Nice atmosphere but the food didn't quite measure up.  Great live music and Wednesday wine specials were good.  Rock shrimp was tasty but cold.  Flatbread was tough and toppings a bit bland.  Chocolate brownie good but apple crisp fell flat.  Will try another eatery next time in the area."", 'I\'ve been wanting to try this place for a while.  There is a sincere dearth of eclectic and inventive restaurants in the east valley in my humble (albeit) transplanted to AZ opinion and I\'ve admired the menu here for a while.  So happy I had a chance to enjoy it for lunch and was not at all let down.  Bruschetta was fresh  creamy  with wonderful variations on top perfect bread. My lovely friend got the special salmon pasta and I had the Havana (having just seen Chef  in the mood for a Cubano)  and everything was simply perfect.  Our waitress was great  manager checked in on us and as my friend and I had not seen each other for a while  sat for a 4 hour lunch and was never made to feel like we need to ""move it along.""  Even got iced teas to go (a personal favorite touch for me).  Now  onto the décor and ambience  a mixture of tables and comfy chairs and couches for wonderful conversation areas.  Don\'t be mislead by the ""wine bar""...which is most definitely it is..because it is a full menu restaurant.  I will most definitely come back for dinner and many more lunches.  Downtown Chandler is a nice little gem.', 'My new favorite place in the valley! The bruschetta was terrific - my favorite was the smoked salmon but the pistachio  date  mascarpone was delicious as well. All 3 of us loved our entrees - extremely creative and the flavored blended incredibly well. Great job chef!!', 'Meet some friends for happy hour a few weeks ago.  Great place for wine and appetizers.  Service was good and food was great.  Definitely recommend this one.', 'This place is cool  nice  interesting and godly over priced.  I loved the rock shrimp. Those were probably the only thing on the menu thats worth the money.  The wine selection isnt bad.  My bf got pretty friendly with the bar tender and thought for some reason that the bartender would have given him a deal.  But definitely not the case.  I dont mind paying for expensive nights out and such  I just dont feel this place was completely worth it. Just my opinion.', 'Had a very enjoyable time at Vintage95 last Saturday night. The wait staff was top notch and very accommodating. Very comfortable atmosphere and furnishings.

It doesn't get much better."", 'My husband & I came here for our 24th Anniversary. We had a great time. Great attentive service. Food was wonderful & just what we had hoped for.

We had the Moscato which is our favorite.', ""Oh Vintage 95  I am in love with you! \n\nThis place is fantastic.  From the modern decor to the eclectic menu options.  I can't say enough about this place.  Did I mention that I like this place?  I went here for a lunch while visiting downtown Chandler.  I have had V95 on my Bookmark for a while.  \n\nFirst  you walk into this establishment and it is a posh modern place of beauty.  This time (Early spring/Late winter) of the year is perfect for going to a place like V95 because they can open all the doors and extend the inside outward.  \n\nI enjoyed my bruschetta board very much.  My friend and I both had wonderful glasses of wine."", ""Three stars is for the flavor of the food. Unfortunately it wasn't well executed. So for execution I'd give it more like 2 stars.  The drinks took so long that the food had arrived before we got them.  But the food wasn't what we ordered unfortunately. The waiter was very nice and he fixed it as quickly as he could.  But even then the execution wasn't great. The turkey panini was flat grilled on dry bread so it crumbled as you picked it up.  The flavor of the bruschetta was good but again the execution made it hard to eat. The bread was sliced but the toppings were put on after.  Standard flatware isn't sharp enough to cut through prosciutto so I destroyed it trying to serve it to my table mates.  \n\nSo generally we were treated well and liked the food but the execution just wasn't really good enough to bring us back again."", ""So... all of my reviews for awhile are going to start with how pleasantly surprised I am by a quality independent restaurant here. I read such bad reviews about the food in the Phoenix area from foodies like myself who come from places famous for their independent food scene. Once again... HAPPY! Granted the meal I ordered was simple. Had the new york strip with green beans.But it was perfect! I ordered medium rare and it was truly medium rare. The steak was quality  the beans were cooked perfectly and spiced beautifully. The one negative was weird.. the plate was tiny. So small that I had to take half my steak off the plate and put it on a side plate to be able to cut it. The sauce was falling over the side and the tiny  avante garde plate had a bizarre swoop in it so i couldn't rest my knife on it without it sliding off. That should really be changed. But back to the good stuff. The bartenders were fabulous! Both recommended wines were perfect  they were friendly and funny and best of all... quick. This is going to become a regular haunt for sure."", 'This may be my new favorite place to eat in Chandler. If you are looking for a very good meal  this is the place to take that someone special.\n\nWe went on a Friday night around 8pm and sat on the back patio. I started with the cheese tray  had some fantastic cheeses I had never had before.\n\nThen I had a cup of the tomato soup. My biggest mistake  getting a cup and not a bowl. So rich and creamy. was fantastic.\n\nFor dinner I had the pork and my wife had the grouper. Both of us were very happy with our choices. \n\nIf there was one disappointment it was the chocolate tort we shared for desert. I would not order that again  but the rest of the meal was so fantastic that I almost forgot we even had desert. \n\nGreat service too. I could not be happier  will be back.', ""Good for drinks  apps  and atmosphere. \nNot good for corporate events  large parties  dinners\n\nI enjoy Vintage 95 on a regular basis but only for happy hour for a few drinks and some apps. There are good deals for wine and flatbreads. The atmosphere on the patio is quite lovely. Service is pretty good but it depends on your server. A few of the servers are pros  really know their stuff  and want to make your experience positive. Others are not as attentive and friendly. So it really depends. In my opinion  the ambiance  the cool firepit  live music  and good specials are worth it if you are planning to head over for some drinks after work. You will really enjoy yourself.\n\nPlanning an event for a large group is a completely different story and I highly discourage anyone from considering this. I worked with a one of the Vintage 95 managers to plan an event for about 14-15 people for several weeks. At first  I was very happy with their willingness to work with my budget  menu preferences  etc. As we got closer to the event  however  the responsiveness dropped but upon a few friendly nudges  eventually we got the menu  date  prices set. When I showed up with my large group  the event fell apart. The server didn't realize we had a prix-fixe menu  wasn't aware of any of the requests I had made in regards to drinks/ bottles of wine. It was as if I hadn't even made any preparations in advance. He seemed embarrassed and did whatever he could to make repairs. I was embarrassed to be hosting such a poorly run event but we all tried to stay light-hearted. First round of drinks and appetizers was pleasant. \n\nThen we waited over an hour for the main entrees to come  because  surprise  the chefs were probably unprepared. Food was mediocre at best and the efforts I had taken to have a light  family-style tapas type of meal (which the manager had actually suggested to me  not vice versa)  was completely ignored. Dinner was awkward. Food was not great. I was disappointed to say the least. I think all would have been made better if the manager would have come out  apologized for the inconvenience or misunderstanding and perhaps offered some desserts or an appetizer... something  anything to show they recognized they did not meet expectations. Aside from our server being great and doing his absolute best  the rest of the management staff didn't make much attempt to have us leave on a good note. Having worked in the food industry myself for many many years  this is just not cool.\n\nWhat is worse  I emailed the original manager  who I worked with to plan. Not a mean  what in the world happened  type of email.. just a casual note praising the service but pointing out the obvious misses. I didn't receive so much as an  acknowledgement. Again  not cool. \n\nSo here I am  compelled to give you the good and the bad. I think this place has excellent potential and has an awesome vibe for chilling. If you're looking for something more serious and prepared however  not the best place. \n\nI will continue to go to Vintage 95 for happy hours. \n\nMy other work events at Chop  The Mission  The Living Room  Kona Grill  and Firebirds have all been much better experiences. Try one of those if you're planning to go with a large group."", ""Very nice for a date out.  It's a little pricey but the food is excellent.  It's nice to get a really good steak these days.  The ambiance is really nice.  When I was able to drink wine... the options were varied and had a great time!"", ""The food was ok and very expensive I didn't think it was worth it. I think this place is more for drinks then the food. I prefer a couple of the other restaurants right around it  more"", ""I love the look and feel of this place. It's nice  elegant and cozy inside but not pretentious. The outdoor patio is perfect! They had a couple wines that are pretty rare and hard to find and compared to other restaurants  the mark up wasn't too bad.

The Pear is delish! I would have liked to see more options on the dinner menu  especially with the extensive wine list. But the dishes we did have went well."", 'The food was delicious  as was the cocktail. Happy hour had good options  and the ambiance was very enjoyable. I especially liked the lamb platter. The dessert was enjoyable but a little underwhelming.

Came back to give it a second shot  and was pleased."", 'Never again will I allow this place to ruin my dining experience. There are so many more places to spend my dining dollars. This year  for Valentines Day (actually on Sat the 13th)  I made reservations (in January) for dinner with my wife and when we arrive  they want to seat us at a ""table"" that is actually a trunk that sits lower that the actual seats that surround it  one of which is sofa type seat. When I ask for an actual table I am told that the only ""available"" seat would be outside. Mind you  I specifically requested an indoor table when I made my reservations. It was just about 6 PM  and although the rear patio was pretty full  inside the restaurant there were literally 10 to 12 empty tables  including two right next to the ""table"" we were directed to. When I pointed that out  one of their condescending staff members proceeded to remind me that it was Valentines Day  like I was some kind of moron who didnt realize that. They also told me that if I wanted a ""real table"" then I would just have to wait...wait for what? One of those empty tables to be available?  \nBasically I felt as though we were only good enough to be seated at a trunk  but not an actual table. Apparently they save those for someone who\'s reservation is more important. That silly trunk table was suitable for sitting down to have some drinks and maybe a few appetizers  not for a couple trying to enjoy a Valentines Day dinner.  Who wants to try to eat dinner off a trunk no higher that the seat you are sitting in (maybe 20 inches high....) and no way to even put your feet under it? \nAnyhow  this was my last visit to Vintage 95. This place needs stop trying to be the hippest spot in Chandler and start caring about their customers dining experience. From a previous visit ( I walked out this time) I can tell you that the food is actually pretty good  but they make is so difficult to enjoy it. Like I said above  Never Again.', ""I love the leather sofas  comfy chairs  the fireplace  brick walls and the general ambiance of this restaurant.  It's very warm and very conducive to just sitting in conversation while having a glass or two of wine.  I had the tomato bisque which was very good and the rock shrimp which was also good.  I sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly and knew his wines.

It\'s a brunch thing normally.""  It was currently 1:45pm. Brunch is served until 3pm on Sunday. Drink was the worst Bloody Mary I have ever had. I couldn\'t even finish it. \n\nAsked for a house salad but with romaine lettuce instead of mixed greens. Waiter asked if I wanted house dressing and I asked what it was. His answer  "" I don\'t really know what it is.""  I said a side of ranch is fine. Salad comes and it\'s mixed greens.

I tend to sit in the back patio where there is a cute little atmosphere.  A note though  for the owners  why aren't there little twinkly lights on the trees?  It would make it so much easier to see!  I'm a young person  but I even felt it was a bit too dark.  \n\nSo  the wine  can't go wrong.  There is a nice selection and somewhat affordable.  \n\nFood...\nThe warm brie is so devilish.  You can't really screw up warmed brie  and that's the problem.  I have to avoid it because I'll just eat all of it myself and it's not the healthiest.  lol\nThe house soup is also a favorite.  Grilled Cheese croutons.  That's the only reason to buy it.  \nThe bruschetta was bruschetta.  Large protions  but also average.  Nothing overly creative in regards to the toppings.  It wasn't bad  but I wouldn't go here for the bruschetta.  \n\nIt is a nice place to get a drink with friends in downtown chandler.  Quiet  which lends itself to conversation.  Wine and conversation ... that is why I go here."", ""My wife and I celebrated our 3rd anniversary at this fantastic place years ago.   We decided to come back for a great valentines dinner.  When we asked the server about the dishes we remembered so fondly  he said we have had several chefs since then and they change things to their tastes so we don't have those any more.  We should have just left.  I had the salmon and coconut rice.   The fish was nicely cooked and charred but had no flavor and the rice was underdone.  My wife had the beet salad but we found no beets  no feta  and she said it didn't taste good.  I guess the current chef is a fan of my 8th grade cafeteria cook and loves bland microwaved food out of a bulk box.   The highlight of our meal was the cute feral black cat that kept visiting our table on the patio.   Even he wouldn't eat the salmon.....what does that tell you?   The server rocked and the patio was really nice.   They comped our meal but the mgr didn't even bother to come out to speak to us or anyone the entire time we were there.  I think the numerous chefs may not be the issue as much as the mgmt.  such a shame that this place has devolved into what it is now.   Do not waste your time as this is not even a shadow of what it once was.   So disappointing."", ""This place is the best for happy hour! The restaurant itself is fairly dark  with heavy wood furniture and dim lighting  but the back patio more than makes up for it. Comfortable chairs and groupings with misters in the summer and heaters and fire pits in the winter  it's like hanging out in someone's posh backyard. While the food and drinks are on the pricey side  you won't find better appetizers or mixed cocktails anywhere in Downtown Chandler  the chefs and bartenders are masters at their craft!"", 'My wife and I have been here three times and have always left very pleased. Food is always fantastic  wine list isexcellent  and service has been good. Also great AZ draft beer selection.', 'Dined here this evening on a recommendation from a colleague.  Ordered wine  brochette  and an entree.  The bread used for the brochette is way to think  making it more of an entree than an appetizer.  The entree came to the table cold for a hot dish. Serve shared the entree is par baked and must have not been heated up thoroughly  Overall not a bad place  just the ""bar of expectation"" was set way to high.  Maybe another try some other time.', ""i like the relaxed atmosphere of this place. it's nice and dark for a dinner date and comfortable enough to grab just a glass of wine at the bar. \n\nfood here is about average. there was really nothing stand out that we had during our meal but everything was cooked well and served nice and hot. service is also good  with waiters/waitresses being friendly and attentive.bar staff is pretty nice however it gets a little crazy for them during the dinner rush and you could be left waiting for a drink for a while.\n\nthis place also has a lovely patio that is well equipped with heaters and a large fire pit. while i know it gets a little too cold in the winter to sit outside  this patio is perfect for fall and even summer nights. \n\nall in all a decent place in chandler for some relatively swank ambiance and a good wine selection."", ""Great wine bar  really nice atmosphere  and delicious hors d'oeuvres and entrees."", ""Went here for a friend's birthday dinner once and I really liked the food and the service was great too I went on a night that had live music and it was very enjoyable.

What a great location  especially at Christmastime with all the downtown holiday lights  and the inside of V95 is always warm and inviting. We started with a server who knew about the wine list  which was helpful in selecting ones that went well with our appetizers. We enjoyed a tasty flatbread - I would have liked it crisper but the tomato sauce and sausage were excellent (homemade sausage I think). The brie platter was good but not too exciting. Wish we would have tried a meat/cheese platter...next time. At any rate  super service and a lovely after -dinner hangout with live music!"", ""Had a great time here. Ambience is great. Staff even better. A little pricey on the Tuscan blend  $12 a glass  even though a whole bottle is like 20 bux. But I'll do it again.

I enjoyed the smoked tomato bisque  and this was the BEST tomato bisque I\'ve had in my whole life! I was about to lick the bottom of my bowl. Apparently  the tomatoes are smoked for a while  which gives the dish that ""smoked"" flavor.

Staring with the warm Brie  flavorful and perfectly warmed  soft but not runny; the pork belly with grits was luscious; the assorted meats were complemented wonderfully with dried cherries  pine nuts  olives and pistachios. \n\nThe smoked tomato bisque was deliciously smokey and smooth. I don\'t think that earlier reviewers had the same soup.  \n\nThe duck breast with cherry mojo was delicious. The duck was succulent and set off perfectly with the mojo  which was both tart and spicy. My wife had the braised ribs  that she said were the best beef she has ever had. My father in law had the portobello mushroom  which he raved about. My mother in law had the grouper  done perfectly moist and flavorful. Finally  my sister in law had the vintage burger  which was just as good as the other yelpers have said. \n\nAll of this was complemented by the Klinker Brick ""Old Ghost"" 2009 Zinfandel. \n\nEmily was our server  very attentive  but unobtrusive.

They sat us at the most awkward table in the whole place  which is this 2 person table located right by the front waiting area and way too close to another table where you have to worry about bumping into the person behind you so we asked to move. I ordered the Ahi Tuna and it tasted terrible to me..the tuna itself was good but everything else did not compliment it at all..I felt like it was just some random things added when you experiment with food but didn't come out as good as you thought it would. I just ate the tuna. I also had the banana tres leches and since I am Mexican I'm going to be terribly picky about this. They definitely had the right idea but the banana flavor tasted generic when it would've been better if it tasted more like real bananas. Other than the food this place had really good service and a nice atmosphere but if it wasn't for those two things Vintage 95 would have got 2 stars for overpriced not so great tasting food."", ""Great wine.  There was nothing overly bad about it  but i also didn't love it.  Expected a bit more for the prices.  I also will avoid the bruschetta in the future.  The bread was too thick and drowned out the flavor of the toppings.  I did really like the steak however  I will definitely get that if we go back again.  Seems like a good place for happy hour  however  for the price i think you can find a better spot for dinner."", 'Excellent wine bar with a great quiet atmosphere.

Great everything - menu and service. If you visit Old Town Chandler be sure to experience this wonderful establishment. You won't be disappointed!"", ""Very nice atmosphere with exceptional service.\n\nThe wait that evening was for thirty minutes where we had time to hang out in the middle of Christmas shopping.  The cozy patio outside was so inviting that we decided to eat at the al fresco bar instead.  I wish I could remember the name of our cute little bartender  she was so sweet!  While the wine list wasn't extensive  the varietals were wonderfully chosen.  Hubby went for the Malbec and I  a Rosé.  The bruschetta seemed like a good pairing for our wines.  It was disappointing when it finally came out.  I could honestly have made this  or better  at home.  Costco goat cheese atop what seems to be pancetta  but tasted like liverwurst  was my least favorite.  The rest are equally dreadful with the chewy day old supermarket french bread as a foundation for non exciting ingredients.  The tomato bisque saved the night.  It was light and tart  with just a hint of cream to warm your soul.  \n\nIt was more a 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 starts for being local and a potential for being great.

Cozy and comfy  but that\'s where it ends!\n\nI walked in for my first time with a friend  and the service from the minute I was ""kind of"" greeted  was uncomfortable!

Garlic fries were OK  but the eggs were phenomenal!\n\nWe then moved to a table and had the scallop appetizer.  Great presentation and excellent preparation.  Followed that w/ the Ahi with Kimchee  on rice cake with a hot pepper sauce!  Outstanding prep for the ahi  seared just so lightly.  The Kimchee had a dry heat type of seasoning which was unusual and excellent.  The hot pepper sauce went great with the Ahi.  Wife had the Bruschetta mix  which was equally good. \n\nWrapped it up with the coconut and banana Tres Leches.  Well made   and not overly sweet.  Couple these wins with the knowledge of Jason the Somelier and our waiter Axel  and Vintage 95 is a must do again!', ""Can't wait to come back to Vintage 95 for a date night!\n\nVery romantic atmosphere  lots of comfy furniture  and live music on weekends.\n\nSarah R. and I tried a glass of the Coto de Hayas from Spain. Believe it was the Tempranillo Cabernet? Memory a little hazy  this was our last stop after a night of drinks. \n\nWould totally order the bottle  though. \n\nTheir wine selection is pretty extensive  lots of $5/glass options  and I know within a certain timeframe  you get a charcuterie board if you purchase a bottle. \n\nFull bar for all those that aren't wine lovers. \n\nThrow this one in your back pocket for date night  guys!"", 'Amazing!! \nMy family was in town while attending some spring training games. A friend of ours suggested Vinatge 95 and we are thrilled to say we fell in love with the place. Outstanding decor invites you to your dinning table or casual dinning at one of their couches or fire-pits. The three of us sat at a table next to the wine room and we started off with a flatbread which was a great way to start off our meal. They have an extensive wine list and we all had a glass of what our personal preferences was that night. Axel was our server and not only was he attentive to our needs but he was extremely personable. We all dabbed in each others entrees and had nothing bad to say about any of them. Personal favorite was the burger  cooked to perfection! We closed the place down as we talked to the Sommelier and GM. Thanks to everyone at Vintage 95- we will be back again next year!', ""I recently held my friend's Bridal Shower here and it was amazing!  All the staff (management/servers) and Erica my Event Coordinator there were the best!

I would strongly recommend making a visit to Vintage 95!"", ""Went on Friday at 6 pm - just missed Happy Hour and the place was busy and didn't have a reservation but they were able to seat the two of us inside (one of the few cool AZ days). The Patio would have been fine if the temps were at the normal average.\nService was attentive and knowledgeable about the wine list. \nHad the BLT salad to start which was fresh and tasty with just the right balance of flavors. Went for the Vintage Burger next which  to me   is one of the best in the Phoenix area - who would have thought a grilled shortrib/angus chuck blend could be so moist and flavourful? Ended up with the Coconut Tres Leche dessert which was just sinful but absolutely right.\nA great selection of wines with some good value bottles. It shows a commitment and passion to bring some interesting wines to the area. I will certainly go back to sample some more."", ""I loved the atmosphere and wine selection. I'd go there for wine and appetizers but not dinner. Food was good but not great. We ordered NY Strips Ned rare.

We started off with some drinks as we had gone for happy hour and then decided to accompany them with an order of the garlic fries & the brie with jam and walnut toast. For the cost of the fries  we thought there was an ample amount  they were garlic-y but not too garlic-y  and the dijonaise that came with them was an absolutely perfect dipping sauce. I'd definitely get them again. We felt similarly about the brie & toast  it was a perfect sized amount to go with some drinks.\n\nWe had a little snafu with our meal order but the staff / management was so gracious  we really appreciated it. I had a chance to look at their lunch menu and saw quite a few tempting sections ... We'll definitely be back!"", 'My wife and I have been to Vintage 95 twice in the past for dinner and had a decent experience (3 stars). But this last time we went  it was not very good. The food was decent  we ordered the meat and cheese boards and a couple of drinks. For the most part the quality of food meet our expectations. I am only giving Vintage 95 2 stars due to its service. When you eat at a restaurant with this price point and atmosphere you have certain expectations which were not met. Our waiter from what we could tell was either new or inexperienced. He did not have a good understanding of the menu and took 15 min to visit the table after we were seated. He was also setting up for a table of 6 that had reservations next to us. At the end of our dinner we could see that he was waiting on most of the tables in the restaurant. We counted a total of about 8 waiting staff including the bartenders and a manager. We could see out server was overloaded with tables  so we didn\'t give him a hard time or say anything. Unfortunately the table of 6 that had been seated next to us didn\'t feel the same. They told the server they were unhappy with the service and ""didn\'t want to be forgotten"". What really stands out in all of this this is the manager  who spent his whole evening talking to the staff. The staff was well dressed  mostly in black wearing ties  but the manager had his shirt unbuttoned (chest hair) and looked like he came off a night on the town. We did not see him address any of the tables  welcome guests and making sure their needs were met. This is where Vintage 95 failed  you have a waiter that is struggling and a manager that is more concerned with socializing then helping. We will not be going back to this establishment  there are too many other better options in downtown chandler.', 'We went during their Sunday Funday specials  and it was great! We got a cheap bottle of sparkling wine and enjoyed the adorable atmosphere. We also ordered the warm brie  which came with apricot jam  hummus  grilled veggies and pita - yum! \nThis is a cute gem in Chandler and definitely worth a visit!', 'I have never tasted food the way Vintage 95 makes it. My boyfriend and I come at least once every other month  for the price reason. We know the price is worth it. Every bite is worth the price of this food. Best restaurant for Downtown Chandler by far. Take it from me and order the scallops off appetizers. You will not regret it. Promise.', 'Visited Vintage for dinner on a Friday night for the first time... Beautiful decor! Absolutely loved the atmosphere! The bruschetta was decent although Ive had better. The bacon one was just horrid but others have liked it so maybe its just me : )The tomato bisque was AWESOME! Prime rib - not bad but not fantastic either  definitely overpriced. The very best part of the entire experience was our server  Richard. He was seriously amazing. He is the only reason they are getting 4 stars  should be a weak 3... I can make just OK food at home for less than $150. I will definitely try it again because I really loved the place and  want to make this work!', 'A few stops in here so far and we\'re well on our way to becoming regulars. Vintage 95 in the Old Town Chandler area  replaces what was an embarrassingly bad short lived asian restaurant. The location is gorgeous  great back patio  a small front one too if you want to do some people watching  or just want to watch the turnover of restaurants in the strip  which happens so often that yes  you may actually be able to see them close and open within the span of your meal / bottle of wine. The service has always been friendly here  and though we usually come during ""off"" hours  it always seems fairly quiet for lunch. The food menu is not incredibly diverse and sort of falls into wine bar modus operendi  i.e. assorted bruschetta  sandwiches  etc  but for the most part is well appointed and tasty. One star taken away because the food hasn\'t always been mind blowing. So pick and choose carefully  and you should be fine...lets just say that if the item isn\'t normally in your wheelhouse  don\'t order it. If its the kind of thing you\'d usually be ordering anyways  the familiarity will get you by. (The Green Chile Pulled Pork is quite tasty...but those words in that combination is going to get me every time) The wine list is great  the specialty cocktails are fun  the ambiance is a succesful combination of warmth and cool  and the service staff always pretty like-able. The business is still pretty young  but Chandler  we really need to be helping the good ones out. This is a good one  they\'ve got a good thing going here. so lets keep them around.', ""Whoa!\n \nSo I was impressed by the last time I was here and thought it was great. \n\nHere's a tip.

The crowd is lively with a good mix of people from twenty something and older singles out to eat and drink along with couples through their 70s to go with business people out for lunch  dinner or just drinks after work. The good music and unique decor are nice touches as it seems the owners have worked hard to build a fun yet classy atmosphere.\n\nThe menu is excellent (lunch and dinner) with strong wine and beer selections (including many local ones). The meat and cheese board and the various bruschetta selections are excellent for starters.  The flatbread selections are also very good. \n\nThe entrees are excellent with a variety of tasty selections but I favor the simple ones -- the chicken pannini and cheeseburger. That cheeseburger is ridiculously good. \n\nThe service has been good each time but getting better as the staff seems to be settling in. The owners stopped by the table on our latest visit and seem to be taking a great interest in their establishment. Well done -- we will be back again soon.', ""We were both really excited to try this place  and were thrilled when we saw that there was a groupon available.  We went on a Friday night- it was easy to make reservations that morning  and they called to confirm later in the day. \nThe couch/chair seating we were given was a little weird  would have been great if we were just doing wine  but the table was small and we had to hunch over to eat dinner. \nThe live music was great  not too loud at all. \n\nWe both started with a tomato bisque with grilled cheese croutons. ( The salads they offered were weird and had way too much crap on them.)  The bisque was really rich and cheesy  neither of us could finish it- but it was good. There were 3 grilled cheese croutons in the soup- but they were super soggy mushy blobs since they were put in rather than on the side. \n\nIt only went downhill from there. We ordered the veggie flatbread for our starter.  It tasted like a cheap supreme pizza. It had red peppers  artichokes and mushrooms on it. It was an extremely thin bread/crust. Cracker thin  but soggy so it was hard to eat the pieces fell apart when you would pick them up and all the toppings fell off. It was also burnt  and the sauce they put on it tasted like they warmed up a can of tomato paste on the stove with sugar and oregano. It was awful. \n\nFor the entrees I had the salmon- The server said it would be served medium- It was extremely burned- the edges and bottom were black and gross. There were only a few edible bites in the center- but they had to by picked at as to not get the charred bottom in the bite. The salmon had a mild flavor  but no detectable seasonings.  It was served on coconut rice- it was not good. The rice was kind of sweet and mushy  I like the almonds in it for texture- but only had 3 bites- one on its own  one with the salmon  and one with the salmon and mushroom salsa. \nThe Mushroom salsa was no edible- it was pungent  very sour and vinegary. \n\nMy Boyfriend had the Vintage burger- it was a short rib and chuck (? I think) Burger. He usually has a huge appetite- but he did not like it at all  he said it was burned and very dry and he had to choke it down. It was served with mixed fries ( half regular and half sweet potato) He ate some of them but was not a huge fan. ( He left 3/4 of the fries and 1/3 of the burger.)\n\nAnother server came to take our plate- mine was taken really early on and there was very very little eaten from it- she asked if I was finished as she was taking the plate- and walked off with it after I said yes  but before I could say anything else or ask for a replacement-  \n\nThey had paired the entrees with wine- Salmon came with a Pinot noir  and the burger came with a nebbiolo. Both tasted watered down and thin-but were drinkable. The Pinot was really really sweet- and he Nebbiolo had a really rich nose- but was very flat on the tongue.  \n\nThe server we had was really friendly  but seemed like he was busy. We didn't like that it seemed like they were all in a rush- and was more of a team effort for getting us our food/drinks/bussing the table.\n\nOverall  we absolutely would not recommend this place to anyone- unless you are going to go for the live entertainment and water- or maybe a mixed drink- we didn't try those so they could be fine as well. \nIt was really over priced even with the groupon  and the food was just not up to par by any means. Very disappointing."", 'Vintage 95 is very well decorated wine bar  with one of the most beautiful wine cellar I have ever seen. They have an enormous wine list  ranging from $40 to $3000 the bottle.

Last time we went there  we tried the Rose that is on their ""Wine by the Glass"" list; it was very nice.\nTheir bruschettas are quite good however they could get better bread  I feel like the bread could be grilled a little bit.

We ordered dinner 40 min passed not one waiter checked to see if we would like more drinks or anything. I flagged down our waiter and he said ""Oh let me check"". he apologized and returned to see if we wanted more drinks  we ordered drinks. The food came another 15 min. later but not the drinks. I ordered the tofu dinner which my noodles were extremely hard and the tofu was ice cold. The lamb wasn\'t well done but burnt. I explain this to our waiter and he apologizes saying he spoke with a manager and they would comp us for the dinner. My guest and I went to speak to the manager. I told him I would pass on the comp but dinner was really bad it like they just threw some food together without taking serving temperature to consideration.

However I would not recommend this place anyone due to the service alone.', ""Wow!  Really loved this place!  The food  service  atmosphere were all fantastic.

They told us that even though there were tables that were opened inside the restaurant when we arrived  they were all booked up and offered us to sit in the patio area. We were  getting ready to turn around and they offered us a couch with a huge tables that were shared with two other parties. The waiter was very attentive and certainly knows his menu very well. He offered us many great suggestions and we did end up ordering what he suggested. I ordered a duck and my friend ordered a plate with different variety of meats  cheese and bruschetta. The duck is very tender and juicy. The portion is perfect for one person. I also love the dishes that my friend ordered since I enjoy small bite dishes. \n\nOther than not feeling very happy to share a huge table with some loud mouth customers (not the restaurant's fault)  we had a enjoyable meal. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is because we saw 2-3 empty tables on our way out...and these tables were empty when we first walked in. Oh well....another time. I am happy that the hostesses still tried to find a spot for us to sit inside the restaurant."", ""Great happy hour prices!

Somewhat inappropriate  in my opinion."", ""I've been to Vintage multiple times for happy hour drinks only and it's been great. They do a nice mimosa pitcher as well. Due to the good drinking experience I've had there  I decided to take all of my friends to Vintage for dinner on Christmas Eve. There were 11 of us that evening. It was awful.. So awful that my friends said that I'm no longer allowed to choose where we go for dinner! The server was extremely slow.. which may have played a part as to why our steaks were completely cold. I could have dealt with a just warm steak  but cold? Not a chance! The food didn't even look good.. The plate presentation was as if the food was just thrown together and out it went. So bummed. I was hoping that this would be our new go-to for a great dining experience. Luckily I had plenty of appetizers waiting at the house after wards  because everyone was hungry."", ""Nice place if you have time for a long and leisurely lunch. I have walked by this place many times  never thinking it would be good but I'm glad I have it a try today. Yummy tomato soup - tasted smoky - the burger was delicious but I needed a nap after eating it (it's big enough to share and still leave stuffed as a turkey on Thanksgiving)."", 'Bruschetta was amazing. Ambiance was perfect for a valntines day date. Service was great.', 'My husband and I have tried to get a table at this restaurant but reservations are almost always needed if you want to sit inside so it took some preplanning to get a dinner reservation but we were glad we finally did as it had a really great ambiance and great food.  The only suggestion I have is that their live music is turned up louder so you can actually hear it.   The live music was the primary reason why we wanted to sit inside as it creates a nice atmosphere but the restaurant is already a bit loud and they had the musicians mic down to the point where it only felt like it was background instead of feeling like it was a focal point to enjoy.   I did really like the outdoor patio with fire pits and think next time we will sit out there and just enjoy wine and small plates as the dinner prices are a bit high.', 'Food is good  service is good  wine is meh  atmosphere is WAY too loud with the live band playing in such a tiny place.', 'Wednesdays from 4PM - Close they have $20 bottles of wine. I highly recommend both the vintage burger and the duck breast!', ""So disappointed. Have been for wonderful dinners in the past so thought we'd try brunch. Frittata was watery  toast cold  served with no butter or preserves  fruit must have been leftover from the night before  brats dry as a bone. Potatoes overdone. Only redeeming quality was the iced coffee  but even that was served with heavy whipping cream that separated. Service excellent and they did comp one of our meals. Not sure if there's a different chef for brunch but they need to go back to culinary school:("", 'Vintage 95 has defined itself as a standout. There are many wine bars out there  but this place feels more warm and inviting than most. With a comfortable and relaxed vibe (and lovely live music). The staff go out of their way to make you feel at home. The wine selection is unique and personal (by-the-glass options frequently change) with a wide spread on price points. The food is beyond high-caliber with excellent plating and great seasonal rotations of a variety of proteins and greens. The menu is diverse enough to please any mood. Mike Wahlberg  the master chef behind the fun din  is a culinary gem. Kudos.', 'Great time at Vintage 95 Saturday night!  Started out with happy hour wines  deviled eggs and garlic fries. Garlic fries were OK  but the eggs were phenomenal!\n\nWe then moved to a table and had the scallop appetizer.  Great presentation and excellent preparation.  Followed that w/ the Ahi with Kimchee  on rice cake with a hot pepper sauce!  Outstanding prep for the ahi  seared just so lightly.  The Kimchee had a dry heat type of seasoning which was unusual and excellent.  The hot pepper sauce went great with the Ahi.  Wife had the Bruschetta mix  which was equally good. \n\nWrapped it up with the coconut and banana Tres Leches.  Well made   and not overly sweet.  Couple these wins with the knowledge of Jason the Somelier and our waiter Axel  and Vintage 95 is a must do again!', 'Wow...I really liked this place!  The decor was great - very relaxing and cozy.  The service was efficient and friendly.  Everything is great about this place!', ""My wife and I do a weekly date night and after reading the reviews decided to give vintage 95 a shot. We arrived and really liked the ambiance and decor. We each started with a glass of wine which we really enjoyed- from there they gained no more stares...\n\nI'm not a food snob and I'm not very picky. I do expect for the price to reflect the quality of food and service. Unfortunately it didn't. The servers were not rude  but the were complacent and disengaged. The best food we had was our french fries.\n\nI ordered the daily special which was a soft crab sandwich and my wife ordered the Ahi Tuna. After one bite of the Tuna we had to send it back. Again  we aren't very picky people but the Tuna was 25 dollars and it tasted so fishy  it was so strong that the noodles it was rested upon smelled and tasted fishy. Meanwhile I struggled my way through the soft crab sandwich  but I now wish I didn't as it is not sitting well. My wife ordered a burger to replace the Ahi  but it came out bland and with ingredients that weren't fresh. $14 is a lot for a burger and there are places in the valley that I think it is worth it - Deluxe burgers and Lush burgers being good examples...this burger was not worth it.\n\nAll in all my guess is that this is a great place to have a drink and get some cheese or bruscetta- but beyond that it goes downhill fast. If you want the ambiance with a similar lounge feel but a much better quality of food go to Postinos."", 'This place was absolutely amazing. I was there alone on a sunday afternoon and I was treated like royalty. I orderd the Green Chile pulled pork sandwich and it was the best sandwich I have ever had. \n-The egg bun was the best part. \nMy server Lexi was knowledgeable and fun  she even reccomended a great cocktail that was thouroughly enjoyed.', ""I came here for a girls night last Thursday with a few friends. We had some wine and food out on the back patio. Unfortunately we arrived too late for Happy Hour.  The $5 a glass is a great deal even though the choices are limited. The even better deal is the free bruschetta board if you order a bottle; we definitely would have taken advantage of that if we had been there an hour earlier.  We were lucky enough to get to listen to the wonderful music of Sarah Vanell who was performing there that evening.  I thought I recognized her voice from Vincitorio's and so I googled it when I got home and sure enough it's the same girl.  She sort of sounds like Jewel but she sings a wide range of songs and puts her own stamp on the covers.  Just an awesome performer.\n\nThe bruschetta choices on the menu are pretty much the exact same descriptions as the offerings at Postino but after sampling them I can say that they are not quite the same caliber. The warm brie was good but not as impressive as I thought it would be.  I agree with April Q. that they are pretty skimpy with the bread which is surprising since it is just plain pita and didn't even taste like it was baked there. We also got a veggie flatbread which was a favorite of the girls who had been there before.  That was pretty tasty and I highly recommend it.  The dinner menu was short but there were a few entrees on there that I would like to try in the future.\n\nThe other girls shared a couple of bottles of Pinot Grigio that were very reasonable priced.  I  the lone red drinker  had a couple glasses of a really nice GSM blend that I can't remember the name of (their wine list on the website must not be up to date since I don't see it there either).  Our server was absent for a while in the beginning but made it up by being very friendly and attentive the rest of the time we were there.  The main attraction of this place is their patio.  It was really nice sitting out there by the fire pit.  There are trees and lights  and you can choose to either sit at a table and chairs or comfy couches.  I love the fact that you can see the City Hall building  too; it looks so cool at night.  The only thing that took away from the pleasant  relaxing atmosphere was the fact that there were a lot of smokers out there.  I had to take away a star for that."", 'Are you kidding me!!  This was the worst place ever!  Service was terrible... had to ask and wait forever for water ..the tomatoe bisque tasted like eating a salt shaker...ordered the sea bass it was so fishy and salty I could hardly eat it. The barley was undercooked to the point it was crunchy.   The wine glass was greasy and had fingerprints in it..   the only positive thing was the atmosphere   so disappointed that it was such a horrible experience.   Went here to try something new during restaurant week.   I will NEVER come back!!!!!!!', 'I still like this place... this being the 5th time I\'ve come here.  I wrote this update as this was the first time I actually tried something that wasn\'t the Vintage Burger or the Charcuterie Board and wanted to share my opinions:\n\n- Warm Brie: ok portion of cheese  though hummus was meager and I think the ""grilled vegetables"" could\'ve been more grilled and grilled-looking (as in grill marks  they looked bare and tasted bare).\n- House Soup: meh  not a fan.  It was pretty plain and served with very little croutons... not memorable nor something I\'d order again\n- Fall Salad: I was really surprised at how sweet this salad was.  It was spring mix with 3 or 4 little pieces of butternut squash (needs more!) and the maple vinaigrette was completely sweet (duh  it\'s maple based).. as in they poured maple syrup on the salad and mixed it like that in a bowl.  It was not pleasant because it was just so over the top sweet.  I would not order this again.\n\nOur companions loved their vintage burger  but agreed the soup was plain and not worth ordering.\n\nOur server gal was nice and quick and the atmosphere was  again  great.\n\nAnother issue: sitting in the front patio means you sit on these small \'patio\' tables that don\'t allow you to seat comfortably and eat... just an FYI.\n\nAlso  when we ordered the Charcuterie Board  they served us 3 slices of bread  so I asked for ""1 more slice"" since there was 4 of us.. she brought 4 more out and charged us for it.. I thought that was kinda crappy - there were 4 of us and we got 3 breads and when I ask for 1 more  I get 4 more and then get charged.  Not cool. \n\nI\'m going to have to try some other dishes to figure out if the burger and charcuterie board (and wine and atmosphere) are the only thing worth coming for.  I had a hard time bringing it down to 3 stars only because I really want to like this local place.', ""The ambiance was pleasant  the staff were nice. However the food weren't really great. Actually the entrees weren't  the warm brie was pretty tasty. \nMy husband ordered the sirloin  medium. It came out rare  the manager offered a new one (medium well this time)  came out well done. 4 stars are for the brie platter and how nice the staff were."", 'I\'ve been here enough times to know two things: the food is good and the service is borderline terrible.  \n\nI was here most recently with my boyfriend for a late lunch (3pm).  The problem?  Nobody ever came to offer us anything to eat.  The ""server""  who was clearly checked out and just waiting until 4pm until he could really ""check out""  gave us our order of drinks and then never  ever  ever returned.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I are both in the service industry  we both understand there is a ""down time"" (from 2:30ish till 4:00ish) where it\'s quiet and the kitchen is switching to dinner service and there aren\'t many (if any) customers in the place.  That\'s all the MORE reason to pay extra attention to the people that ARE in your place.  In this case  it was just us.  Our server came  told us there were no apps available because the kitchen was changing over (no problem)  took our drink orders  and then just ceased to exist until he could check out at 4.  Leaving us  two VERY hungry people  waiting at a table for an hour.  Honestly  it\'s this kind of experience that will turn someone off a place forever and that\'s while we will never go back to Vintage 95  despite what we know to be a good menu.  \n\nGo only if you\'ve got loads of time to waste and when you\'re barely starting to get hungry.  If you go when you\'re hungry  it\'s already too late.', 'Over served a belligerent customer at the bar who fell over in his bar stool hitting our table and spilling wine all over us.  Manager told us the patron was ""done"" instead he got the guy another drink.  Meanwhile our bottle of wine was wasted and shirt was ruined.   Service of the year award...', ""Let's start with the positives- service was excellent! Our server  Maxwell  was great.\n\nNegatives-mediocre food priced extremely high. The bruschetta board is $14 for 4 different choices. \nThe pistachio date bruschetta was way too sweet with nothing to balance out the flavors. There was a hint of cheese spread across the toasted bread which was so slight that it couldn't be detected. The bruschetta with the tomatoes and basil oil was supposed to come with house made ricotta. Again  the amount of ricotta on the bread didn't amount to anything. If it's so special  then give it to me and let me taste it!\nThe salami and olive bruschetta combined two salty foods  thus making it extra salty! Did not seem well thought out.\nTomato bisque was ok  but there were only 6 tiny croutons that when combined could have fit into a tablespoon. The menu description sounded like you might get some sort of grilled cheese croutons. Not even close.\nWe also tried the kale salad with salmon which was good  however the portion size could have been bigger considering the price.\nAgain  way over priced. I would not recommend this place unless you like throwing your money away."", 'Service is excellent. Food is good. Presentation could be more elegant  however  for price point and some gorgeous sunsets this spot is a gem. \n\nCome with friends  come with significant other  whom every enjoy!', ""I can't even begin to tell you how overpriced the wine is here. Last night we had a bottle Chappellet wine with our meal at an upscale Scottsdale restaurant. We paid 65 for it. Tonight we ate in downtown Chandler and they wanted 130 for the same exact bottle. My husband and I have had many red wines while visiting places from Baltimore to California. Never have I seen a more overpriced bottle of wine. This place needs to get over itself! Where do you think you are New York?"", 'I loved it here. I went here on a  date and the atmosphere was perfect and romantic. We had some bruschetta and I also ordered a salad.

I think we were there for 4 hours at least.\nOur server  John  was extremely attentive and knowledgable about the entire menu.\nMy best advice would be to go during less busy times  like Sunday afternoons or weekdays. The happy hours just can't be beat.\n\nThe Artisan plate was one of my favorites. You get to pick and choose from all sorts of meats and cheeses  that the waiter customizes for you.           \nA good tip with this is to ask for hummus on the side. It makes an excellent combination with the lavash flatbread  and the various cheeses and salamis (and blackberry preserves!!). You get sweet  salty  spicy and the whole spectrum of tastes  just by trying different combinations. every bite is different and delicious in its own way.\n\nThe BLT salad and watermelon salad are both not to be missed..and it was great to have a waiter (John) who was sensitive to our tastes and was honest about whether he thought the dishes we selected were going to be a good fit for us or not. \n\nI can't recommend this place highly enough (I rarely give 5 stars)  and will be back over and over again."", ""This is the 2nd time we come here and we are already huge fans!  The first time  the service was impressive - the bartender tended to us at our table an was not only really friendly and genuine  but knowledgeable and very helpful in wine and food pairing (we ordered the meat plate and it did not disappoint).  The 2nd time was an equally pleasing experience.  Our party of 7 got seated within a few minutes of arriving and our server gal was friendly  nice  and quick.  We went through several bottles of wine and the service was never slow or lacking (btw - they have an excellent Kim Crawford SB in the bottle section - recommend!).  A few of us had the vintage burgers and though I wasn't a big fan of the thick buns  i put them aside and found the meat and rest of the toppings very tasty and highly filling.  The ambiance was perfect - they had live music (a beautiful and talented gal on her guitar) and she chose perfect songs for the venue and the fireplace was going.  The owner stopped by to say hello and everything was all good.  We are fans and will return again!"", 'If you are near DT Chandler  stop in for a fabulous cocktail or some healthy eats!

They have a cool patio and inside a few comfy couches by a fireplace.  They give you a free cheese or meat board with a bottle of wine so i rarely need to order any food.  Prices are good and so is service.  Great place for a romantic evening or a few wine-o friends.  I have not had much food there but the free (with bottle order) cheese plates and charcuterie boards are more than enough for me to eat.  If you are not a wine person they also have some real nice beers on the menu including one of my favorites  Four Peaks 8th Street Ale.  Good to see them support their local breweries.', 'Hmmm.....this is my second visit to Vintage 95 and I was not impressed  in fact  I was a bit shocked at the going\'s on.  Don\'t get me wrong  I love the atmosphere in this place  but there has to be more than that.  I\'ll start by saying that my friends and I were watching a soft-core porn film right behind us.  Boots being unzipped  straddling and lots of tongue were all part of this low budget film.  It was disturbing to be so close to this display by two drunk people (and being unattractive didn\'t help either).  We brought this up to our waitress who said...""you should see what goes on on the patio"".  If it\'s that shocking to the staff  how do you think the patrons feel?  It\'s not appropriate and it should be put to an end.  The Bacardi tastes like rock gut...I\'ve been drinking Bacardi for a long time and sent back a few drinks on this evening asking the waitress if she was sure he was pouring Bacardi.  She confirmed he was and said that was probably as good as it was going to get - I don\'t know what\'s in that Bacardi bottle  but it isn\'t Bacardi  that\'s all I know.  My friend had an issue with her Tanqueray & Tonic too  so mixed drinks aren\'t the way to go here.  Another friend was disappointed in the selection of Zinfandel\'s.  The food was definitely better the first time we were there  which was right after they opened.  We ordered the Bruschetta and the bread was a bit soggy and there was way too much cheese on each of the 4 different varieties we tried.  I would probably go back  but I wouldn\'t have mixed drinks and hopefully they can take it down to an ""R"" rating.  The bright spot was the incredibly gorgeous guy that was at the table next to ours with his  uh  wife....who knows what she was because he kept taking his wedding ring on and off.  Oh  lots of fun people watching.', ""Wow!  I can't believe I'm giving 5 stars to a place in Chandler  Arizona!

We ordered the salmon and they brought it out on 2 plates  the presentation was nice  the salmon was encircled with grits and a green sauce and there were some julienned grilled veggies on top of the salmon but for $22  we basically got a ""taste""   the entire 2 pieces of salmon couldn\'t have weighed more than 3 oz and the little bit of grits and veggies could not be considered ""sides"".  The salmon was tasty  I just wish there had been more of it.  I guess we paid for the nice atmosphere.  I would go back but probably just for wine and apps.', ""I really don't understand the positive reviews. Based on these reviews and a perusal of the menu I booked a table for 6 on a Thursday evening. When we arrived half our party was late but they were kind enough to seat us anyway (that's why this is a two star review). We decided to order some starters while we waited. We were seated minutes after happy hour ended. Other tables had delicious looking fries and the waiter agreed to let us order them despite happy hour having expired. How bad can a fry be before you stop eating it? Very bad. They were limp  greasy and chewy. The warm Brie was a room temperature gelatinous mess. The food was so bad we left  met the rest of our party outside  and ate elsewhere. There is a lot of competition on Boston Street and this place can't keep up."", ""For a glass of wine and some appetizers in a pleasing atmosphere complete with a fireplace inside  firepits outside  live music some nights and great service... well  you can't beat Vintage 95 in good ol' downtown Chandler. What to wear? Anything your heart desires. While jeans and flip flops on the patio would be fine  you can definitely show up in a sexy dress and heels and not feel out of place in their dining room. \n\nA few tips:\n+ For seating: Romantic  dark and seductive indoor setting. Casual  fun and relaxing outdoor patio.\n+ Live music: Thursday nights are my favorite with Sarah singing and playing guitar inside. She can play anything from Bob Marley to Adele to The Beatles to Rihanna. Her voice is soothing and sweet. Love her! Don't forget to bring tip money! If you do forget  the closest ATM is a few doors down at that crazy Bourbon Jack's.\n+ Sunday brunch: Must try! Delish! All that needs to be said."", 'Decent food  nice atmosphere   attentive service.   I liked it   but didn\'t love it enough to gush about it.  It\'s good  and the food was nice.   I can\'t put my finger on why I just liked it instead of loved it.   It reminds me of Postino\'s  but I enjoy Postino\'s more.   Nothing grabbed me to make myself say  ""I can\'t wait to come back and have ... again!""\n\nHowever  it was good. Like when a date is generally good   and you get asked   ""how was your date?"" And your reply is  ""She was nice.""', ""My wife and I both loved this place! The appetizer  beer  and burger was outstanding  and the service was very good.  We were seated in a cramped table next to where people were waiting for a table  but we enjoyed the food so much that we didn't care. This is a great downtown Chandler restaurant!"", ""This place used to be awesome! Check out the Brickhouse next door.  Much better drinks and food. By the way...they don't sell smores for dessert any more."", 'It was our first time here. We joined another couple for dinner.  I ordered the shrimp and grits  my husband had the NY strip. Everything from the wine and meat board with olives through to the end of the main course was beyond fabulous! We will definitely be back! Great service too.', ""My buddy and I were looking for a late night option last night (around 9:30)  and stumbled across this place thanks to my handy dandy Yelp app.  We were seated outside  which was lovely  and we got the bruschetta (the one with pancetta and mushrooms was ridic).  Then we got some of their tomato bisque soup  and the Italian flatbread.  I wasn't crazy about the tuna or the salmon options on the bruschetta  but almost everything else was spot on.  Yes  we dunked the flatbread in the soup - and it was ideal.\n\nGreat service  great ambiance  and right across the street from Paleta's Betty - which  consequently  has the best popsicle EVER (the orange creamsicle).  All in all  it was a great night and I look forward to going back and trying their entrees!"", 'I was so excited that downtown Chandler finally had a wine lounge and had high expectations of this establishment based on what I had heard.\n\nThe new owners have completely transformed this former restaurant into a very comfortable and inviting wine lounge.  There is just the right mixture of tables  bar seating and comfy chairs and couches arranged into nice seating areas.  The fireplace adds a nice touch .. and that\'s just the inside. The outdoor patio is just as nice and with the heaters you can enjoy it year round.\n\nI\'ve only tried the cheese boards here  the selection of cheese is very good (you get to pick 3 out of about 9) and the presentation is nice.  The only thing that is holding me back from a better rating is the red wine selection.  Since I don\'t drink white I can\'t comment on the whites.   I\'ve also found the servers\' knoweldge about the wine really varies.  Fortunately they will give you a taste if you ask for it.  \n\nI will continue to come here especially if I want a chill evening with great live music with Sarah but this isn\'t your ""go to"" place to try new and interesting wine or learn more about wines.', ""We went to Vintage after dinner one night for drinks and dessert  with some friends. It was very cozy and had a nice live 2 man band  I got the tres Leche cake and it was pretty amazing. Service was good and good and drinks were good. I'd have to go back to the the food and review again later."", ""We went here to celebrate Valentine's Day and what a great choice! We were seated outside in comfy chairs with a fire pit in front of us for for ambiance.  \n\nWe had some wine and bruschetta followed by a phenomenal dinner.  We ordered the sea bass and a burger and took turns eating them both. My wife who doesn't even like fish really enjoyed my sea bass. It was delicious! Her burger was amazing too!  Made from Grilled Shortrib and Angus Chuck Patty with Tenderbelly Bacon  Lettuce  Tomato  Crispy Onion Straws and Cheddar Cheese.  Yum!!\n\nOur server was attentive without being in the way and allowed us to relax and enjoy our evening  never making us feel rushed or neglected."", 'Great spot that I highly recommend. Good wine selection and food  excellent ambiance that is perfect for a date night and plenty of options around to check out.', ""Brie was boring. Everything white/yellow and mushy. Grain salad was good but needs better presentation. I was only customer at the bar and GM was here talking to/training his staff and all ignored me. GM was arrogant. Had employee make him a stiff drink at 4 pm while he talked about his workouts (not in good shape).  Won't come back. Weird vibe."", ""I've been here twice  once a few weeks ago for a surprise brunch and yesterday for my friends birthday. The food is really amazing we ordered the bruschetta (the bacon jam and the salmon with salsa verde are full of flavor) pork belly  and the shrimp appetizers were tasty as well. For the main entrees we had the ahi  duck breast and the flatiron steak. Everything tastes so good  and cooking duck breast is very hard. So it was a pleasant surprise to have it done properly not too greasy or too dry and it had a good spice and flavor from the blackberry sauce. Our server was very friendly  knowledgeable  and guided us through the menu and the wine list. As for breakfast they have great fluffy pancakes that you must try! Also the egg in the hole with a fontina cheese sauce is perfect for brunch. Skip Postinos and give this place a try  the food is way better and they actually have a good wine selection!"", ""I was here for a business dinner on Monday night and the restaurant was pretty empty so the staff was super attentive. Perfect atmosphere for good conversation since you don't have to yell over music or other people. I didn't get a chance to look over the wine menu but whatever was brought to our table was delicious.\n\nWe started with the Warm Brie  which I still think about two weeks later. Cheesy goodness paired with Apricot Spread  Hummus  Grilled Vegetables and Grilled Flatbread. Great choice for a starter.\n\nFor the entree  I got the Poached Salmon with Citrus Risotto. It thought it was just okay. The sun-dried tomatoes were a little too heavy in flavor and it didn't go very well with the citrus risotto  IMO.\n\nCute place overall. I definitely want to come back to check out their happy hour."", 'We went there with a large group of about 30 people. I know that can be a challenge  but nevertheless  it does not warrant the wait staff to be rude. They were flat out rude to all of us. It was a clear they did not want us there  despite making a reservation. Overall  it is a nice place but not nice enough to overcome the staff.', 'In our continuing quest to identify cool  locally owned places to eat and/or drink  Caroline and I auditioned Vintage 95 last night. \n\nBefore I go further  understand that whenever I go out for eats or drinks  I have  in  mind a Platonic Ideal of the Bar/Pub/Eatery I most want to frequent. I\'m on a constant quest to find that  Ideal expressed in Real Life. \n\nVintage 95 isn\'t quite there  but it\'s damn close. If I ever give something Five Stars  you\'ll know it has pegged my Platonic Ideal. Anyway...\n\nThe plan last night was for drinks. No plans for food  just Adult Beverages and warm conversation. But it turned into more.\n\nThe location in downtown Chandler is terrific for us. The owners have created a very fine visual experience - leather  stone  dark woods  good lighting. And they don\'t have the music turned up so loud that you CANNOT HAVE A CONVERSATION. This is one of my pet peeves. If I want to stare at people move their mouths while enduring an aural assault  I\'ll stand on the deck of an aircraft carrier. When I go out with friends  I want to enjoy their company AND their conversation. Is that concept so difficult to grasp? [/rant off]\n\nThe atmosphere at Vintage 95 is very close to my Ideal. I\'d go back just to sit on the leather couches in front of the fireplace  and then go back another time to sit on the leather stools at the bar  and then go back about fourteen more times to sit out on the patio. Seriously - go check out the patio. It is EXACTLY what a Patio Hangout Bar should be. EXACTLY.\n\nCaroline and I told the hostesses we were only there for drinks  so we were seated in the bar area in some fabulous leather club chairs. It wasn\'t initmate  but we weren\'t looking for intimate. And speaking of the bar  even though V95 advertises itself as a wine bar  they DO have booze. I\'m not much of a wine drinker and was very pleased to see that they carried a pretty good selection of single malt scotches. Not an overwhelming selection  but well beyond the normal Glenfiddich /Glenlivit /GlenMorangie trio to which most places are limited. I had a couple of drums of Ardbeg  which is one of my new favorites and very reasonably priced at retail. (Scotch is never reasonably priced in restaurants  but I was celebrating so I didn\'t care.) Caroline had her normal ""vodka martini extra dirty extra cold"" which she judged to have ""perfect dirtiness""  (no wonder I love her!)  perfect amount of olives and very cold. \n\nThe limited Happy Hour menu had some very interesting choices. We settled on the bruschetta and the smoked tomato bisque. The bruschetta was VERY nice and quite unusual. You get to select four of eight choices for your bruschetta platter; we picked: (1) white bean and pancetta  (2) gravlax  caper goat cheese and pickled onions  (3) fig chutney  ricotta and prosciutto  (4) brie  pear and onion jam. They were all served cold  in nice sized portions and the flavors were all nicely balanced and very interesting. Caroline would have preferred the bread to not be so crispy  but I really liked it. The tomato bisque  was creamy  smoky and had well-balanced flavor. Caroline said it was unique and I say it was just darn delicious. \n\nThings being as they are  drinks and appetizers turned into food. A friend had told us ""you have to try the Vintage burger""  so we did. It came served with a mixture of regular and sweet potato fries  all nicely cooked and nicely seasoned. Recommended. The burger was VERY tasty. They obviously use good beef  the bun was fresh  the fixin\'s were tasty. HIGHLY recommended.\n\nIn for a dime  in for a dollar  right? So we ordered dessert. Again  the dessert menu is short  but I\'m okay with that as long as they do it well. Chocolate torte with hazelnut gelato  apple pie with carmel sauce and creme fraiche gelato  and something else we couldn\'t remember. I\'m allergic to hazelnut and don\'t like sweet desserts  so we decided to try the apple pie.\n\nLike everything else we had sampled  the apple pie was unusual - you wouldn\'t find it anywhere else. It was served on a freshly baked puff pastry  cubed apples served on top and inside - tender but not mushy -  with lots of cinnamon and sugar  plate was swirled with salted dolce la leche. It was tasty  but instead of the expected creme fraiche gelato  we were served hazelnut gelato. I didn\'t realize it was hazelnut until I\'d had a couple of bites and my throat started to swell up.\n\nAt this point that the night could have turned into a disaster  but to their credit - it didn\'t. We told the waiter who told the manager  (Gavin - one of the owners)  who immediately came and asked if I needed emergency assistance. I didn\'t  I\'m not THAT allergic.)  Frankly  their response was EXACTLY the kind of customer service you want to see. Anyone can make a mistake  so no harm  no foul. But I must give BIG Kudos to Gavin for his kindness  attention to detail and outstanding customer service.\n\nWe will DEFINTELY be back and I strongly recommend you put it on your list too.', ""Went here yesteday and sat out on the patio. A little pricey for what we typically spend on a night out  but great for a special occasion. We had the vintage flatbread  seabass  and their s'more dessert. All amazing and very very tasty.

Huge wine list & the staff do a great job helping you choose a wine you'll like. Also love the atmosphere."", ""We did the Groupon thing here with friends. The atmosphere  salad and appetizers were wonderful. The downside  to our visit were the entrees and the live entertainment. My wife's hamburger and my flatiron steak were way overpriced  even with the Groupon deal. The steak was served over beans that did not compliment the flavor. Our friend's salmon was very good but the vegetable entrée was a little strange tasting. Don't bother with Groupon for this place. We may return but it won't be for the entrée  probably be for a glass of wine and an appetizer. We will skip the entertainment as well. I never was a big melodica fan."", ""Meh... I went her a few days ago with my family for an early dinner. The food was so so. We waited nearly and hour and a half for our entrees after our appetizer. The kitchen didn't open until 5:00 and we got there just after 4pm. We had already been seated and ordered and app before our server told us the kitchen wasn't open until 5. We finally got our entrees around 5:45 and they were disappointing. We got the stink eye the entire time we were waiting because my mom ( who has blood sugar issues) asked the server for some bread while we were waiting. Her burger came out totally burnt to a crisp. It looked like a school cafeteria patty. Maybe intentionally after she asked for bread. The chef and a few other men were in the expediting area and were glaring at her while she ate. She wanted to complain but we had been there for so long already she just wanted to eat. My husband had the salmon and my brother had the duck. They both thought the dishes were very tasty. I had a salad that was good but not worth the $26 in my opinion. \n\nAll in all the vibe was off  the staff looked miserable  our food was mediocre and over priced. Probably will not return."", 'We have been there before and things have gone down hill.  Portions were small and ""happy hour"" wine selections not stellar.  \n\nWhile server was attentive at first  once we had paid bill - there were no longer visits to table for water or coffee refills.

I love the exposed brick and older building feel...makes me feel like I'm back home (Pennsylvania) when I'm inside the place. The food is INCREDIBLE!! Honestly  the brushetta is some of the best I've had. I compare all wine bar brushettas to Postino's which is one of my favorite  and I gotta say this is right up there. The one with the salami and ricotta is probably my favorite  it's to die for!! The pistachio/date or fig/with a maple flavor is also a fav. Honestly they are ALL good...the artichoke one is another fav...I could go on and on ;-) I had one of the dinner specials a few weeks ago  a monk fish over gnocci with an asparagus creme sauce...OH MY! It was SOOO good. I hope they special it again. A friend had their tomato bisque soup and their fries and I tried both and they were great. The fries are addictive. The wine list is huge and I haven't been disappointed yet. I've tried their chocolate dessert which was wonderful. Our service has always been on-point as well.

The pulled pork chilaquiles were fantastic and you can order a tapas size or entree size but the smaller portion was perfect. They have games and you can sit  drink and make it a Sunday fun day and don't forget a sorbet infused mimosa. Also you can linger on the back patio and have a relaxing environment  around the fire if the weather is cool. Live music for brunch. Just a great local place with good food."", ""Had a great experience here. Food was excellent the old-fashioned is on the better ones I've ever had"", ""I was excited to visit Vintage 95 because I've heard of this place before and I was in the area. When we got to downtown chandler  it was a zoo - I had no idea there was an artwalk  but I didn't want that to deter me from eating at this establishment.  \n\nSo we scored a parking spot relatively quickly - however  the wait to get a table was 45 minutes.  I hate waiting.... you had the option to eat appetizers (excluding entrees) at the front patio until a table was ready so we decided on that since I was starving. A perk is that they turned on the heater so we wouldn't freeze to death. Inside the restaurant is very charming  cute  rustic  and romantic. It would be a nice place to take a date  for sure.  \n\nOur order:  the popular bruschetta board - 1) Pistachio  Date and Marscarpone 2) Salami  Olive Pesto and Feta Mousse 3) Shreiner's Bacon Jam and Whipped Goat Cheese 4) Prosciutto  House Made Ricotta and Fig Honey and the Vintage flatbread - Fennel Goat Cheese  Prosciutto  Onion Jam and Arugula\n\nJust reading these ingredients made my mouth salivate - pesto  proscuitto  ricotta  goat cheese  pistachio  dates...mmmmmm.... right?!\n\nWe got our order and I was not impressed at all!  The flatbread was underwhelming and the bruschetta was ok - the bread was a little chewy.  After about 40 minutes or so  the hostess tells us that a table is ready  but we were already getting full and if the entrees were anything like the last two items we ordered  we decided to not take the chance. So we got our check and checked out the booths at the artwalk."", 'Really nice place to spend an evening with good friends  the bruschetta was wonderful  the service friendly and courteous and the atmosphere was really nice  with live music that was not too loud and quite lovely.  They have a really nice wine list with a variety of reds and whites at various price points from moderate to pricey.  I will definitely come here again.', ""So  I went here with my best friend- we both love wine. They have happy hour from 3p-6p daily  so we figured we'd give it a shot. The environment is nice- could be a great date night place given the lights are dimmed and the setting seems kinda romantic. Their HH menu isn't too extensive when it comes to the wine. They had 3 white & 3 red options for HH which was $5 per glass or $20 per bottle. I ordered a Cabarnet  which was good. \n\nOur server was new  so we didn't have high expectations (not meaning that to sound rude but you know how it goes with newbies :P). He was nice but kind of awkward; he tried to upsell a few times  which became frustrating given we told him we were only interested in the HH specials. We ordered the fries-which were delicious and the bruschetta  which was just okay. Honestly  the only wine place I've experienced is Postino and I would choose them over this place any day. I think Vintage is more suitable for those looking to spend a lot more money & to have that expensive style meal. Just from the menu  everything was highly priced and from watching other orders come out  seemed to not coincide with the portions given. I don't think I will be going back."", ""The food here was good  not great  but good. The ambiance was perfect for a lounging and vino.  I get it was a bit overpriced - but we may go back sometime. The service was really good  but I just wasn't wowed by the food."", 'Very unique place Wow has downtown chandler changed  Bruschetta is to die for and the smores desert is great also wonderful wine selection as expected but FYI they have a nice selection of unique beers also', 'First of all  credit where credit is due  the food was fantastic and they have a very good patio that was great for a nice Saturday night dinner.  Service  however  was somewhat shocking for a restaurant of this caliber.  My husband and I have been searching for restaurants in Chandler with good food and unpretentious service.  They scored big on the first count but failed miserably on the second.\n\nWe dropped in at about 4:45 on a Saturday for dinner.  We asked to sit outside.  The host said that was fine  the patio was empty but we would need to leave by 7:00 when he had reservations.  That\'s a bit odd to hear that we have to get out by a certain time  but we never take more than 2 hours to eat so no big deal.\n\nWe sit down outside and order drinks and an appetizer and eventually dinner.  Our waiter was ok  but not terribly attentive or friendly.  Again  not a big deal but somewhat off-putting.   I had the salmon (excellent!) and my husband has the burger which was also very good.  We finish by about 5:45 and ask to see a desert menu.   We are looking over the menu when the host shows up at our table and tells us we have to leave our table.  His 7:00 reservation for our table was there an hour early and he was kicking us out of our table.  ""Luckily "" though  he had a table inside we could squat at so that we could order desert and close out our tab.    He said he was sorry but he had to make these other people happy.  If we had just ordered a single round of drinks and mulled over them for an hour we might have understood  but we ordered several drinks  an appetizer  two entrees and were contemplating desert when he tried to kick us out of our table for a reservation that was a full hour early.  Had he told us we only had until 5:45 to eat and get out from the get go  we might have understood  but he told us 7:00.  \n\nWe told him to close out our tab and we would get the hell out of there like he clearly wanted.  He came back and said that we could stay out our table the reservation ""luckily"" wanted a different one.....no thanks!!!   He ended up buying us a round of drinks but  honestly  by that time we were pretty irritated.\n\nI get it.  We didn\'t have reservations on a Saturday night.  We were walk-ins and didn\'t expect to be treated like we had reservations.  Had they told us that meant we would need to be done by 6:00  I would have understood completely.  I felt  however  that they thought it was awesome to be there when they were completely dead  but once ""better"" people showed up  we needed to pay up and get the hell out.   Fairly sure this was our first and last visit.  Really a shame  as the food was excellent.', 'Amazing!  The cheese and bread with jam were delicious.  Service and ambience were great!  We sat outside because it was so nice out.  GET the bruschetta board!  Will be back soon.', ""I love this place. Everything is great. The tomato bisque is to die for  and the chicken panini is a regular order for me. Their bruchetta is comparable to Postinos  if you've been there  and the other cheese  olive  meat  etc. appetizers are big and delicious. I'd recommend this place over any in Downtown Chandler. It's my favorite! Seating is good inside and outside (huge fire pit is fun for big groups to sit around). I heard the Sunday brunch specials are also really awesome. It's a little pricier  but worth the quality and amount of food you get with each plate."", ""Vintage 95  you sexy young thing....! I stop by for lunch and I'm always thrilled. The lunch selection is perfect. I need to always get back to work and you always get me in and out in the right amount of time but with the just right amount of perfect lunch. Perfect!

The smores dessert was good  but nothing special.  It was like a dense brownie with a crust and marshmallow fluff topping.  It was good  but a bit too rich.  The burger was juicy and flavorful and came on a perfect bun.', 'What a great date night. I wanted to go somewhere different and this place was perfect. The décor and atmosphere are unique. The food was unbelievably great. This has become one of my favorite little spots.', ""It's a pretty neat place that tried really hard to deliver a unique experience. The food was above average and the wine selection was excellent. They could have offered a few more beers but that's ok. The only real set back for us was where we sat...right next to the hostess stand where we got to hear all about one of the girls flat chest and how she wished she had bigger...um...you know. Then the other hostess got to make out with her boyfriend when he showed up. That was special. So  if we could have moved away from that it would probably get 4 maybe even 5 stars for us."", ""This has definitely become one of my favorite spots for an evening of wine! \n\nI've been here a few times and have loved it ever since the first day. There are so many great things about this place. I love the atmosphere and the way the place is set up. When you walk in you can grab a table or sit by the cozy little fireplace that they have. I love their outdoor patio. It's big and they have two fire pits outside to sit by. Another plus is they also have live music there every night I believe. \n\nAs far as the food and drinks. I love me some Pinot Noir so I always order the Ramsay which is delicious. For food I've tried a majority of their bruschetta which is really good and have also had their Italian flatbread. They also have a happy hour everyday from 3-6  which I haven't been able to take advantage of yet. Their staff is also really great. Everyone is very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and they really take care of you. \n\nAll in all  it's such a great place to hang out with some friends for some amazing wine or also the perfect date spot. Take your ladies here fellas! They won't be disappointed. =P"", 'I don\'t want to leave a bad review. However  as business owners  we felt I needed to. The feedback is the only way to change a problem. The measure of a business is not how they handle good situations  but how they handle mistakes  and every business will make mistakes. I made reservations well ahead of time for 2 I\'m the afternoon. I stated in the online reservation comment box that it was for our 45th anniversary. We asked for a window table (only one) and for Nya  a server we had before. My husband got a phone call confirming our appointment and our request. When we get there the table had been given to someone else! We mentioned this and was basically told ""these things happen"". Land he gave a flippant apology clearly not respectful of the importance of this momentus occasion. The table was given to a young hip couple and by what the waiter said  we knew they were just given the table and had not reserved it well in advance. In addition my husband asked why they didn\'t put a reserved sign on the table and he replied they don\'t have any! REALLY? Any piece of paper with ""reserved"" hand written on it should do. They could have made everything right just by caring. Last person who appeared to be the owner or manager just listened to this and never intervened. We were polite  not disruptive but we were clearly unhappy. If I owned the business  I would have said  ""we made mistake  I am so sorry. For your inconvenience we will give you a free drink  appetizer  dessert or a coupon  etc."" or some other nice thing to do. I would have at least given a warm apology and happy anniversary wishes along with superb service to make it right. They were almost empty at the time. We did something we never do  we walked out before ordering and the arrogant owner/manager didn\'t seem to even care.! Like I said  we were polite  just unhappy that our reservation requests at an off time were not respected. We went (without reservations  of course) to another nice restaurant where immediately upon entering the door and saying it was our 45th anniversary  they treated us like royalty! We will never go back to Vintage 95 because oh their superior  snobby  uncaring attitude!', ""We sat on the couches because we didn't have a reservation. Dave  our waiter  was great. We had the bruschetta platter and warmed Brie with apricot jam. Both were fantastic and plenty for two. Next time we will make reservations and sit at a table.

I was referred to Erica @ Vintage to get everything planned. She was great and explained everything very thoroughly to me and made me feel confident that the night would be perfect. We arrived (last night) and our area on the patio was fantastic. Our every need was catered to by Emily  Ari  and John during our dinner. All of my employees loved their food and drinks; we had a great night and would (and have) recommend Vintage to other companies as well as family and friends!', ""Great food & nice atmosphere.

The patio was nice and the decor was lovely...but that is about all I have nice to say.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the pulled Pork Chiliquiles  I ordered the Banh-Mi Pork Tenderloin Sandwich. The other couple had Hawaiian Egg breakfast and Vintage Poutine. Their food came out to their liking but the food my boyfriend and I ordered may have been made at an entirely different restaurant.\n\nHis pulled pork chiliquiles were so salty  that after eating half...he abandoned them  forfeiting the option to take it home.\n\nMine on the other hand was a bit worse...The pork sandwich was coated in a sauce and under it was a grayish  dry slice of ""roasted pork"". I bite into it and was immediately introduced to a rancid  sour flavor with the consistency of jerky....I let my boyfriend (whom is a true garbage disposal when it comes to food  I assure you) and the other couple try to make sure it wasn\'t just me. They all agree that the meat had turned. I let the waiter know...who didn\'t seem to care either way. He asked if I wanted something else and seemed bit impatient while I looked.  The manager came and visited us  letting me know that they make their food fresh every morning and told me the rancid taste is due to  ""a different flavor profile than I am use to"".  I am not sure what flavor profile he likes  but sour  spoiled  meat isn\'t for me....so yes it is very different from my preferred flavor profile. \n\nI decided I would try the Hawaiian egg breakfast  it was better but very salty and greasy.\n\nNeedless to say my boyfriend and I won\'t be returning and 6 hours later my stomach isn\'t happy.\n\nSometimes Wine Lounges need to be Wine Lounges...and not food establishments.', 'we went here last monday for lunch we were 2 of 6 people in the restaurant  around i1140 am  we were prompley greeted n a sorta glad your here way and seated and told are server would be right with us.are server was polite we ordered are lunch our only complaint is are lunch took a good 25 minutes to get to us with like i say 6 people in the restaurant.

Interesting strategy. \nI had bruschetta and can\'t say much about any of my selections. My husband had the seared ahi and it was nice.

We started with the calamari which the Stuart recommended we have sautéed  again this was fantastic. And for afters we had the coconut tres-leche. \nThey have a tapas happy hr 3-6 so we will be going back for that next time. \nOver all we throughly enjoyed our evening. \nI recommend going for an evening post work snack or a romantic date night dinner."", 'Great attention by the bar staff  cozy atmosphere with some wine by the fireplace.

I had their drink that had ginger and peach  was actually very good  but expensive. The husband had a manhattan and liked it very much. My step mom and I split the gnocchi and the bruschetta and I had the tomato bisque with croutons. The tomato bisque was very tasty  smokey  I would get it again. The bruschetta was ok... the prosciutto was a little on the thick side. The bacon jam was very tasty. The gnocchi  on the other hand  was not so good...very dry and lacking flavor. It was nice that they split it into two bowls for us. The husband had the burger and liked it very much  I thought it was good  but not a 16$ burger. Overall  this place would be fine if their prices were lower  but I guess that's what you get for being a semi cool restaurant in Chandler."", 'Wonderful afternoon on the patio.

I do prefer their dinner menu to their lunch menu  but both are excellent.\n\nThe rest of my previous review still applies.  My one criticism is that they don\'t have a death-by-chocolate dessert.  But the desserts they do have are very good  and not the typical fare you find in most places.', ""Love the deals offered on Yelp. Went to a yoga event at the Crowne Plaza and came over here and paid $15 for $30 worth of food. My friend had their bruschetta board with four different options  I got to try a few and I liked them. I had the Sea Bass which I was not a fan of unfortunately. I expect Sea Bass to be light and this was very heavy. I will admit I tend to compare all Sea Bass to one I got in Texas  but this was a very heavy dish and after sweating outside in The July heat it was to much. They had live music and I liked the decor. Additionally the service was good and I appreciate they didn't give us a second glance when we walked in yoga pants. I will come back again and try something else."", 'No cook no food after 10? Dumb. Get drunk though.

I don't know if it was just an off night for our server Michael  but our special night became a night I seriously want to forget. \n\nWe had a reservation for 4:45 and requested an intimate table for 2. We arrived around 4:10 and the cheerful hostess seated us at near the fireplace by the wall. There's already a couple of ladies talking about their sons. So much for my request. Nevertheless our server quickly arrived and placed a couple of waters on our table and handed the menus. \n\nI ordered the Lamb Shank and my man ordered the Vintage Burger. Before having that  we asked for cups of their smoked tomato bisque. Soups arrive  tasty  just the right amount for a starter. Then  our server went to our table and apologized that all the dinner entrees can't be served until 5 except the vintage burger. He said he didn't know it as well. Bummer oh well  I ordered some bruchetta first. It was okay. Nothing exceptional. My man's vintage burger looks bomb though. I love the mix of regular potatoes and sweet potatoes. So since I enjoyed that  I wanted to order the burger as well if I can't have any other entrees. alright the server said. Then after a few more minutes he apologized again and said that it's prepping time  it'll be out in 15 more minutes. I said sure I'll wait. \n\n30 minutes passed  I just requested it to be To Go. My hunger passed already and my boyfriend was done with his food. hooray for our valentine's dinner night. Smh. Then when I requested the check  the Lamb Shank that I originally ordered was included in the receipt. So once again I had to call the attention of the server and ask to readjust the bill. Maybe it was Michael's (the server) off night. I too am a server and I get these moments. It's just really disappointing how on our valentine's dinner  I didn't have proper dinner. Oh well. On to the next hunt for a better upscale restaurant."", ""Vintage 95 is by far one of my favorite restaurants in Chandler  and a really great date spot! From the cozy ambiance  to the service  to the food  everything is great! I've tried the beef tenderloin and the sweet potato gnocchi  and both were absolutely delicious. \n\nAnd to top it off  when I was about 50% finished with my gnocchi  the server came over and mentioned that the sauce didn't look quite right. Although I told her it was delicious  and I proceeded to eat almost the entire dish  she came out with a completely new dish in a to go box for me to try later. Both were amazing  but I really appreciated her making sure I got the full experience and it was fully up to their standards. \n\nOverall  a great little restaurant!"", 'Great service  poor food quality!

I\'ve changed my review to 1 star.\n\nRegardless of the bad dinner experience I had on Christmas Eve  Vintage 95 has a great outdoor dining area that is very relaxed. Due to this  I decided that I\'d give Vintage another chance with a large party. I wanted to host a 20 person bridal event. I submitted a request via the website to have an event coordinator get in touch with me. 5 days later  I still hadn\'t received a phone call or email. I decided to send a follow up email to try to get someone to contact me. At 7 pm that evening  the event coordinator finally called. I explained to her that I don\'t have a budget  and that I wanted my guests to have a beautiful unforgettable lunch. She said that she would send me a proposal right away the next day. 4 days went by  and I still hadn\'t received a proposal or any other form of communication from the event planner. This was actually pretty surprising to me  since during our phone call she told me at least 5 times that she loves to bring these types of events together and make things memorable.\n\nAt this point  I decided that I wasn\'t going to chase someone around to give them my money. I\'d rather spend more money at a different restaurant to ensure that I\'m going to be given the customer service I deserve as a patron. \n\nOn August 8  I sent a message via Facebook to the restaurant  to explain my disappointment. I STILL haven\'t heard from a member of management or an owner. I know the message was read  because late the next evening the event planner left me a voicemail. She said that her boss called her to let her know I sent a message the day prior. Her exact words on my voicemail  ""I know the proposal was very late but at least I got it to you today"".......... Really?', ""The atmosphere and service here are amazing! This is definitely a wonderful date night location  especially if you are a wineaux.  The wine list is VERY extensive.  They have something (and then some) for everyone.  And we also really enjoyed the band that was playing during our visit.  The patio looks very inviting for a warm night.  Everything about the atmosphere here is on point!\n\nNow  for the food...unfortunately  the food wasn't as great as everything else.  If I was reviewing the food only  I would be giving 3 stars.  The food was just okay...and we were hungry! The hubby and I decided to share a couple of starters...the pork belly and veggie flatbread.  The menu said that the pork belly was smoked.  I have no idea how that is possible.  There was no smoky flavor whatsoever and the fat wasn't rendered as if it was smoked.  However  the jalapeno grit cake and maple glaze that came with it were great.  The veggie flatbread was also a letdown.  The sauce was extremely sour and just didn't go well with everything else.  So  while I have no problem paying for a good meal  I think our meal was overpriced for what we got."", ""Decided to try this place late on Friday evening for some cocktails. We sat out on the patio which I was very impressed by. The seating was comfortable and clean with a chill ambiance. Our server was very nice and attentive. I ordered a Jameson and cranberry  which is what I would have expected. Others in the party ordered off the drink menu and the drinks were delish!! I can't wait to come back and try their food!"", ""Like the 5 star rating says...Woohoo!  As good as it gets!

We had a party of 16 and the service was great.  The server was sharp  quick to meet our needs  and a pleasure to talk with.  Many in our party had never visited and they all loved the atmosphere...and the company of course!\n\nOne of the great things about Vintage 95 are the cheese plates  served on butcher block  with your personalized choices of cheese  (you can personalize your meat choices to if you wish) they have nuts  olives  dried fruit...all which pair great with your favorite wine.  \n\nWe love wine and if you love wine or are interested in tasting wine  Gavin  the owner  has created a remarkable wine list  and is very acommodating to all of his customers...Just ask for him or his manager and they will help with wine selections and then sit back and enjoy the live music  and the fire place.

The bartender has recommended several red wines  all of which were wonderful.  I've only eaten here once.  We had the bruschetta.  You get to pick a combo of four and all of them had great complimentary flavors.  We also had the Seared Duck Breast with Chipotle Sweet Potato Gratin and a Cherry Mojo and it was excellent.  I'm an avid listener of local music and they have some wonderful musicians here.  I've heard Sarah Vanell  several times and another favorite was Vinyl Station."", ""I just moved here from California retired from the state. I've been wanting to stop in and last week I did.

See you there."", ""Has a lovely decore and ambiance.  We had questions about wine and we were helped by a wine expert  who nailed what we were looking for on the first try. Food was pretty good  I had the sea bass - I loved the brussel sprouts with it but wished it came with a less heavy barley/gravy type bed under it.  My companion has salmon  which also came on a bed of some sort of heavier side dish.  I would suggest just letting the fish star in the show :) I may stick to appetizers next visit.  The bruchetta choices were unique and tasty.\n\nI'm going back this week with a different friend.  Great place to take out of towners!"", ""They have chosen their eclectic wine menu very selectively. And their food pairings are very appropriate and tasty. But my honest feeling is that their pricing points are 30%-40% higher than they should be. They do try make good with it with the quality of their staff (especially Richard at the bar). But if you go in as a couple (even during happy hour) and have a couple glasses of wine each  share an appetizer and each get an entree  you'll easily be over $100 with tip. Good stuff  but not that good."", ""Rating is based on 2 visits. \n\nOur first visit a few weeks ago was awesome. Great waiter (friendly & clearly communicated) and 1/2 price wine bottles on Sunday = awesome. Tonight  well... if it weren't for the company... A friend and I met for happy hour  arriving at 4. I guess I could have looked at menu more closely after a long day and challenged our waiter's suggestion  but I trusted our waiter to steer me to a good wine at a good price. It was HH! This was not a good decision - based totally on previous visit. He mentioned 2 Sauvignon Blancs - one from France that he didn't recommend. I took his recommendation. I learned neither was the HH wine (found out later the HH SB was from Chile). He didn't mention this. So when the bill came...shock. At almost $100 before tip  that's when we learned we didn't get happy hour deals. Our check showed $10 and $15 per glass - which we felt was expensive for Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc plus 1 appetizer - a combo meat and cheese board that was not all that - during HH. We joked that we should have met at Flemings. We'd eat & drink better for the same price. But we wanted to support a Downtown Chandler business. When my friend returned for her keys (after dessert elsewhere)  that's when we asked the hostess to check happy hour menu. Guess we were had. Never again. I'm wiser now. If you go for happy hour  make sure your waiter doesn't lure you to spend more. Smart business to up sell? Not if you want return customers."", 'I really wanted  to like this place.  I am hoping we just had back luck given many positive Yelp reviews; however our experience was less than adequate.  There are many choices for restaraunts in the valley and I would suggest this one be avoided. It takes little to make us happy so keep this in mind.  Our server (no intro) initially was not warm and in fact seemed cold so I tried to warm him up a bit and asked if he smiled? He responded he was fine  ""Just not Mickey Mouse.""  1/2 a strike maybe as I get not everyone outwardly is happy. In the end he warmed up and tried to make things right.  I ordered Sangria to which I hoped would be amazing but not so much.  I have drank a lot of Sangria in my life and this by far was the worst I have had.   Sangria went back to the bar as kool-aid better. When we did finally get our order  most of the guys who ordered burgers did not get fries despite note of inclusion on the menu.  My husband and I ordered pork sliders and the turkey  jalapeño and avocado sliders.  The BBQ pork sliders were frozen in the middle and the avocado slices in turkey were not ripe.  Really  overall a bit of a miserable food experience on a beautiful Easter Sunday.  Our meal was comped but we ended up eating a side of fries and calling it good.  Our son had pancakes and he ate all 3 and loved them but they looked exactly the same as anything you would make at home. He was happy though. Not a single piece of garnish came on the orders and in fact none of our party of 13+ had any plate presentation going for them at all.  Last straw was the executive chef (picture attached) who must be for oversight only. He spent a good amount of time checking his phone  argued about visibly frozen food when we flagged him down to take ot back and noticeably forgot an apology.  Sorry Vintage 95  we will not be back or recommending you. Bummed', 'The evening in short:\n\nWent here for restaurant week on 5/18/15. In summary: overpriced for the food quality  good service but poorly managed  nice decor but tight quarters  inedible short ribs.  Don\'t waste your time or money  hit up Earnest instead if you\'re in Chandler.  1 star based on the price to value ratio  the overall experience and how annoyed I was by the end of the meal (would have been a 2.5 or 3 star experience but for the short rib which I explain in detail below).\n\nService: 4 stars\nApps: 3 stars\nEntree: 0 stars\nDessert: 3.5 stars\nDecor: 3 stars\nManagement: 0 stars\n\nThe details if you dare:\nI went here with my ""ex-lover"" (he requested to be referred to as such for this review) for restaurant week last Monday for the $44 pre fixe menu.  Spoiler alert: majorly disappointing and it wasn\'t because I was there with my ex.\n\nWe had reservations for an early dinner and were seated immediately at the back of the restaurant at a table for two by the wine room in a fairly empty room.  First impression - loved the decor!  It was obvious some care went into the choice of furnishings and end result looks great. The mixture of leather couches and high and low top solid wood tables were gorgeous.  But once we were at the table for a minute and others were seated at surrounding tables it became apparent that they had tried to squeeze too many tables in too small a space.  The servers couldn\'t maneuver around the guests\' chairs and were constantly bumping into each other and the other seated patrons.  Even with the tight quarters they managed to keep our drinks and waters full and stop by at all the right times  kudos to them. \n\nThe food portion of the evening started out ok  we got the pork belly and gaspacho soup as appetizers  both of which were decent although the gaspacho was not exactly what I expected (more like blended cold tomato soup with no chunks of veggies in it unlike typical gaspachos  it was still refreshing though).  We both ordered short rib for our main entree.  They took a while to come out which would have been find if it had been edible when it arrived.  When I got mine the meat was so hard I was a bit hesitant (and as it turns out rightly so) to try it.  I pulled apart the first piece with some effort and it was pretty gray inside and looked kind of dry.  I made the mistake of tasting it and wow was it worse than it looked.  It was extremely dry and stringy and tasted off.  Like they had made it the previous week  left it in the fridge uncovered and then heated it up in a super hot oven so whatever was left of the moisture evaporated and left a gray flavorless mess.  It was so bad I had to spit it out  and were you to ask my dining companion he would get a far off look in his eye and tell you with a bit of remorse that I am not a spitter. To add insult to injury the mashed potatoes under the short ribs were cold. The ex\'s short ribs were better but still not what I would expect from a place this pricey with 4 stars on Yelp.  I ended up sending mine back and they sent out another plate which was better but still not great and certainly not worth either the wait or the portion of the $44 that would have been allotted to cover the main dish.  My companion was done with his by the time my replacement meal came out  so I had a few bites and decided to wait for dessert to see if the meal could be salvaged.  We had the S\'mores Chocolate Tarte (probably the best thing of the evening  very rich and very well executed) and the Coconut Tres Leches cake which the ex liked but I thought was meh (not a fan of Tres Leches anyway).  Then the bill showed up.  The server took care to explain that there was an extra charge for the third Short Rib on the check and pointed out that the charge had been removed at the bottom of the check.  I thought he was trying to explain that they had comped all or part of my meal (which I would have expected given how terrible the first short ribs were)  but when we looked at the check it was exactly as he had described.  They charged full price for what was essentially half a meal with a ruined main course and ""comped"" the extra $44 that was for the replacement short ribs.  That sealed the deal for both of us  neither of us will be back. I may have been tempted to give it another shot since I like the concept  the location (close to home) and the service but instead the management lost possible repeat customers and earned a 1 star Yelp review by charging full price for a poorly executed  sub par meal.', 'My wife and I had a great time. Nice atmosphere  good food  and great drinks. The vintage mule is best IMO. Will definitely be back.', ""We went to this amazing Wine Bistro on Jane's  Birthday....and had an memorable experience.

As I said  this is what eating out should be.\n\nWe didn\'t do anything from the ""starter"" section.  Our starter was a bruschetta order.  Theirs is not those little 2"" bread circles.  They appear to have taken a full Italian loaf and sliced it thick (about an inch).  Four pieces (there are six to choose from)  all very unusual and unique.  This really is a meal all by itself.  Now I\'m not really a cheese guy.  I like mozzarella  ricotta  paremsan  and such (i.e. Italian cheeses usually on Italian food).  These things have goat cheese  feta  cream cheese  etc.  I didn\'t really expect to like these  but this was a treat for my lady and she LOVES different cheeses.  Well  I tried them...and they were good!  I think I liked the salmon and pesto one best (I forget which cheese was on it).\n\nIf you\'re a Spaniard you\'ll think of these as tapas.  And they are very much like that.\n\nAs I had planned to leave most of the bruschetta to my wife (which I did) I had ordered the tomato bisque soup.  It was very good.  Very thick  which I liked.\n\nFinally  my wife had the BLT salad and I had the pulled pork.  I almost went with the grinder  but wanted a hot sandwich (and the grinder is cold).  Both were excellent.  I was a bit hesitant because my pulled pork standard is Joe\'s Real BBQ  and that\'s simply one of the best ever.  But this was a very respectable (and delicious) sandwich.  Most places I would not order the pulled pork because it is such a disappointment compared to Joe\'s  but this one I would order again.  It holds up well against Joe\'s.  (Joe\'s is a bit better but it\'s not a rout.)  My wife really (really!) liked her BLT salad.\n\nWe were so enjoying everything that  despite being quite full  we ordered one of their desserts.  The lady chose the coconut tres leches.  I\'m not a fan of coconut  so you can\'t really go by me.  But she loved it.  It was a large piece  and she really enjoyed the flavor.\n\nWe really enjoyed the entire dining experience.  The seating  the ambiance  the attentive servers  and of course the food.  My wife was saying ""best lunch ever!""  and even posted such commentary on Facebook.  She was actually excited by the meal.  When was the last time that happened to you?  I\'m pretty sure if you\'re reading this that it didn\'t happen at the Olive Garden or Chili\'s!  But I\'ll bet it will happen here.\n\nSorry for the novel  but this place deserves it.  It\'s a tad pricey  but you easily could go to a chain and pay comparable prices for a meal for two that wouldn\'t be as good.  We will be coming back.  The menu isn\'t huge  so I wouldn\'t want to come so often that I get tired of it.  But I do want to come back and have another dining experience like we had today.', 'Thai steak  ribeye  beef tenderloin are incredible. Wine was good. Bruschetta was fair. Brie was very good.

One more thing I was simply so bummed about was they discontinued the rock shrimp and that was my FAVORITE. I still ask every time I go in just to see if they will bring it back. :) You just cannot beat the wine and beer selection  the delicious food  and the great ambiance.

It was a rehearsal dinner so every detail needed to be met - nobody wants the bride to freak out.  Vintage 95 was great in every way.  The food was phenomenal; very different but still well balanced.  The ambiance was perfect.  Luckily for us  the weather was in our favor that night as well.  The wine and beer were ever-flowing thanks to great servers/bartenders.  They never let my glass stay empty and even remembered what I was drinking; not an easy task for a party of that size.

You should dine here too."", 'We have been here several times  for drinks and also for dinner. We love the atmosphere  and the setting is intimate. On the two occasions that we had dinner  we were very pleased with the food. The bruschetta is excellent  as was the summer salad w/chicken.

I was disappointed that they do not offer other sandwiches on the dinner menu though  and do find their selection of wines by the glass very limited. For those reasons I am only awarding 3 stars.', ""My fiancé and I walked in and immediately were put off by the live music  a young girl singing and playing acoustic guitar but  despite our better judgement  decided to stick with Vintage 95 due to our lack of a back up plan. We were seated in the very back  closest to the kitchen and registers  presumably because she and I were the youngest (and most heavily tattooed) patrons in the restaurant. \n\nWe were sat directly next to a repugnant couple of 50-somethings who simply would not and could not stop groping each other. Not even reasonable PDA  like her hand under his shirt onto his nasty hairy chest.  \n\nMy fiancé and I came here to celebrate my promotion at work and we were looking for good cocktails. I prefer whiskey/bourbon cocktails and their online menu looked promising  but the menu we received was incredibly limited in comparison.\n\n The cocktails were decent enough and fairly typical. We ordered the bruschetta which was the best thing we ate  although not by much. We each ordered a flatbread; I had the italian and my fiancé had the vintage  which she felt was entirely too sweet. The sauce on my italian flatbread tasted like chef boyardee. \n\nAs the night went on the young girl's live music became more irritating and her voice more shrill. Frankly  I don't need to hear multiple Sara Barielles covers while I'm trying to enjoy my sub-par meal. To accompany the undesired entertainment  a little girl who apparently had just come from a ballet recital began dancing in the middle of the restaurant.\n\nOur server was honestly a little below standard but she was probably the best part of our dining experience  so we weren't offended. By the end of  the night we were more than relieved to be out of Vintage 95 and will not be coming back.\n\nIf you enjoy over priced sub-par food  50-something PDA  and 6 year olds in tutus dancing to abrasive live music then Vintage is for you."", ""A place for the senses!!\n\nAs soon as you walk in  you're greeted with warmth from the hostess staff (first impressions start at the front  and are very crucial). we decided to belly up to the bar  and were instantly guided with knowledge and grace from the bartender( I forgot his name). With a chef and wine driven concept  I usually hand my menu to the server/bartender  and let them order for me  and which I did in this case  and he guided us perfectly. We started with the bruschetta sampler  Brie app  and Italian flatbread  wow!! I asked the bartender to recommend a red wine with everything  and the cab he chose was perfect. As we enjoyed our culinary picassos  I gazed around and enjoyed the rustic feel of the brick walls and exposed ceiling  and the big leather sofas next to the fireplace was a really nice touch. Definitely a place to bring someone special in your life that you just want to chill with and relax with. We then moved on to the tomato bisque  which was perfectly silky and not heavy at all. After that  the cheeseburger (a must have). If I could sit there for 24 hours and enjoy every menu item  I would  my taste buds were very happy. \n I'm no food critic  but if I was  this place would be on top of my list of places to go.

We decided to sit out in the patio to enjoy the good weather. We both ordered the $5 crafted cocktails  which were good for its price.  We also decided to get some snacks  so went with the Piri Piri Fries and the Arancini.  The Piri Piri fries had a spicy taste to it  which we both liked.

Open and spacious room  but cramped seating space. This place could benefit from removing either the couches or a few of the tables  so people dont bump into your table or chair as they try to use the restroom or exit the building.  Our waiter didn\'t seem to know much about wine varietals. He basically stood there waiting for us to decide without any recommendations from his own wine list. Here\'s a thought.....if someone is unfamiliar with your particular wine list  ask them questions about what type of wines they enjoy? What kind of palette experience they are looking for. Simple enough for anyone to be able to recommend a wine or two from their own list  assumimg they have done their homework. Not all Cabs are alike  buddy! Hmmmmm  and you call yourself a wine bar?\n He did  however know enough about the menu  to recommend a decent dish. \nThis ""wine bar"" is like many others out there.

This is a pricey place  and for what they charge you would expect really upscale food  I ordered the braised lamb pasta  which was ok. Lamb was tender and sauce was alright  but chunks of pasta was stuck together.  They offered to remake for me  but why bother. I see people just come in for a drink or appetizer for the ambiance. Maybe that is what it good for.', 'Great spot for chilin drinking wine or for date night.\n\nNice large patio and inside decor is dark and comfy  with couch seating as well as tables.\n\nMost of the eats are good especially bruschettas. \n\nBit pricey place but normal for these type deals.', 'Had family that was going to a show at the Chandler Arts Center  so we wanted something close by that was nice. Chose this place off of Google Map and so glad we did.  The hostess was friendly and had our table ready and waiting with ice water already set up.  Our server Axel was very friendly and helpful with choosing drinks and food.  We started with the happy hour brie for $5 which is very small but very good  I would say only shareable if you are getting something else. We also tried the bruschetta board which almost every restaurant has these days.  The toppings we chose were delicious and the bread was good but a little too thick for my liking. For dinner I had the Ahi Tuna topped with a homemade kimchi over what I can only describe as rice patty heaven!!!  I also tried one of the salads which had pistachios  banana chips and dried papaya I think  either way it was also really delicious.  Its a great place to sit and have some bites and wine or for dinner.  They have a small patio with a long table that looks like fun with a larger party and cooler weather.', 'Came for NYE. The place was pretty dead but we went anyways. Good music by 2 guys. On our way out  we saw a rat run by! The musician saw him too!

The duck was to bland and the sauce was to hard to glaze or dip I could turn the cup upside down and it would not spill.. You would probably have to wait five minutes for it to get on the floor and as for my burger it was over cooked and dry.. It was a pork and beef patty  sounds awesome! Right? Well not here but made well I am sure could be magnificent.. This place it more of a tapas and wine not dinner.. Even thin it was to-go I live directly infront this restaurant so no time was wasted in eating a fresh dish.', 'I love this place!

I had the Reuben and the tomato bisque. Both were delicious. My mom enjoyed the turkey panini. She ordered a patron margarita and I had the ginger's a peach. Excellent drinks  especially mine! It was different and very refreshing to sip while out on their patio. HOWEVER  I have two complaints. First  the amount of flies is disturbing and very disgusting. It was not just one or two flies... It was honestly really gross. Perhaps because the patio is right next to the trash cans behind the restaurants? Meh. Another complaint: my mom's margarita was $15. She got two  which means we paid $30 for two margaritas. Lol. I feel like that price tag was a little ridiculous. If the fly swarms diminish and the margarita price becomes reasonable  I could boost this place to 4 stars easily.

It was an excellent choice.\n\nBeautiful patio and although it was very busy  we could hear well enough to have a very nice conversation with the couple we were with. Our waiter was terrific..very attentive and helpful in choosing our meal. The food was wonderful and beautifully served. My husband had the ahi tuna and a Caesar salad and said the tuna was the best he's ever tasted.  The three others had pear salad which was so good  and then had the duck breast as our entree.  It was also excellent!\n\nOur only complaint is the mark-up of wine.  The selection is wonderful (we even own some of it so we know the purchase price) but most choices were marked up at least by three.  We've experienced this at other restaurants in the Phoenix area as well so it must be typical.

We really enjoy dining on the patio out back.', 'Excellent wine selection  atmosphere  and the cheese board/salad I had were both lovely.', 'First visit last week. Enjoyed a warm evening on the back patio which had some powerful misters. The service was attentive and cocktail happy hour was half price! We enjoyed the amazing burger and a pork chop  and were both very satisfied. Very definitely going back.', ""We made our first trip to Vintage 95 this week and overall I was impressed.  The new owners have done an awesome job with the building and decor.  The interior has a nice wine cafe feel while the outdoor patio has an upscale hotel patio look complete with high end outdoor furniture and fire pits.  It's a great place to hang out and have dinner or a glass of wine this time of year.\n\nPros: The pulled pork and bruschetta that we had were amazing! The food was fresh  portions were nice and it all tasted amazing.  Whoever is running their kitchen definitely knows what they're doing.  Aside from the food  the building and decor were the second big selling point.\n\nCons: This restaurant really missed the mark with their staff.  The hostess was nice but struggled with where to put the six of us despite the fact that there weren't many people in that night (alone  not that big of a deal).  Our waiter was nice but couldn't tell us much about the menu items or specialties (they only have a one page menu at launch).  We were pleased to find wine from one of our favorite wineries  Arizona Stronghold  but really disappointed that the waiter couldn't tell our friends anything about the wine and completely butchered the location calling it Cochise Valley.  Sorry dude  it's Cochise County and that is a major flub against this AZ native.  Finally  it was great to see the owner come out and show off his new digs to his friends  but a word to the wise  we are the customers  you should make an effort to come over and welcome us and thank us for coming in.  It's repeat business from customers like us that will dictate your success in the future.  The reality is that the owner and staff form the personality of the establishment and ultimately that's what keeps people coming back (check the wait at an Anthony Canecchia or Joe Johnston restaurant to test that theory).\n\nSo  this place has a lot going for it and if the owner starts tending to his customers and can sharpen up his staff  they may have a recipe for success."", 'Went to this place before having dinner elsewhere.  I ordered the warm Brie appetizer and it was fantastic.  Next time I will stay and order from the dinner menu.  The staff are nice and the decor is pleasant.  I will return.', ""I've been here for lunch a few times  and I'm definitely a fan. I've tried different entrees each time  and they were all good. The Italian flatbread was tasty  the sandwiches were delicious  and the salads are top-notch. They even have a great beer selection. Staff is friendly. The ambiance is nice. Overall  this is one of the best bars/restaurants for many miles around. Highly recommended."", ""Great place to grab and drink or meet a friend to chat. A longtime friend and I came here to catch up after a long time of not seeing each other. The waitress was just attentive enough not to be annoying but also was available when we needed. Didn't try the food but there was a pretty good selection of wines. The decor inside is wonderful and cozy  and the patio is a great place to have a group as well. It's in a nice area of town if you want to walk around and see the quaint shops.\nDefinitely a place to visit again!"", 'I\'m rating this solely on the hostess. We went in 12-30-16 to enjoy a glass of wine and watch the duo play guitar.  Upon arriving the hostess asked us where we would like to sit. My aunt pointed to an empty couch. Hostess replied ""obviously thats taken because there are girls sitting across from it.""  Puzzled  I said ""ok  why don\'t you just seat us then."" \nHer reply  "" yes I\'m the hostess that\'s my job"" with sincere bitchery.  I just stood there and stared in complete shock. I could have just slapped her in the face. But I held my composure and she sat us. Never ever have we been insulted by anyone let alone a hostess. What terrible service. This establishment needs to take a closer look at this young lady (if that\'s even what you can call her).  She is the first face everyone sees.  We should have just left but really wanted to try out the wine.  Well OBVIOUSLY the most she will ever be is a hostess if she continues to be such a rude brat. Millennials are the worst!   Won\'t be going back here. Wine was overpriced as well.', ""wow. this place is a gem.  highly recommend it if you're looking for a great place to take a date or chill with some friends out in the patio over some wine. \n\nvisited friends in the phoenix area over thanksgiving vacation and they took us here on a Saturday night.  i dont know much about the chandler area but this place could easily rival any of the popular wine lounges here in san diego.  \n\nas for food  our group ordered a bunch of the bruschettas  flatbreads and a couple sandwiches to share family style.  we all enjoyed all of it  i especially recommend the fig chutney  that was absolutely amazing.  from the sandwiches  the shrimp blt definitely stuck out as my favorite.  overall  everything was very good and the service was great. \n\nas for the wine  great selection. the staff was very helpful in helping us pick out the perfect bottle based on what we like. in fact  i think i found my new favorite wine thanks to them.  if you're a wino like me  you'll love this place.  \n\nas for the ambiance  they nailed it.  awesome patio and great decor.  the attention to detail is definitely noticeable. very chill spot. \n\nps. check out the door to their wine cellar  i want that in my house. it's gorgeous."", 'I would like to personally thank Grant and Wheeler for a night but I will never forget.\n\nThe service the food and the drinks are certainly worth a stop in  I highly recommend the patio.', 'We were quite disappointed in our experience last night at Vintage 95. When we arrived for our reservation  they led us to an outdoor table directly under misters. It was 7:30 in the evening  the sun was setting  and we were being soaked by the water coming off the mister. We asked to be reseated  and they offered to turn the misters off. We almost left at that point  and after our evening we wish we had. \n\nOur waiter was initially prompt  informative  and gave some solid drink recommendations. We placed our food order  and waited. And waited. And waited. Our salad order took about twenty minutes  maybe even longer. The waiter commented there was a mixup in the kitchen  but they would be right out. \n\nOur meals  two burgers and two steaks  took over an hour to receive. When we finally got them  they were all over cooked (and unevenly cooked). My medium rare burger was partially medium on one side and medium well on the other. The bacon had seen better days for sure. My husband had cold potatoes to go with his steak  as did our friend. The steaks ended up being cut up for the dogs at home  they were so poorly prepared. The service did not continue as it had started  it became lax and we almost had to flag him down a few times to receive our bill. \n\nClearly we will not be going back. The only part of the night we truly enjoyed was our drinks  and catching up with our friends. Other than that it was pretty dismal.', 'Great service  food was definitely delicious (Recommend the Burger).

Great plave great vibe', ""We have been in for lunch many times working in Downtown Chandler and it has always been very good.  Decided to try it for dinner with my husband.  Food was absolutely amazing.   Hubby had the tenderloin and I had the Rib-eye.  Both were done to perfection and the sides were wonderful as well.  Portion sizes were generous without being massive. We both had a glass of wine and the wine list is pretty good if a bit pricey.  The ambiance and decor are outstanding.  The only reason I did not give it five stars was the fact that the waiter who has served me at least 10 times for lunch didn't even begin to recognize me and asked if we had ever been there before  he was also a little on the slow side for refills. There was no bread either which we thought odd."", 'Cool little spot. Love the bar and the couches for lounging and enjoying a glass of vino. Food is also really nice. I love the beet salad with chicken. There is something about the chicken  always moist and flavorful. Highly recommend...', 'Loved the relaxed atmosphere!! We sat at the bar and the service was great!! Food was very good! Definitely will go back!!', ""What an adorable place.  I've always knows it's been there for the last few years but had never had an opportunity to go.  Urban chic right in the heart of Downtown Chandler. \n\nThe inside is really cute and comfortable.  Exposed brick  comfy chairs and tables all set in intimate conversation spaces.  There was a piece live band singing contemporary ballads adding to the ambiance.  We chose to sit outside on the back patio (there is a small front patio as well).  The back patio is really nice and comfortable as well.  Big fire pits surrounded by comfortable couches and other seating areas as well.  Twinkle lights adorn the entire outside and again  more exposed brick add to the vintage urban flair.  \n\nThere is an EXTENSIVE wine list as well as some really interesting cocktails and beers.  We were only in for drinks but asked to see a food menu and that looked interesting as well.  I can't speak to how well we liked the food but we will try some next time.  \n\nThe only reason I am not going for the full 5 stars here is that the staff seemed a little stiff.  The hostess who greeted us was somewhat curt and our server was good but no-nonsense.  There wasn't anything wrong with them at all  they just weren't as welcoming to us first timers as I would have thought.  As we were leaving  we passed many wait staff and not one of them cracked a smile or said good-bye.  Really  none of this is a very big deal nor will it stop me from coming back  I just wanted to explain why I didn't give the full 5 stars.  I definitely look forward to giving Vintage 95 another try  and another try  and so on and so on...."", 'What a darling place!  Wonderful atmosphere and great food.

Everyone at the table enjoyed their selections. The musician that night had a beautiful voice and the live music really added to the experience. We will definitely be back.', ""The food at Vintage 95 and the array of wine choices offered are spectacular.  However;  be aware that the prices for the glasses and bottles of wine are seriously thievery if you've ever traveled to Europe.  I lived in Europe for two years and love the French  German and northern Italian wines and Champagnes.  Vintage charges $36 a glass or $140-180 dollars a bottle for Italian Amarone Valpolciella.  That is a top red wine of the Veneto region of Italy.  There you can buy a bottle of it for $22-25 Euro a bottle and here the same is $58-$70 a bottle for Amarone. To charge $36 a glass is just ridiculous.  I think they count on the fact that Americans are enthralled with all things Italy and charge these prices.  In Italy you can drink a nice Pinot Grigio for .60 Euro cents a glass or a nice red for 2-4 Euros a glass.  Be cautious of what you're paying for  and go to Total Wine and buy a nice bottle of Tommasi Amarone for $58 or a Classico or Ripasso for $12-$30 a bottle."", ""Completely head-over-heels IN LOVE.\n\nFound them thru Yelp and I was not disappointed.\nIn fact  it was 100% what I was looking for.\n\nI wanted a place to sit down and have a nice long catch-up conversation with a friend while possibly eating just a few shared appetizers  or going the whole hog and having dinner.\n\nI arrived early enough (5:30-ish) to catch the happy hour specials  and stayed long enough to have just about everything on the menu.\nIt would probably be wise to have a reservation for the prime time 6-8-ish hours  as the place filled up fast.\n\nWe were sat at the couches in the back which were just fine  even to have a meal.\nThe service was PERFECT.  Our waitress came around often and just at the right time  never interrupting and always ready when we needed something.\n\nStarted with a charcuterie board (I'm sure I've spelled that wrong) which could be a small meal.\n\nKept chatting and eventually wanted more food and drink.\nHad an amazing green salad  and my friend had the duck entree.\nEventually we had to satisfy our sweet tooth.\n\nOMG - please eat the peanut butter creme brulee.

Keep going what you're doing."", ""I went here with a large group and was pretty impressed with the service getting out our orders quickly for a group of 10.\n\nWe sat on the patio - which is large and has some large fire pits on it  which would be nice during winter months. Was a nice night and a great place to sit. \n\nWe all really liked the V95 board. The meats were warm and delicious - and pretzel bread accompaniment? Yes  please. Versus the Artisan board - the cheeses were good  but the meats were sliced thin and almost sour tasting. The truffle cheese was delicious. Would almost be better to have two different boards with the different sausages and cheeses. \n\nOn to dinner. I opted for the restaurant week menu to try everything out.\nFirst: Smoked Pork Belly on a Crispy Jalapeño Grit Cake with Maple Glaze and topped with Tabasco Coleslaw. Wow. Was delicious. I'm not crazy about maple anything  but the flavor combinations of this were just right. Salty and sweet and spicy with the grit cake and the tabasco coleslaw. The pork belly was crispy and soft and complimented the corn cake just perfectly. \n\nSecond: Braised Beef Shortrib on Charred Tomatillo Mash Potatoes with a Mole Sauce  Tortilla Hay and Sesame Seeds. The shortrib was a little on the dry side  but the sauce is what made the flavor. The tomatillo mashed potatoes were outstanding. Just something different - and again  perfectly paired with the mole shortrib sauce and perfect crunch with the tortilla hay. \n\nThird: I'm not much of a dessert person  but definitely wish I would have ordered the S'more - it looked like graham cracker crust  with a brownie on top with marshmallow fluff.. vs. my sorbets  which I loved each - the pineapple is creamy - the other two not as much  but each had great strong flavors. \n\nOverall  I would definitely recommend it. The service was quick and very good  and the food and ambiance was also a plus. I will definitely go back.\n\nNote - I would say if you want to go with a friend and catch up  I wouldn't sit inside with the live music - it can get hard to hear."", 'Sunday afternoon and the Chandler area was very busy but this place.

I love this location and always enjoy coming to Chandler away from the crazy crowd of Scottsdale.\n\nVintage 95 is wine bar that serves up some contemporary American style food with local and fresh ingredients. The place itself is beautifully put together; classical mansion style! I came with a date and we started with looking at their drink menu. Vintage 95 has a awesomely constructed wine room with a chandelier to show it off! My dated ordered a cocktail drink while I just shot for the Tempranillo. For out food we started with the Artisan board with aged Gouda  Prosciutto  pickles  salted almonds  bread  grapes  and crostinis with a strawberry jam. Overall  a solid start to my wine; the aged Gouda was solid cheese  but perfect texture to mix with our pickles and cured meat. The strawberry jam was totally fresh and meshed well with our bread and crostini. For our entrees  my date ordered the Flatiron Steak while I went for the Pork Chops. Both protein was cooked to perfection  which we both ordered medium. The brussel sprouts was excellent according to my date whom doesn\'t really eat brussel sprouts. My pork chops has a perfect sweet bite because of the roasted cherry tomato and lemon mustard cream while the texture was slightly chewy. It came along with an over-easy egg too!\n\nIn the end  Vintage 95 is definitely one of my go to spots or my ""ace"" when it comes to places to recommend. - Enjoy!', 'This was our first visit to Vintage and it was mediocre at best.  The atmosphere was the only saving grace.  Service was slow and the food was disappointing.  Perhaps it is just a wine bar and food is not a priority here.  \nWe ordered a ""cheese"" board and portions were skimpy and it was overpriced. So then we tried a flat bread that we imagined would come out warm and it was room temp close to being chilled. The menu should indicate this is not a warm/hot appetizer.  When we asked the waiter if the flat bread should be warm he took it away to \'ask\' someone.  The manager came over to our table to explain and agree the temp of this app should be stated on the menu.  No kidding!!!  Maybe something should have been offered in a response to the confusion.\nWe ended our meal with the pork chop dish which we shared.  The pork chop was dry  although the potatoes with it were yummy! $25 potatoes are out of my budget!\n\nWe decided not to ever return although we like and have had many good experiences in downtown Chandler  this was definitely not one!', ""I found this place to be overpriced  especially the food. The appetizers we got were not worth the money  especially when it came to the portions.  If I do come back  I'll make sure to eat before I go! But I think this would be a good place to go when the weather is nice  since the back patio looks relaxing. If it weren't for that  I'm not sure I would return."", ""It seems to be a constant challenge to find a bar and restaurant in the east valley that is not only NOT a chain but that also has a great atmosphere  an attentive wait staff  a fabulous wine list  and a unique food selection (without being too out of the ordinary).   Vintage 95 has all of these!  Not to mention how refreshing it was to deal with a hostess  Jocelyn   that wasn't 16 years old and actually knew what she was doing!  When we were seated our waitress  Emily was friendly  knowledgeable  attentive   and never rushed us.  The wine list is extensive  however  I think they should add more low range wines in the $25-$35 range to their list.   The warm and cozy decor of the place makes you want to stay and eat and drink for hours.  The outdoor patio in the back has a great fire pit and romantic lighting.  I HIGHLY suggest making a reservation or you could be waiting a long time for a table.  There was a problem with one of our entrees and the manager took care of it immediately.  I look forward to my next visit to Vintage 95."", 'Hand down one of only two places in Chandler that I would put on par with some of the best I have been to almost anywhere. \n\nEnjoy.', ""I am not sure if we just really had a bad experience or if other reviewers are totally crazy.\n\nAfter reading all the great reviews about Vintage 95 we (myself  the hubby and two other couples) decided to venture here.\n\nThings we did like:\n The patio is super cute and quaint.  We had some great weather and our server Eric was fantastic.  Plus they had one of my favorite wines-Dr. Loosen Reisling.\n\nNow on to the bad.\n\nWe tried the bruschetta which according to many reviews was top notch.  We only tried the goat cheese and bacon jam (out of curosity) and the mozzarella with grape tomatoes.  Eric really talked up the bacon jam making it seem like it would be the most amazing thing I've ever tasted.  It was the complete opposite.  It was very underwhelming and loaded with salt.  \n\nI had the ahi tuna dish which was pretty good but again-loaded with salt.  I felt so dehydrated the next day from all the salt I had!\n\nMy hubby ordered a burger which came over cooked.  He returned it to the kitchen and they corrected it.\n\nBut this is the really bad.\n\n3 of our friends ordered the stuffed poblano.  It sounded like it would be delish.  One of my friends said that hers was cold inside.  Like flat out cold.  Gross.  Then her hubby and our other friend that ordered it said the same thing.  We informed Eric who returned them to the kitchen.  The manager came out to offer his apology and informed them that it would be 5-6 minutes for them to return.  15 minutes later they did.  The EXACT same dishes  not reheated but simply piled with new sauce AND when they brought them back to the table they had no idea who's plate was who's.  The gal that brought them back just set them down like they were brand new dishes-totally ignoring the fact that one of them had been cut into pieces!  SO TACKY.\n\nNeedless to say everyone was totally disgusted at that point.  We once again told Eric and he was more then apologetic.  I felt really bad for him actually.  And once again we received a visit from the manager.  He whisked the dishes away and promptly took an order for some salads for them.  Which they actually liked.  \n\nI really tried to give this place 2 stars. I mean in the end the service we received was exceptional.  The manager was more then gracious about the situation and rectified the problem  I just can't do it though. \n\nWe will not be back.\n\nOk so after I posted my original review I received the absolute most sincere email from the manager Gavin.  Because of this email I changed my review to two stars and all of us that attended the other night said we would be willing to give it another shot (maybe not order food) because of his email. Plus they did have a great atmosphere on the patio and a great wine list :) I have had bad experiences before and have voiced my opinion but I have never had a manager take the time to review my posted comments and contact me.  So you know never know...maybe we will be back and fingers-crossed our experience will be much better."", ""A group of us had dinner on the back patio on a quiet Wednesday night.  It certainly is large and pretty with the two big fire pits but you can't be satisfied with ambiance alone  especially when you're hungry.  To start with our table shared the baked brie and a variety of the bruschettas   The brie was nice (I liked the presentation of grilled squash with it) and the bruschettas were also pretty tasty except for the pistachio date one.  That was horribly sweet and kind of gross.  After the appetizers the meal kind of went downhill.  The tomato bisque was too smoky in flavor and was left untouched by most of us.  The kale salad I ordered was tough and inedible and the flatbread I got as a replacement was tasteless and bland. I did like my rose and our server was very patient and pleasant.  But with such subpar food  good wine in a nice setting wasn't enough. The table next to us had the right idea  they ate elsewhere and came here for a nightcap."", 'My Fiancé and I dined here last night and had great time!  \n\nThe service was fantastic!  I especially want to thank the host who called and confirmed my reservation and after telling her that it was our first time dining here she reserved a table by the fire.  It is a great historic location and I enjoyed learning about the history from our server.\n\nI am always in search of the perfect Manhattan so we started off with the Mainstay Manhattan  It was a great blend and I enjoyed the fact that it was served up.  We started off with the artisan board  which was a little smaller then I was expecting  however I enjoyed how they let you pick your meat and cheese from a wide selection.  Next  we shared a BLT with light raspberry vinaigrette.  We also shared the short rib braised in a mole sauce which was fantastic  the sauce had great flavors and the meat was very tender.  Our server split both of the entrees without us asking which was appreciated.  As the name states  they have an extensive wine list we tried a bottle that came recommended and it did not disappoint - Random Ridge.  \n\nI look forward to going back here when I am in the area.', 'This was a great experience for my wife and I last night! We had a groupon discount for a 3 course meal and it proved to be an excellent purchase.  Our waiter Axel was superb! He literally came to our table more than seven times to make sure we were being serviced  and or satisfied.  I\'ll definitely ask for him on our next visit. Our first course was the Gem Salad.  It was excellent! However  it could be listed as a desert salad  with its sugary ingredients (I\'m a diabetic). No complaints though (we cleaned our plate). Our second course (we shared) was the smoke pork belly. It was excellent! We definitely recommend this as your second course! We ended up competing for the last bite! My wife had the salmon and rice for her entrée and I had the short rib/chuck burger with mixed fries. Both was excellent.  Both were paired with wine (we\'re not drinkers) and it was tasty.  Warning  you need an appetite to down their 3 course meal! I could have given this restaurant a 5 star review  but  there was a longer than expected delay between the ""courses"". When I mentioned this to wife  she reminded me that we were not at a ""Denny\'s"". We recommend that you try Vintage 95 for a great experience.  Ask for Axel as your waiter.  I think the waiter plays an important part in your experience!', ""After writing my last review and then ultimately returning to Vintage 95  I was beyond impressed by the level of customer service we received.  I can't be sure if they saw my last review or not but who cares  what mattered was that they remembered who we were and they came over and personally apologized for what happened to our bikes outside of their establishment and bought our first round of drinks.  It really meant a lot that they remembered who we were and took the time to acknowledge that shitty situation.  We left smiling and impressed and will definitely continue to frequent Vintage 95.

The waitress gave excellent recommendations  and we weren't disappointed in the slightest. The live music was phenomenal...the artist had the most intriguing and distinctive voice.

BUT we said 'make it spicy'.  Of course the waitress asked how spicy  like a 4 or 5.  I wish I knew the hot/spice levels of each and every restaurant and how it corresponds to the number 4 or 5.  Ugh..  I do not understand that logic of saying a number to determine the spice level  especially when its a first time to the restaurant and especially when you feel like eating spicy.\nAnyways  we said 4  coz we wanted a nice spicy meal that night.  My Pad thai was looking delicious  it was a treat to the eyes  loved the presentation and all BUT it was super hot  I infact loved the first few bites because there is this underlying sweetness of the pad thai sauce but after a point my mouth and my eyes were both watering lol.  Pad thai was tasting really good but I would have enjoyed more if I had made a wise choice of spice level.\nChicken fried rice with extra vegetables was just as good  nothing extra ordinary or special.

I used to really like this place  but it seems to keep going downhill. \n\nI was never a fan of the ambience in the restaurant  so I almost always order takeout. The place is usually pretty quiet because it\'s always nearly empty  and the music they play is designed to put you to sleep or take you back a few decades  depending on the day. I always found the booths really uncomfortable too; the seats really lack support and the tables aren\'t wide enough. \n\nThe food is wildly inconsistent. I almost always order Pad Thai (yes I know I need to be more adventurous)  so I can tell you exactly how inconsistent it is. Some days it\'s amazing  and other days I\'ve been tempted to chuck it in the trash. Sometimes a ""spicy level"" 2 will burn your eyebrows off  and other times it\'s barely noticeable. Sometimes my takeout container is so full it\'s nearly popping open  other times it\'s not.

So can you imagine my utter disappointment when I had a dish that was bland. How in the world is pad kee mao bland?\n\nWhile there were plenty of bell peppers  I greatly disliked the addition of bamboo shoots that was soaked in a sauce that ruined the familiar smell of pad kee mao. It created a vinegar like smell that overpowered everything. The noodles were cut into strange bite size pieces  the texture wasn\'t soft  and the sauce was minimal. But what bothered me the most was the lack of spice! This was definitely not pad kee mao--not even close!\n\nPerhaps I got there on a bad night. Perhaps it was just an off day  but I left having eaten only a quarter of my food. \n\nI\'m a huge fan of Thai food because I always know what to expect. \n\nMa Thai II was definitely unexpected and not in the good away.', ""Nice clean bright place compare to other Thai restaurants.

The noodles for the Pad See Ew was not as soft as it should be  but tasted good the next day when I microwaved it. \n\nOverall  if you have a Thai craving in Concord  this is a good place to visit. \n\nFree parking in the lot and the prices are decent."", ""We just took a DoorDash delivery order from Mai Thai II.

I have shared the photos I took of it. I'm no physicist but it seems like the food was too hot for this plastic container and caused it to melt and fail.

It\'s always hot and juicy and you can actually taste the steak\'s flavor. I suggest getting it without the guac and beans (so that leaves you with the meat  pico de gallo  and cheese) because in my opinion  those 2 things weaken the flavor and order it ""dry"" (no sauce). \n\nThe burritos  regardless of which one you order  are an excellent size. They\'re always stuffed full with the perfect tortilla-filling ratio. A lot of other places tend to have the tortilla rolled to where you get nothing but tortilla itself when you bite into it half the time. Plus  their tortillas rock!

Even if you don\'t know what you want right away  they\'ll patiently wait until you are. The chips and salsa are self-serve. You can choose between 3 different salsas  but I always stick to the mild because the other 2 lack flavor in my opinion. The only problem I have with the salsa is that at times it\'s very watery. I remember I went once with a friend and the salsa was very watered down. We had to basically scrape our chips on the bottom of the salsa bowl to get any chunks of tomato. \n\nOverall  I\'ve always been fairly satisfied with each visit.

The rest of the food lacked something to be desired.   \nWe also discovered a hair in the chips  and then when my daughter got her food   she found a hair in it as well!  When we told the waitress about the hair   instead of refunding us for the meal   she gave us $10 in a gift card  which is worthless since we won\'t be eating there again.', 'Love  love  love this place. We are fortunate enough to live close by  but I would drive many miles to eat here if necessary. We are from New Mexico and are big Mexican food fans - particularly breakfast burritos (my husband) and enchilada sauce (me)  and at New Mexican Grill both are delicious. We actually buy a quart of the red and green sauce each time we eat there to take home and use during the rest of the week! I can never choose between the red and green  so I am always getting some of both to enjoy.\n\nThe staff is always friendly  the restaurant itself is simple but clean and they choose a different charity each month you can donate to at the counter - very cool in my opinion. It is well-priced and SO good. Just writing this makes me want to grab dinner there tonight. :) If you appreciate good chiles and sauce  you will love this place as much as we do.', ""If you want flavor this is the place to go.  It is the real deal.  I could eat this food every night.  Chili relleno's are to die for.  Tamales too.  Haven't had a bad meal yet.  Only draw back is a cold beer would complete the meal."", 'Great food but the only thing holding them back from a 5 star ranking is the process in which they take orders.  they only have one register and the people that go there tend to take their time figuring out what they want.  the line can build up quick and takes forever.  Worst part is when you order take out.  You literally stare at your bag sitting on the counter the whole time the idiots in front of you contemplate their order.  My recommendation is to have them add two registers and the problem would be solved', 'Had tacos 1 chicken 1 machaca the chicken was all white meat it was good. \nThe machaca was fantastic. \nGreen chilies sauce was hot but super good and worth the heat. \n\nChips and salsa are good.', ""Took a while to figure out where it was since they don't have a sign.

The food here isn't bad  and if you prefer Sonoran Mexican it probably fits the bill just fine.  For my taste  everything was way too bland  nowhere near spicy enough.  Granted  I've been spoiled by Los Dos Molinos  but regardless I expect to see some fire brought if I'm eating New Mex.  This place couldn't quite deliver."", 'The food is delicious!

So I finally tried it.   It's Across from fitness works hidden in corner (no sign).  I ordered 2 fish tacos with beans & rice $6 and chicken burrito with green sauce $6.  Free chips & salsa bar with amazingly fresh salsa. Chips were a little thick & hard & dry but salsa makes up for it.  Fish tacos were amazballs.  Fresh pico de gallo & avocado on top & even a lemon to squeeze.   Skip getting beans & rice-nothing spectacular.   The green sauce chicken burrito was ginormous & the chicken was cut small & peppery- just the way I like it.   I had one happy husband when I got home with it.  They also gave us chips & salsa to go.  You could easily feed a family of 4 for under $15 here.  My only complaint is the salads only have iceberg lettuce.  I also felt bad for the waitress running around.   I think they were understaffed & she looked stressed.   She was trying to manage 6 tables plus to-go orders.  So food took a little bit but it was nice to sit & eat free chips & dip & catch up with my 6-year-old daughter.  We will definitely be back!"", ""im on this chile relleno kick. they are so dang good  people. \n\nfirst of all  this place is a little difficult to find. they are next to Natalia's.

The food portions are very large  so we have started ordering off of the a la cart menu.  Everything seems to be made from scratch  and if you love tacos - be sure and try their machaca beef taco or their shredded chicken taco.   This location is very  very clean and you can tell management really cares about you as a customer.', ""I liked this place.  The menu kind of bugged me - in that they don't have anything above the cashier  merely copies of the menu taped to the counter next to the register.  But that has nothing to do with the food.  The chips and salsa were good  as was the fry bread / chimi that we tried.

Twice I've been here where I ordered the food and it took 45 minutes to get my scrambled egg combo.  They were not busy and only had one other 2-top table in front of me.

But instead give them to charity. If this was the employees choice it would be one thing  but it's the owners. When I tip it's because I appreciate the service and think my server deserves it. I just think that's a bad owner for you and does not encourage servers to do their best."", ""I decided on the green chile pork mixed w beans chimichanga  w red chile sauce. So good! The pork was small cubes  not too much beans. The sauce was perfect; flavorful and not overpowering. Came w small sides of beans and rice.

The green chile sauce was hot and not as flavorful as the red  but still very good. Finally  the grilled chicken soft tacos in corn tortillas. The chicken was diced small. Perfect. \n\nThe woman that rang me up was super nice and mentioned that my order was checked twice.  That made me feel good so I didn't have to do it myself.  \n\nI hope you give this place a try and I can't wait to get breakfast burritos on Sundays!\n\nUpdate: 1/4/13.  They no longer give generous portions of chips or hot sauce which is a bummer.  They don't even give you enough hot sauce for the number of items you order.

I am Hispanic  so I am critical of Mexican food  but still  don't tease me Yelp!!"", ""I love New Mexican Grill.  They have the best carne asada around (in my opinion).  I have ordered many things and all have been delicious:\n\nThe carne asada is delicious.  I regularly order the carne asada burrito  which comes with beans  guacamole and pico de gallo inside  but the good news is  those extra ingredients aren't so overwhelming that you are left wondering where's the beef?!  We have also ordered the carne asada street tacos (YUM!) and carne asada quesadilla  also delicious.\n\nThe chicken is very flavorful too.  Have ordered the chicken quesadilla kids meal  it was HUGE and my son (who eats more than any adult I know  didn't even finish it-although that may be due to the fact he enjoyed the chips and salsa bar a little too much).\n\nThe green chile pork is so good as well.  It's moist and tender and the green chile definitely has a kick to it  helps get those seasonal allergies moving! \n\nThey also make a wonderful chimichanga  which can sometimes be hard to find  even here in Phx.  I know this for a fact because my father who lives in Florida  comes out to visit once a year and we *have* to go to 4-5 Mexican restaurants each visit in search of the perfect chimi.  Now I wouldn't trust his Floridian taste buds  but I make it a point to sample each myself for quality assurance purposes.  We have gone to fancy places  sit down places  casual places  hole in the wall places and this one  so far  has the most flavor machaca and perfectly deep fried tortilla.\n\nFinally  they have a great little chips and salsa bar where you help yourself.  They make 3 types of salsa  regular  hot and a green jalapeno.  I mix all three into a perfect little salsa trifecta.  Their guacamole is excellent too.  As for the rice and beans  I have had both and they were tasty too.  \n\nIn conclusion  the prices are good  the food is excellent  the portions are big and I always love supporting local business!"", 'This review is solely about their \'Navajo\' taco.. aka ""Indian Fry Bread"".  I\'ve only had this dish (carne asada) here and probably will stick to ordering this as it is plentiful  tasty  and repeatedly enjoyable.\nMy sis ordered their pork \'fry bread\' and I was disappointed because I asked the chef guy if it was shredded and he said yes (me thinks he don\'t know what he be takin\' bout) ... it was cubed and not as flavorful as my carne asada.. mine was delish!\nThe young girl at the front was nice and their place seems really clean and since it\'s finally a locally owned restaurant that *doesn\'t* suck in S Chandler (everything around here is a chain)  I am officially a FAN :)']"

The former was fairly straightforward  the latter had a distinctive flavor different than other jerk recipes; it's not too hot for those unacquainted with Caribbean food to try.

The husband and wife combo who run the place are very nice."", ""We were in the mood for something different and decided to have Jamaican food at Impressionz.  My beau had the brown stew chicken which was very flavorful and NOT spicy :)  I had the curry chicken which had a little kick but was tolerable for me.  We also ordered beef patties which were also very good!  The cabbage and rice were yummay!   The portions were a nice size ( I shared my plate with my 9 y.o. son because I wasn't sure if he would like it enough to have his own plate) and we all left feeling satisfied.  The offer bottled drinks which would be my only complaint....very sugary options but that's not really uncommon in most restaurants. \n\nCecilia's service  as others have described  is great!  She made us feel welcomed  answered all of our questions about the food and even gave us a little intervention when she overheard us talking to our son about his behavior.

Its all amazing!', ""Come for the food  stay for the people  and leave feeling full in heart and body. I picked this place on a whim to meet a friend for lunch  and I'm so very glad I did. I ordered the oxtail  which I've never tried before  and my friend ordered the jerk chicken. We both got the small sizes and still had enough to share so that we both had a chance to taste each dish. I loved the oxtail - tender and perfectly seasoned  and the jerk chicken was spicy but not painful - my friend noted that it was that perfect point of spiciness where you still taste all the flavors. The meal came with rice  fried plantains  and steamed cabbage - very home style  which fit the surroundings - bright  clean  and cheerful - as my friend mentioned to Cecilia  it felt like we were sitting and chatting in her kitchen. Not to be missed - definitely on my list of places that are what I love about Pittsburgh."", ""If you've been missing Jamaican food  prepared perfectly  this is the place. Cecilia is a lovely person  you will feel welcome in her place.\n\nThe curry goat was as good as it gets. If you love goat  you'll love this curry.

Unctuous  flavorful  delicious!"", ""Preparing for our Jamaican vacation in the coming weeks we decided to visit Impressionz.  I have to believe we will be hard pressed to find any place in Negril with a more authentically delicious Jerk. The food was fantastic and made for a spice lover.  Your taste buds will thank you while they scream from the heat in hopes of a cooling red stripe. Too bad they don't have drinks.  We will be back."", ""The experience was certainly a memorable one. As others have mentioned  Cecilia goes out of her way to provide personalized service and get to know you. She even introduced me to her husband when he came out with my order. The friendliness here is a major reason that I will be coming back to this place.\n\nFood was quite good as well. I had the small curry goat  but it was anything but small. Came with lots of meat and some side vegetables  and it was very obvious that the curry was infused with lots of herbs and spices--definitely had a great kick to it. The only slight modification I would've liked is probably a bit less sauce--other than that though  it was delicious. Can't wait to try other things like the jerk chicken or oxtail next time."", 'Cecilia is the best. You are missing out if you have the chance to grab a bite here and go to a chain restaurant.

Frankly I was not interested in driving to East Liberty for lunch  even though it is only 5  minutes from where I work.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The food was really good and the atmosphere lovely.  Cecelia came over and introduced herself.  She was so warm and welcoming.  I was glad we supported this family owned restaurant and the food was great.  I had the jerked chicken.  It was spicy but perfect!  I will surely go back.', 'HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!! I have had my fair share of Jamaican food this place is the epitome of bland  lackluster food. It deserves no stars the brown stew chicken taste as if it was boiled in a pot of vinegar. I refuse to discuss how horrible the oxtails were  your better off going to Mama Rose or Leon they blow this place out of the box.', ""I only tried the Jerk Chicken  but it was extremely salty and there wasn't much flavor to it. I don't know if the other dishes are better  but I was disappointed with the portions as well."", ""I had been wanting to try Impressionz for a long while  since it fits the profile of my favorite type of ethnic restaurant--a little-known hole in the wall with great food.  I finally received the opportunity to do so this Sat. evening  since I needed to make a Target run.  Since CM was shuttling me over and was hungry for dinner  I suggested it  and after parking in the garage  we headed a block or two over to check it out.\n\nAlthough I'd never had Jamaican cuisine before  I did some research on Wikipedia beforehand and learned that salt fish and ackee was a traditional dish.  Since I didn't know how spicy the jerk chicken would be  and I wanted to try a more unique dish  I had to order it when I saw it on the MTO section of the menu ($18).  CM  on the other hand  decided to stick to what he knows and went with the small jerk chicken ($10.50).  While we were waiting for our entrees  CM ordered a beef patty ($2.50)  and I ordered a bottle of Ting grapefruit soda.  Although I don't eat beef  I decided to break my rule for a split second and ate a corner with a tiny bit of the filling.  The pastry was quite flaky  and the filling was well seasoned  which helped to mask the flavor of the beef.  CM assured me that the rest was quite tasty.\n\nDespite being told that MTO entrees take 20 min. to make  my entree seemed to come out faster than expected (in about 15 min.  I believe  though I wasn't timing it)  and CM's was brought out immediately afterward.  My entree was more savory than I would have guessed  and had just the right amount of fishiness.  The ratios of ingredients seemed well-balanced  and it was huge--so much so that the sides of rice  cabbage  and plantains came on an additional plate (see photo).  Though it came on a single plate with sides  CM's jerk chicken  which consisted of a quarter dark meat  was also portioned generously.  Between the large portion and the spiciness of the jerk sauce  he took half home for later enjoyment  along with some of the left over sides.\n\nAs others have mentioned  the only part of our experience that bested the food was the service from Cecilia and her family.  Cecilia is very personable  and was very good about answering our questions about the menu.  Her daughters were there as well  and were adorable.  We could tell that Impressionz attracts regular customers  probably from the local neighborhood  by the rapport that they had with Cecilia.\n\nThe quality and amount of food  as well as the caliber of service  at Impressionz lived up to the hype  and then some.  (CM agreed  saying it was better than a Jamaican restaurant he frequented in Ann Arbor.)  However  I'm not awarding a full 5 stars because (1) I felt the MTO dishes were a bit overpriced  esp. for a cash only place (even in light of the portion size) and (2) I think I would have enjoyed a different dish more (though this was my fault for choosing it...) The only other major downside was that the bathroom's currently out of service due to a flood that occurred in Mar. Nevertheless  I highly recommend checking out this neighborhood jewel! 4.5 stars."", ""I went here with a few friends including one from Jamaica.  She's been looking for a place where she could get some authentic food  and we found it. \n\nThe food was great.  We ordered jerk chicken  oxtail  curry chicken  and curry goat.  Everything was delicious.\n\nCecilia was my favorite part.  She is such a warm genuine person.  It was refreshing  and I can't wait to go back again."", ""I just had a beautiful trip down memory lane. Delicious peppery curried goat  rice and peas  stewed cabbage and early 90's dancehall Reggae on the sound system.

I haven't tried anything else on the menu  but I'll be back."", 'Authentic Jamaican food in Pittsburgh  me and my husband were thrilled. I wish I had known this place years ago. We ordered beef patties  jerk chicken  brown stewed chicken. Portions are generous.The food is incredible  I was so upset because I was full  wanted to try the fish (Oh well  surely there will be a next time). Cecilia and her husband are the owners. We got the chance to talk with her and I just need to say this  the world is a better place with people like her in it. Cecilia  you are a treasure! Impressionz is a secret gem.', ""This place has AMAZING food  and all of the employees are simply delightful. Don't be fooled by the fact that it looks like a hole-in-the-wall from the outside. Cecelia  the owner  was super attentive and had our names memorized after we said them once. I had the jerk chicken (small) which was huge and delicious. It comes with cabbage  rice and beans  and two big slices of plantain. My vegan friend had the rice and beans with the jerk sauce. They also have a vegetable medley that we didn't try this time  and are more than happy to serve any kind of veggie you like in a curry or with jerk sauce. There's plenty more for a vegan or vegetarian to eat than you would think from reading the menu.\n\nYou should definitely try this place out!"", 'Returned on June 19 with friends from Arizona  and they were thrilled by Impressionz. This time I tried the curried chicken  which I loved. And the side of cabbage was delicious. As we left the owner came over. Not only did she remember us from last time but she even remembered what dishes we ordered! Love this place.', ""The large Curry Chicken plate is great! The rice and beans soak up the curry juices and taste wonderful. And the cabbage and carrots are a nice light delight. I'll be back soon!"", ""This place is the definition of a hole in the wall. With that being said  expect to be embraced with exceptional above and beyond service and the feeling that you've just been accepted into the family!\n\nCecelia  the owner  is so joyful and goes out of her way to learn your name and address you by it throughout your visit. Basically  the atmosphere and staff earn this place a 5 star rating alone.\n\nThen comes the food... the food is a whole other story. Talk about an incredible food explosion in your mouth! Seriously  I didn't know that Jamaican was my favorite food. The meat is slow cooked and tender  with delicious spices and seasonings that will make you already plan your next trip before you finish your dish. I had the jerk chicken and my fiance has the brown stewed chicken. Both were served with sides of rice and beans  cabbage  and plantains. Seriously  amazing including a ton of food (despite being the small portion) for only $10.75 each!\n\nWe will definitely be back for the amazing food and incredible hospitality."", ""Last night three of us finally ate at this hidden gem in East Liberty.  Two of us had the spicy jerk chicken--which we loved. One had a less spicy beef dinner and liked that as well. In fact  we liked everything about Impressionz: food  décor  background music and being treated like special guests. Remember that it's BYOB and cash only. When you go you might see the three of us because we intend to go back. Often."", ""This is my 3rd time ordering the jerk chicken($11?) .  It's so good. It is spicy  it's bold and dark and falling off the bone. The plantains are even softer and sweeter this time around. The rice and bean soaks up the black sauce from the jerk chicken and the cabbage tempers the heat. While I'm eating people go in and out ordering the meat pies. People tell me the beef pie is really good and makes a great filling snack($2.50 each)   I'm going to try that next time. I've also had the oxtail and goat and those are less spicy but also very flavorful. They're about the same price as the jerk chicken. They give you a decent sized plate -- for me I always have leftovers.\n\nThe place isn't fancy but don't let that fool you -- best food in East Liberty. Place is easy to miss but it's actually right around the corner at Highland and Broad  between Boost Mobile phone place and a barber."", ""Not very vegetarian friendly  but friendly nonetheless. \n\nWe tried the only veggie entree we saw on the menu and it was pretty good - with lots of yummy beans and fresh vegetables including some delicious variety of squash and corn on the cob. We thought it looked overly expensive on the menu ($14 entree in a sorta hole in the wall type of place)  but the portion size ended up being big enough to feed a family of four. It came with rice and peas  sauteed cabbage and plantains. I was a little afraid of the sauce because I could not identify its contents  but I have picky dietary quirks. I would have liked some sort of scotch bonnet hot sauce to add to the dish  but they only had Red Hot - Wing style version  which is gross. \n\nI think meat eaters might love this place if they knew it existed. I have lived around the corner for years and only recently discovered it - it's hidden! They carry a good selection of sodas  made with real sugar  such as Ting. The couple who now own the place are extremely nice and their daughter is a wonderful dancer. Meeting them and their children was seriously heartwarming. \n\nFYI: Cash only.

We had the Ox Tail and Chicken Stir Fry.  The Ox Tail was extremely good  I'd never had it before and although the idea kinda tweaked with me a little I gave it a try and successfully ignored the weirdness factor until it was well established in my brain that I loved this dish! ;)  My wife got the chicken stir fry and loved it (I tried a small bite or two and confirm it was very good.)  We also got a special home-made Jamaican drink which I can't pronounce (but it was good) and a slice of rum cake to-go (my **favorite** of all the cakes!)

When I asked the cashier who took my order to have it changed to the promo they were running  I was told that it was too late since they already started making the pizza and it was paid for.\n\nI couldn\'t make sense of what he just told me. They only started spreading the sauce and cheese on the pizza when I wanted to change my order.  ""How come you didn\'t tell me about this promotion?""\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders and told me he could offer me some free dipping sauce. Are you kidding!?  The savings on the promo was much more than the cost of the dipping sauce he was offering! I was busy running other errands in the area  so I didn\'t really have the time to give this guy a piece of my mind.  All in all  the pizza was good  but the customer service NEEDS A LOT of improvement.  If this is the treatment towards all customers  this location deserves to be closed. Permanently.', ""Same food as any other Domino's but ridiculously uncoordinated. The kitchen floor is pure chaos and they spent more time trying to figure out who ordered what and arguing about pending orders than they do actually making food. There will often be someone out on the sidewalk advertising cheap pizza but don't trust any time estimates given by the staff if you walk in in person; add at least 10-20 more minutes.""]"

She suggested me to get roasted pork belly benedict. Korean boiled eggs caught my eye so I decided to try that also. She said Dr. Tran always order Korean boiled eggs when he\'s here and it\'s delicious. My food came out in 25 to 30 min but it was nice that they give complementary chips and salsa. \n\nRoasted pork belly benidict... Delicious! Poached eggs were perfectly made. Roasted pork belly was exactly like ""Char siu"" you would get in some Ramen shop. Very fatty and melt in your mouths. I was expecting to get muffin type bread but the bread was like french baguette toasted very hard. I couldn\'t cut with the knife so I had to pick it up with my fingers and ate it. \n\nKorean boiled eggs... When I saw ""Korean eggs"" on the menu  I thought of ""Korean sauna eggs"" which you would get in Korean spas (they roast eggs in hot sauna for hours) but completely different thing came out. It was exactly like ""Nitamago"" or ""Ajitama"" you would get in any nicer Ramen shop. Perfectly done sweet soy sauce flavored Nitamago. I loved it!\n\nIt was nice for the chef to come out and talk to every customer that was there. He was a very nice person. He explained me how to make perfect Nitamago (well  Korean boiled eggs) with vinegar and stuff. I don\'t know if he\'s a owner chef or head chef but I hope this place gets a lot of business!!', ""Holy Crap! This place just blew our minds this morning...hubby and I came in a little after 9am because other places we drove by were just stupid packed and we wanted to sit somewhere comfortable and low key with good food. I've been eyeing this place for a while now and what a perfect time to try them out. We sat by the window  we had a new waitress but she did great with timely service and great interaction. They serve chips with a yummy banana nutella spread while you wait for your meals.  We ordered tosilog for the hubby  green eggs and spam for me and shortstacks to share. The meals were delicious and hit the spot for us...we were so into our dishes that we didn't even get a chance to dig into the shortstacks - we ended up taking them home for a later splurge. I was a little bummed that they upped the prices by a couple dollars from what is listed on their website (someone needs to UPDATE that stat)  but in the end it was still worth it. Eggs were cooked perfectly for both meals  the green thai butter used on mine gives it a nice kick of flavor and spice. Spam pieces were fried just right  not underdone (yes  this is possible) and not overdone. The tocino was marinated pork belly - again  great flavor and texture.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the little details incorporated into each dish...garnishing was spectacular! The chef even came by our table to check on how everything turned out - that was a very nice touch...From other reviews  it looks like kitchen efficiency can be a hit or miss I guess depending on when you get there - glad we got there when we did  because when we left  the crowd certainly picked up and it appears that the kitchen got backed up from what another review states of their experience from today as well - I remember seeing that couple come in with their baby  it's too bad they didn't get a spectacular experience.  Hubby was greatly impressed with this place and that says a lot as it's very hard to please him. We are fans!"", ""The food is MEDIOCRE. I usually don't do Yelp reviews  but I feel like I was robbed... I had the Pupusa plate - Salvadorian/Mexican plate. First of all  as I smelled the plate I thought this smells like microwave and old...hmm maybe not too many people order this plate. Second  I thought the menu said potatoes and bread- nope didn't happen. Third  overpriced. Fourth  the food 100% didn't taste fresh - smell  taste  texture  you named it it WASN'T fresh. Fifth  I ended up in the bathroom. Sadly to say  try another place for exquisite food. I hate to do bad reviews on small businesses....However  something has to change read and pay attention to the YELP reviews. I didn't bother complaining because of the other reviews  sounds like the staff/owner do not take too well on reading/hearing criticism or simply from a PAYING customer. Good luck."", 'I found this place here on Yelp and saw really good reviews. So  we decided to go try them. This restaurant is cute and little. Very well decorated and the hostess/waitress (wife of the chef) she was very nice and helpful. I got the bread pudding fruit French toast  very delicious! And also very filling lol  I took home half. My husband got the burger with tots. He was very happy with his good :) we also saw the chef so it was pretty cool to see him communicating with his guests. We will back :)', ""Hello Matthew \n You are correct  when you came by our table we did tell you things were fine. If you would have checked with your staff you would have been informed that I did complain to the server that the bacon tempura was not good prior to you coming to our table. I would have thought that he would have informed you as the place wasn't to busy. We did hear him tell the kitchen staff about it. Plus if you had looked at our plates when you came to the table  I would have thought the pile of batter on the plate would have been a clue? If you didn't see it then you surly saw it when it was cleared from the table. I didn't fell it necessary to complain twice  your staff should have informed you  that is just my opinion on that. The other thing was the server did ask about a replacement  I declined. I also paid the bill in full without any compensation for an un happy customer. \nAs for you being a small busy  I am trying to do my part for you. Our first meal there was great! This is an opportunity for you to hear from your customers and maybe take a look at things that need to be tweaked or changed. \nI wish you well.\nThis is what Yelp is for to inform and hopefully help."", 'We came for breakfast and the food is so good that we wud love to come back again in this short  period of time we have during this trip. Highly recommend the food. Looking Forward to another trip here again.', 'Brunch is my favorite thing to do on the weekends. We came here based on yelp reviews eventhough when I looked it up the photos on yelp did not look that spectacular for me to be excited about visiting at least in my own visual perspective. \n\nFor a Sunday this place is empty. Okay it could be some factors but for a Sunday it\'s a bit odd for it to be just us (1 table) This is my first time to be ""the only table"" to be served  so I guess I expect to be served well  granted we are the only table. I can\'t complain about the service since it\'s only us.  It\'ll be weird if I have to wait 30 mins for a dish. We tried the grilled pork belly benedict and french toast. For the Pork Belly Benedict  it was just alright nothing that would want me to come back & try it again. The meat and fat ratio is more towards the pork fat and the potatoes are extremely dry  bland and cold. As for the French Toast I like the crunchiness but nothing epic. The presentation looks different from other yelp photos. I guess it depends on what fruit toppings they have available. I wasn\'t asked for any choices  they just came out with blueberries. Overall the food is just okay  like I said nothing that would want me to come back.\n\nThis is my first Sunday Brunch that I felt I didn\'t enjoy my whole brunch experience at all. I think the food is a bit over priced too. I don\'t mind spending my hard earned cash for good food but I also expect  a total good experience in trying out your restaurant. I really hope SERVE could thrive in the brunch scene.  The potential is there but just not today.', ""the food i had today was just ok. I liked the taste of my food and the way it made me feel as though i was in peru. But i felt that the portion size was too much and somehow overwhelming in flavor. But i also felt that my service was just ok. I love that the chef came out to see how it was  but the waitress who is new (i'll give her that) added on things we didnt ask for (which she did fix i appreciated) but she just gave my friend sweet potatoes without asking her what she wanted as a side  and her burger was practically raw. I think its a great concept nice place but they need to clean a few things up... oh and my water had black things floating in it twice even after i asked for a new one."", ""Served is a real Henderson gem.\n\nI've been here twice now and both visits have featured food that was fabulous.  Both times I had the Ono Wings with rice because that dish is just delicious.  I am not really a wing woman  but I just love the seasoning they use  maybe soy?  I recommend this dish for yourself or to share if you're feeling generous.  My second visit was with the boyfriend for breakfast and I had the Longsilog (Filipino) breakfast  which was just like eating at my parents' house.  This dish features longanisa  garlic fried rice  and fried eggs  all of which are  regular features in Filipino households  or at least they are in ours  my aunts' and uncles'  and cousins' kitchens.  Longanisa is a Filipino sausage that's on the sweeter side and is usually eaten with rice. Heck  most Filipino food is eaten with rice.  Although Served is not a Filipino restaurant per se  there is definitely a Filipino influence due to one of the chefs being married to a Filipina: he's a smart man.  I really loved this breakfast and of course I'm probably biased since it just brought back all the warm memories of home and Mom and Lola's cooking.  \n\nThe staff here is very welcoming and attentive and the overall experiences I've had here just make me want to return again and again.  Next on my list to try are the longanisa tacos  the Mac and Cheese of the Day  and the Miso Pork Belly Burger."", ""Today was my first time eating at Served.   I had the pleasure to meet the Chef/Owner.   Chef Matthew is doing some crazy good things with this inventive menu!   I had the Roasted Pork Belly Bahn Mi and it was one of the best I've had.

The hostess/waitress was really nice and upbeat but she didnt know the menu...she kept looking at our menu to write things down and everything we asked about she had to go back to ask the kitchen. Ordered a beer had to ask 3 times for it and when she brought it over it was wrong. My water had a few things floating in it. My knife was dirty. She came by to refill water and only refilled 1 glass and walked away while the other 2 were close to empty. Our appetizer came out after our main course. I had to get out of there.

I was looking for a place to eat and I found this place on what other place then Yelp! \n\nThere's plenty of parking at this location and it was packed at all when we went around 12p.

To me  that means a lot for a chef to come out of the Kitchen. \n\nThe pricing ranges from $9 to about $25. The food is amazing here. I ordered the burger with pork belly on top with potatoes and it was ONO! I had to cut it in half or it was too big for me to eat.

Expectations were high from me coming in due to the great reviews about this place. We left this place feeling uncomfortable  uneasy  & heavy  not in a full stomach way. Heavy as in energy-wise. The energy in this place is really  really low. It did not give us a good dining experience. I truly wanted to give this place a great review but i just could not. I will give credit when credit is due & based on my history of reviews  I will also fairly give a negative review when it\'s due. \nOur server Cassandra was an exception. She was sweet  nice  & patient with this patron especially after I told her that it\'s our first time in their establishment. \nThere were two people  Jaimie and Phil who approached our table  well  Jamie just kind of talked to us in passing  & each of them explained why it was so slow. We were the only people who were there at the time (see video) & there were two older couple who was there when arrived. They said it was because of the ""It\'s a beautiful life"" event that may be causing the slow turns and that the young people who frequent their establishment are all still asleep with hang overs  either way  we did not care why they were slow. It just felt like there was so much explanation being made to justify why we were the only patrons there. IT REALLY WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. Not to mention just how eerily quiet it was in there. Talking in low voices seemed like the whole place could hear our conversation. \nThe food  however  was good. We ordered and shared the Pork belly benedict and the crispy blueberry french toast and the flavors of these dishes were good. But sometimes good food coupled by a negative familiarity do not make for a stellar experience. \nI TRULY HOPE THAT THEY WILL ONLY IMPROVE AND GET BUSIER BECAUSE ""SERVE"" HAS SO MUCH POTENTIAL.', 'We found this place from reading Yelp.

I enjoy a cappuccino with breakfast and brunch.\n\nSecond visit  about 4 months later: the food has noticeably changed from our memories. Bigger portions and greasier  heavier food. Not sure if the cooking staff turned over or what but we felt the quality had diminished and we likely won't be going back a third time."", ""Everything on the menu is overpriced. $16 for French toast and $20 for Salmon Benedict you're better off on going to a regular diner like Baby Stacks where there are no frills and items are reasonably priced .

We were waiting for awhile for more water. \nBut other than that  the food was amazing. I'm Filipino and I'm not a big fan of Filipino food. But what I liked about this place was the mixture.

She also filled our water frequently (very important to me!)\n\nFood: I got the Asian BLAT which has pork belly. This sandwich was bomb! I could have eating it without the pork belly and it will still be bomb. Whatever dressing they used was delicious. The pork belly was really nicely marinated but fatty (I love it but if you don't like a giant junk of fat  maybe not). The problem for me was the pork belly was so big that I couldn't actually eat it in the sandwich. I took it out of the sandwich and cut it up and ate it in between sandwich bites. It came with potatoes which was good but I didn't really care for it. My friend got the green egg and spam with garlic rice. I didn't try it but the garlic rice smelled delicious!\n\nPrice: A bit on the pricy end in my opinion. I think 12 for my sandwich was decent especially because of the big pork belly. Spam and eggs are cheap so I couldn't justify paying 11 for green eggs and spam even with garlic fried rice. \n\nAmbiance: We went during a quiet time so the place was pretty empty.

We plan on making this restaurant a stop each time we visit Las Vegas.', 'Great food... The fusion of flavors  and made from scratch entrees are remarkable. Not to mention their occasional specialty menu the Chef Matt puts together is off the chart  especially his scotch egg encased in longanisa...delicious... soft shell crab Benedict... beef hash Benedict with home made bread pudding...

Savour the presentation before experiencing a harmony of tastes that melt in your mouth. Your tastebuds will dance in rapture with each forkful.', 'What a fabulous local place.

The chef is usually on site fixing your meal and I have never had to wait for a seat. I will be returning over and over to eat here.', ""The food was so great we wished we could of eaten every meal here  but don't have 4 stomachs. Excellent selection. Chef Matt/Joe added so much uniqueness to each and every meal. French Toast is right up there on top! So good. The turkey sandwich was so moist and awesome. It had a great taste because Chef brines the whole bird. You can't go wrong eating here. The fried potatoes (formally baked potatoes) were so crispy and light. Service was from Jamie took great care of us. Oh one other thing the coffee and the beans they used to make it was better than any coffee I have ever had. If I could give 6 stars I would!"", 'After reading all the high ratings  I felt confident about having a great meal here. \nNormally I don\'t write too negative of reviews  because every meal can\'t be perfect every time.....\nBut I have to say  this place was disappointing. I\'m always willing to pay higher prices for exceptional food. This food was average at best. Nothing different than an average breakfast chain. \nOverpriced for underwhelming food. \nI ordered over easy eggs  and they came way over cooked. I was then up-sold a side item  which he ended up forgetting to give me. But he said  ""you won\'t get anything like this French toast anywhere"" wow! I was excited to try this French Toast winner. I\'ll just say  sigh  disappointing. \nThe service was confusing. With the high price point  you would expect good classy service  but this guy was  how should I say it  tacky  rude. Made the poor little girl at our table so uncomfortable with his ""just kidding jokes"". Made constant silly jokes  forgot a part of my meal  and when I asked about it  he made me feel like I was wrong. I basically had to argue to get this French toast  that he convinced me to try. This server blew it. When you pay $25-$30 for breakfast per person  your server should be attentive and kind. \nOur table left paying over $65 for an average breakfast and decided we will not be returning.', 'Favorite breakfast. Huge portions. Best blueberry pancakes. Baked berry French toast even better!', ""First time in yesterday. Super impressed! Inventive menu  generous portions  fabulous presentation  and decent prices. I ordered the BLAT sandwich with the sweet potato fries. Thick  delicious  smoky bacon (although it was sweet...fried in brown sugar maybe? Yummy  but not my preference). Two thumbs up on the sweet potato fries. Husband ordered a Korean sandwich and the truffle parm crispy potatoes. I didn't try his sandwich but he said it was great. The truffle potatoes were amazing but rich. Looking forward to coming back and trying many more meals!"", 'Awesome place for brunch  kinda bummed about the fact they are not serving dinner for me to try next time. Back to the review  what makes the review a five star is the service and of course the food. The chef always make sure all the food coming out of the kitchen is enjoyed by their servers as he comes out of the kitchen to greet and check service. Very good thing for me as a foodie.... \nWe ordered the soft shell benedict  french toast  and a bunch of goody stuff and all is exceptional. This is my new go to place evrytime i get here in vegas. Will follow them when they start serving dinner....more power to the staff and crew of this establishment.', 'Very friendly staff  server was personable and chef came out to our table! Delicious food and FULL menu! I was nervous about the quantity and variety on the menu at first...I am sometimes under the impression of quality over quantity. However  everything that came out of the kitchen was delicious. \n\nI went in a group of three. As an appetizer  we got an order of the Lumpia Fillipino Eggrolls...Very tasty and served with a sweet chili sauce and vinegar mixture. Entrees--I ordered the pupusa...It was a perfect portion and was beautiful. A cheese pupusa with a nice helping of braised beef and a perfectly poached egg. Another ordered the kabocha curry--large portion but DELICIOUS. The crunchy  battered and fried kabocha squash paired nicely with the creamy curry sauce and rice. YUM. Lastly  the avocado pancakes were ordered. My two acquaintances really liked them...they tasted ""homemade"" (thank goodness right?! ha) and were very fluffy. However  I was unimpressed...seemed too standard. I was expecting something much more out of the box when the menu says ""Avocado pancakes"".\n\nThis is a great restaurant in an unfortunate location. Needs more foot traffic and more successful businesses around it.', ""Wow.  Rarely do you find a menu like this.  I wanted everything  finally settling on the BBQ burger.

There are a few fun looking menu options I need to explore and we will be back :)"", ""Served is a hidden gem in the Henderson area. It's in the middle of a plaza and the sign isn't flashy  so it can easily be passed on for Kitchen Table which is on the other side of the plaza and a popular place for brunch foods. It looks like they serve a variation of breakfast foods with some Filipino influences and some Japanese and Korean flavors added too  so it's like an Asian American breakfast type of place. When I went the carpets were really dingy  but based on recent pictures  it seems like they've re-floored the place so it should be much nicer now.\n\nI got the corned beef hash and the miso pork belly burger. Expect to get a box to go because the portions are massive and the foods are so heavy  you'll want to save it for a 2nd round. The pork belly was fatty and flavorful  I had a great time chewing into it and eating my burger piece by piece. The hash is really tasty  and tastes like your standard  salty hash  but I mixed it in with my burger and it was really fun to eat.\n\nThe service staff is nice and there was no wait when I came in to eat.

Just attentive and proper. \n\n\nWhat can be improved:\n\n1. Tocino was fatty  bit much for ethnic palette  so Western palette might get intimidated. But flavor was good over all. \n\n2. Plating of corned beef hash. While tasty needs some TLC. BUT still tasty. \n\n3. Restroom needs attention. \n\n4. Ambience. It's clean  but maybe some color.

Shocked we still decided to sit down and give the spot a try. A very nice hostess came over and took out order and dropped off some spiced chips and salsa. From the chips and salsa both my colleague and I both knew this was going to be a special lunch. We both couldn't stop eating the chips they were that delicious. \n\nFor entree my colleague ordered their club (against my advise) with sweet potato fries and I went with their BBQ Bacon Burger with potato wedges. His club was good but nothing special but my Burger my god was that delicious.

Sometimes I just crave fries with my burger."", ""My favorite brunch place in this area  hands down. It's tucked back into the corner of a business-type plaza  so the location is not obvious. I crave their breakfast hash and make special trips here just to order it. They also have some unique burger options. I have tried one of the burgers  but typically stick with the breakfast items. The last time I brunched here  the complimentary appetizer while we waited for our entrees was cinnamon pita chips with a banana Nutella dip. Oh man!

My friend ordered the shrimp tempura  po'boy and I got the corned beef Benedict which comes on an amazing rye bread pudding. Everything is excellent!  It was more than I'd normally spend on breakfast but i ended up taking half home so It sort of worked out.  I'd prefer an option for a smaller portion at a smaller price. I'm not a light eater but the bread pudding was just too dense! The only thing keeping this place from being a five star review is the price point and the out of the way location.

Extreme portions. Only thing Louise and I casually mentioned in the car to one another  as we headed back to the highway  was that the carpeted floor was kinda ""shot"". Not stinky  just past its ""best before date"". We both ALSO noticed that management was poring over flooring catalogs with floor installers while we leaving!!! So  no fault there...

Plenty of food - my husband was happy to get the leftovers! My mom got the green eggs and spam - the Thai butter was delicious and the spam was delightful!

Interesting menu with bold flavors  lots of options and great service. Will be back fo sho', ""I saw this restaurant featured on a local news program and since it was in the neighborhood decided to check it out. First it is difficult to find. It is located in the center of a medical office building center not visible from the street. The GPS said we had arrived so I pulled into the complex and there it was. Parking was adequate but the owner should work with the complex management to get a handicap parking space or two closer to his restaurant. The closest handicap parking spot was in front of a Chiropractor's office quite a distance away. Once inside I found it to be smaller than I expected. Maybe it could sit 30 people max. I did not understand the décor. I suppose it was supposed to be cozy. As for the food choices I have been based in both the Philippines and Hawaii and have traveled all over Asia so was familiar with the menu items although the Chef had his own style dishes. We started off the juice of the day and coffee. I must say this was one of the best coffees I have ever had. I asked our server  Linda  what kind of coffee they served and she said all she knew it was strong. I expected her to say she would ask but she didn't. We ordered our brunch items starting with the Roasted Pork Belly Benedict for me and the wife had the Filipino breakfast. There was a long wait for the food to come. After 15 minutes or so Linda brought some chips and salsa to hold us over while I had my second cup of the excellent coffee. Finally the meals came. The Filipino breakfast was just right with the eggs whites crispy right along the edge the way they are supposed to be. You don't see that detail at most other Filipino restaurants. The Longanisa (Filipino sausage) was just right for me  not too garlic strong as some Filipinos like it. Notably missing were the traditional tomato slices normally served with the typical Filipino Breakfast plate. I like to mix the tomato slices with the garlic fried rice. I found the Roasted Pork Belly Benedict somewhat lacking. They were a little skimpy on the pork belly and it was not crispy along the edges as I expected. Rather just a little mushy. As someone mentioned in another review the bread was hard. If you like this type of dish I would highly recommend the Kailua Pig Benedict at Babystacks. In fact I would recommend Babystacks way over Served for menu selections (many more selections) and taste for this type of food selections. Lastly we ordered the Berry Baked French Toast for a sort of desert and to take home for later after tasting. It was stated on the T.V. review takes two days to prepare this dish. It is made from bread pudding cut into squares and fried as French toast. To me it was a big disappointment. It was served on a long plate as small squares. But as you removed what was supposed to be slices of French toast they fell apart and what you got on your plate was a pile of bread pudding with berries. Again  Babystacks far exceeds Served for this type of dish. I would maybe return to try other menu selections but for now prefer Babystacks for more selections at a lower cost. Another overlooked spot for Filipino-Hawaiian dishes is Thelma's Filipino Foods in Henderson. More of a point-point fast food place but excellent authentic Filipino-Hawaiian dishes."", 'What a hidden gem!  Coming back from Boulder city we simply lucked out and found this place for lunch.

This may sound sweet  but it is not that sweet and the Nutella was whipped and very light. I had the Roasted Pork Belly Benedict. It was topped with a Thai Chili Hollandaise sauce that was slightly too spicy for my liking  but it was smooth and creamy and paired perfectly with the marinated roasted pork. There was a little too much fat on the pork belly that was not rendered enough  but the overall flavors of the pork was delicious. It paired perfectly with the sauce  where the sauce accentuated the natural flavors of the roasted pork. This was served on a bed of toasted sourdough crostini  where it soaked up the flavors of the pork and the sauce. There was not too much bread  which was good as it did not overpower the pork\n\nMy boyfriend got the Longsilog  which is a traditional Filipino breakfast of fried garlic rice  eggs  and longanisa  which is a Filipino breakfast sausage. They make their own longanisa and it was cooked to perfection  with a crispy outer shell  giving it that classic ""popping"" sound when the casing breaks. The sausage itself was slightly sweet and salty  though not overpoweringly sweet. It was accompanied with their own seasoned vinegar  which is a classic pairing with this type of sausage. The vinegar was not as strong as expected  which was great because a lot of times a strong vinegar can mask the flavors of the longanisa.

Super nonchalant and you could tell he didn\'t want to be there. I don\'t know about you guys but that definitely throws me off and puts a bad taste in my mouth before the food even gets there.

We shared an order or the sweet potato fries. I appreciate the fact that my dish came with a side of vinegar as a dipping sauce lol. I couldn\'t finish my food but everything was so good. The sweet potato fries were in a tempura batter or something  but they probably made it to my top 5 fries lol.

The inside decor wasn\'t too attractive and was a bit too dark. \n\nUpon entering  we had to wait a few minutes before the ""only waitress"" finished helping the other guests to get seated for a party of 5.

It was even more frustrating that a table or two got their food before us when we clearly got there first. Again  I totally don\'t blame her. The restaurant just needs to staff more waiters and waitresses at this place. She forgot things there and here  but I couldn\'t blame her. We got our free chips about 15 minutes after being seated. 10 tables to 1 waitress is insane.\n\nAs for the food --- oh boy! I loved it! I ordered the Bi Bim Ba. It was mhmmmm good! The meat was a slight tougher for my liking  but it was deliciously grilled and seasoned. I\'m interested in trying the Miso Belly Sandwich next.

Here's my advice  bring a bunch of people so everyone can sample different things.\nMy buddy and I ordered the Miso Pork Belly Burger and the Roasted Pork Belly Bahn Mi Sandwich.  Both were delicious and very flavorful.  I enjoyed my sandwich so much so that I decided to order the Shrimp Tempura Po'Boy Sandwich to go.  Again  amazing flavors.

Both unique and tasty!  The sandwich is set apart with the flavorful pork belly and miso vinaigrette arugula.  I chose it to be SERVED with sweet potato fries.  They seem to have a light tempura coating which I loved.  Again... Unique and tasty.  \n\nThe blackened salmon tacos are built with a vinegar slaw.  Very light  very flavorful! The salmon is fresh.

I was expecting a thinner slice of meat.  I got a bite of the longaniza (sausage)  it was lean and tasted fresh  seasoned just right.\nThe server stated that they cure their meats and make sausages from scratch. They do taste fresh and homemade.\nThe dish came with this amazing garlicky pan fried rice  pickled papaya (only a spoonful  hoping for a decent size)  3 sunny side up fried eggs. They even have the exotic blend of white vinegar for dipping the meat.\nOur other  guests ordered the Seoul Benny Benedict and it looked yummy  anything with Korean grilled short ribs is heavenly! the Huevos Rancheros breakfast looked like a hot mess (lol) on the plate with so many components on top of each other but  it tasted equally delicious accdg to my friend. I wish I had a bite to kinda' give you more of how the flavors came together. \nThe Benedict's menu is a must. It's definitely a fusion of flavors and this restaurant offers an eclectic menu that keeps you wanting to go back for more and try some interesting  dishes. \nA great place for breakfast!  \nThis is a minimalist  casual dining joint.\nThe chef comes out and takes his time to greet all his diners...impressive!"", 'The pork belly benedict was amazing!!!

The pork belly was very tender and not too fatty.  A very thick cut  about an inch I would say.  It's over a sour dough instead of an English muffin which was a great choice.  The hollandaise was not thick and not runny.  The house potatoes was amazing and had a little kick.  My mom ordered the homemade longsilog and it was perfect! They even added atchara (pickled papaya)and vinegar which is unusual at most American places. The service was great! Cassandra was always refilling our water and always so pleasant to talk to.

I ordered the KFC - Korean Fried Chicken sandwich with potato nuggets for the side. I did ask for the Kim chi  relish  and anything that would have been on the sandwich on the side because I wasn't sure what to expect. The chicken is really tasty and really crispy. I added the kim chi  relish back into the sandwich and it marinated and slightly softened the crispy chicken which was much tastier than my original thought of having everything on the side. The potato nuggets were well seasoned and not salty. Actually everything I had was just perfectly seasoned and the presentation was well executed.The Spare Rib sandwiches was really impressive along with the sweet potato fries. Quality and freshness is definitely the cornerstone for the chef. At the end  I was really full and so happy I came to check this place out. I'm glad to know there's such a special spot like this place for breakfast and lunch. Prices are moderate  but the selection and quality is well worth it.

My dining mate had pineapple fried rice which was loaded with raisins and nuts and she loved it  too. Service was friendly and helpful since it was our first visit.

The food. I went the Miso Pork Belly Burger and that came with seasoned fried potato wedges. This was tough to eat just based pure size  but all of that jaw work totally paid off in full! The Pork Belly was so tender and melted with each bite  sometimes pork belly can be overly salted or chewy and that was not the case here. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium with just a hint of pink in the middle and still super juicy! The potato wedges were crispy outside and soft on the inside definitely fresh cut  seasoned and lightly fired. \n\nEvery table comes with a housemaid chips and salsa  which was very fresh and a great snacking option to get the pallet ready for action. The service was super attentive and very fast; chef even came out at one point and asked about the meal. Great hospitality and service seems to becoming the way of the buffalo in this town  but the force is strong here at Served.', ""Good breakfast place with interesting menu.

Honestly Nothing bad to say  I definitely enjoyed the pork belly burger ... IT WAS AN EXPERIENCE I CANNOT FORGET!!', 'Came here for breakfast with the family. I guess I should have ordered the dessert looking pancakes and waffles. I ordered your typical breakfast and they do not carry sausage here. I do not like bacon so they offered this red looking sausage that I was not a fan of at all.

Chef is very nice and came out and greeted us.  Ordered his signature bi bim bap.  Meat was tender and juicy.  The Kim chee was sour and spicy.  Veggies were al dente.    I love to support small local businesses and would I've to see his business flourish.   I used to dine here when it was called intimate by the late chef don.  He would be proud."", 'I was disappointed. It was our first visit and we were excited because we like supporting local eateries. Plus I heard good reviews.\n\nOur party of four arrived shortly after they opened for breakfast. We were one of three tables. The server was nice and promptly took our order. He forgot my drink  but no worries.\n\nWe got our cinnamon rolls right away and were off to a good start. Delicious. Then we waited. And waited. And waited for our meal. \n\nI could see the panic showing on the server\'s face as he kept looking at our table to see if the food had been delivered. It had not. Yet instead of coming by and honestly explaining there had been an issue with getting the food to the table timely (maybe it hadn\'t been entered  maybe the kitchen was behind)  he avoided our table like the plague. No check in  no coffee refill  nothing. It wasn\'t until we finally lost our patience that I asked another server what was going on. She apologetically checked. She came back to say 5 more minutes. This is after watching other tables who were sat after us receive their meals.\n\nThen the meals came out at different times. My daughter ordered the kids French toast  and while the description on the menu just says ""mini French toast"" I am certain she got the adult version...with berries  almonds  etc. I asked this other server if this was the kid version and she said yes. OK fine.\n\nHers came first  then my son\'s  then my husband\'s and she said enjoy and walked off. It wasn\'t until I flagged her down did I ask about mine. Looking surprised  she went back to check. Eventually our original server brought mine with a very lack luster ""sorry.""\n\nThe food was good. Not amazing but not bad. In asking for the check  we did receive a 10% Yelp discount  although I never mentioned Yelp. The other server was again apologetic but by then it was too late.\n\nI worked as a server and a bartender for years in a restaurant  also opening five restaurants for that company and managing one overseas. The FIRST thing we told servers was to be honest with guests and to do damage control when mistakes were made. At the very least  the original server  upon noticing we hadn\'t received our meal  should have come to the table  apologized for the mistake and offered something to tide us over or at least show he was working on it. I used to teach my staff that a gesture like that goes A LONG WAY in saving a customer. Or the manager could have come by. Or the bill could have been comped (not what I was looking for).\n\nBut nothing was done until I got upset and flagged someone  anyone down to complain. Which again  was too late at that point.\n\nI wish them well but don\'t plan to return. I hope this can be used as a learning experience for the staff. We all make mistakes. But it\'s how mistakes get handled that makes a difference.', ""Came in on a Saturday mid day.  Everyone in the place was very friendly  social  and seemed passionate about what they were serving.  Matt  the chef also came out to personally check on his insanely creative and tasty offerings.\n\nVery clear there is a lot of time put into curating everything on the plate including presentation  which is what you would expect from an expensive restaurant.  \n\nThe collective group of us had the Longsilog Breakfast  The BiBimBap (lunch plate) and the Matt's Omelet and blueberry pancakes.    All awesome  all with very fresh ingredients  never too much sauce or garnish. Memorable food.  Even the pre-meal snacks were house made and awesome.\n\nA real treat.  Support this place!  So many different types of things to try and all of our mains were perfect offerings for a 2nd delicious meal later in the evening.\n\nYour missing out if you don't come."", 'It was so hard to choose a dish from the menu because everything sounded so good. My wife had the humongous burger with pork belly and I had a Peruvian dish that were both amazing! Definitely going back soon.', ""We missed the opening weekend promotions  but made it over last weekend to give this spot a try. I like the quiet location in what would be a sleepy parking lot if it wasn't for Kitchen Table. Served is tucked at a back corner of the shopping center and has plenty of parking.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is clean and simply decorated with food photos on the walls. We were greeted quickly and seated. Our waitress was friendly and we didn't have a long wait for our food.\n\nMy lunch was the Asada Salad. The steak on top was very flavorful and the salad ingredients tasted fresh. The pico de gallo provided enough flavor that a dressing wasn't necessary. The salad portion was more than enough for one person.  I also had a side of macaroni salad and that wasn't my favorite.\n\nMy husband had the Corned Beef Hash Tacos. This was a lighter meal  but he loved the flavors. The chips on the side were very tasty. The chef wouldn't share his secret seasoning blend when we asked about it. \n\nThe menu offers many great options so we'll definitely be back to try more of the menu. Next time I'll probably try one of the breakfast options."", ""I will say that the food has been the major draw to served but the service has kept us coming back. My girlfriend and I live anywhere but close to here and we make the trip happily nearly every time we are in Vegas. The chef walks the dining room every twenty minutes or so and seems to check in with every table and actually seems to care whether we like the food! Also have to say Troy our server was great and truly we never saw the bottom of the mimosa's because he's a champ. \nWe've only been twice so we haven't sampled much of the menu yet  but everything has been amazing and I really don't think you can go wrong.

Will be back"", 'Gonna try out a new tl;dr thing today.\n\nPROS:\n\n(+) solid treatment of proteins overall\n(+) French toast is god tier\n(+) delicious happy hour items (some of which seem to be lifted directly from regular menu and heavily discounted) [HH: 2-6pm daily]\n\nCONS:\n\n(-) inconsistent service on my two visits\n(-) inconsistent potatoes\n(-) some issues with ""charring""\n\n=======\n\nServed is the most recent arrival of a breakfast/lunch renaissance in Henderson  with three local-centric restaurants offering food that\'s a step up from diners. Daunted somewhat by the variety of reportedly delicious dishes  I finally found a nice opportunity for a lunchtime meal with a trio of diners  including a friend visiting town and her colleague. I also made a follow-up solo visit during happy hour.\n\nThe menu looks pricey compared to the other ""brenaissance"" spots  but all of the entrees in our group meal fell in the $11-$20 range  which accounts for most of the breakfast/lunch menu here. These dishes are big enough to share  and we ended up with copious amounts of leftovers.\n\nBut first  we had to wait. It took over 35 minutes for us to get the order  and the kitchen gave no recompense or explanation. They brought out cinnamon sugar chips with a Nutella dip  but even that took 20 minutes and seems to be a free snack for all diners according to other reviews. I truly hope that this was an isolated incident.\n\nWhen we finally received our food  our server announced the wrong order as the benedict. I barely caught it before first bites. I later learned that our server was brand-new  but that\'s still no excuse for that or for her relative inattention throughout the meal.\n\nBaked Berry French Toast ($16): I was almost ready to forgive everything after the first bite. The bread-pudding-as-French-toast was awesome. The juicy berries  crunchy sliced almonds  sweet bourbon glaze  and even the rich whipped cream were all perfect complements. I could\'ve devoured the whole thing without flavor fatigue and been satisfied for breakfast.\n\nRoast Pork Belly Benedict ($15): all the pork was tender enough and pretty tasty. The julienne chilis brought heat in some bites. The poached eggs were a little overdone  with at most half of the yolk staying in glorious golden liquid form. Unfortunately  half of the potato hash was overdone if not ""charred."" The seasoning was fine  but there has to be consistency/evenness in the cooking. Also  I just realized that we\'d intended to order the ""Crispy"" Pork Belly Benedict  so that\'s another newbie server issue. Nobody else noticed  so I guess it\'s not-much harm  not-much foul?\n\nLomo Saltado ($18): ...not much consistency between plates either. The potatoes on this dish were actually a little undersalted. The dish was good otherwise  with the beef containing the salt  the plantains providing the expected sweet and tender accompaniment  and both tomatoes and red onions turning out properly cooked.\n\n=======\n\nEyeing the 2-6pm daily happy hour menu  which prominently features tacos ($3 each  6 options)  sliders  ($5 each  7 options)  and the loaded nuggets appetizer ($5 a plate  2 options)  I came back a couple of days later to give them another shot. I got an experienced server who walked me through several of his favorite menu items. I went for a varied  big order  and I stopwatched the arrival of the tacos at about 15 minutes post-order; the sliders and nuggets followed within 10 minutes after that.\n\nEach taco comes on two semi-crispy 4-inch tortillas  and none which I ordered were spicy. The Birria was a delicious marinated beef taco that tastes like something traditionally Mexican. The Fish isn\'t the fluffiest  but it\'s crispy and goes well with the provided lime wedge. The Shrimp Tempura was easily my favorite  with plump shrimp popping in my mouth with every bite. Its mother would be so proud.\n\nI went for the sliders corresponding to the priciest burgers  the Umami and the Wellington. They\'re maybe 3 inches in diameter at best  and they come skewered. The only notable missing ingredient compared to the full-size version is eggs  but they were both still delicious  albeit a little salty. The Umami had a nice monkfish liver and I loved the yuzu aioli  but the nori was too clunky and hard to bite through. Shredded nori would\'ve been better. As for the Wellington  I loved the cheese and crispy potato strings  and aside from one or two burnt mushroom bits  I can see why this is my server\'s favorite burger.\n\nFinally  I eyed the Longanisa Nuggets and realized that I had to get a to-go box. The plate is massive. The egg was also omitted here  but it was pretty good and very filling. I loved the cheese  salsa  avocado  and sweet sausage. The potatoes were more consistent this time  but they\'re not excellent still.\n\nServed turned out to be a pretty good place when considering the best parts of two visits. I\'ll definitely return for HH and I\'ll probably give more of their regular menu a try  including their on-again dinner.', ""I received my Yelp shout out on this restaurant and decided to give it a try. After a bit of research I was excited about the menu....so today was the day.\nRELAX....CHILL...DONT GO WHEN YOUR IN A HURRY.

He has passion and I can definitely taste the Passion behind the dishes. Great local discovery. Awesome service. I will be back for sure. Must try the salmon curry dish  on point and delicious.', 'Not one thing was bad here! Everything was amazing! Bread pudding French toast is a must try!', ""Now that I've been here three times I need to update my review to reflect how much I love this restaurant. Each time I return I find that improvements have been made to a place that is already so great. \n\nThe menu offers a great variety of options. On the weekends they offer both lunch and breakfast options. Breakfast options not only include dishes like benedicts and French toast  but also Filipino breakfast items. The lunch menu is extensive as well and includes burgers  salads  tacos  and more Filipino dishes. It would take awhile to work your way through all of the menu options. The chef also seems to experiment with new dishes often which further adds to the nice variety of menu items.\n\nEvery food item I've had here  lunch or breakfast  has been delicious. Most recently I ordered the Short Rib Benedict. Every last bite of this was delicious. The short rib was tender with a delicious flavor in every bite. The sourdough bread instead of the traditional English muffin was a step up from the usual. The bread was buttery and the poached egg was perfectly prepared. The hollandaise sauce was tasty. The breakfast potatoes on the side were crispy and nicely seasoned. My husband had the Teriyaki Burger which was out of this world and paired with also out of this world Crispy Potato Nuggets on the side.\n\nThe service is always friendly and welcoming. Our waitress on our recent visit was great  checking on us frequently and providing friendly service. During two of my visits the chef came out and talked to all of the tables to make sure everyone was happy with their food. I love when a chef/owner cares enough to come out and talk to their customers."", 'Overpriced and bland.  Found this place on yelp and am disappointed.  Be ready to spend more on eggs Benedict than you would at most brunch places on the strip.  Although we came at noon on a Sunday  the place was dead.  I can see why.  The servers were very helpful and the service from them was good.  Like the other yelpers posted  the owner/chef walks around to ask if the food is good or if we need anything else.  I replied  ""Actually  yes.  The eggs Benedict does not have much hollandaise sauce.  May I have a little more?""  He said yes  disappeared in the kitchen  and never came out.  After 20 minutes  we finished and left.  Why bother asking if you\'re not gonna do it?  I ordered the soft shell crab benny. The crab was not seasoned and lost in a lot of batter. The hollandaise amounted to a little drip.  I could honestly not taste it. That\'s why I asked for more.  However  the eggs were poached perfectly.  Anyway  next time I\'m in the mood for brunch  I\'d rather go to Kitchen Table down the block  which has similar food and more flavor.', ""Amazing food. I usually come here for brunch. This place is never packed and I don't understand why.

The wait on food was horrendous. \n\nWe got the berry French toast.  It was super delicious  but just DRENCHED in that berry syrup  which made it soggy from the get-go.\n\nThe Ono wings were my fave.  They had good flavors  just wish there were more sauce on them or on the side (waitress was too busy  so we couldn\'t ask for more sauce).\n\nThe burger with the mushrooms... do not get it. They were the greasiest burger ever.  My fiancé and I wanted to split the burger  I see what the chef was trying to do  he wanted to do us a favor and split it for us in the kitchen  but he didn\'t have to add more oil or grease or whatever it was then put it back on the grill insides down.  So when that happened  it dried out the meat and made everything else inedible. \n\nAnd they didn\'t have bottled water... the girl told me  ""our water is filtered though.""  Ok  thanks... I\'d hope so.', ""Food is fantastic. Service is slow. Understandable it's Sunday brunch and the food is going to take awhile. It wasn't my first time here and server never offered chips and salsa which had always been complimentary in previous visits. Than waiting for 15 mins to order is another downgrade. Brunch arrived and everything was great. Fast forward waiting another 15 mins for the check. This would've been alright if it was large restaurant. But with only 12-4 top tables and 4 servers that is unacceptable. Again awesome food but service is in slow motion."", ""This is arguably the best breakfast I've had at a restaurant.

I had the roasted pork belly tacos that were absolutely phenomenal. I also tried the mac salad which was great yet a tad bit on the dry side but everything else greatly made up for that. The chef came around and asked how our meal was and listed the ingredients in our dishes since we loved the diverse tastes.

First  the ambiance is very odd. It's in a business park and the space feels like it was meant for a commercial business. Also it felt as though they didn't have air conditioning so it felt like a sauna the entire time we were there. \n\nThe food  which is always the most important part  was not very good. I ordered the Filipino breakfast  which is one of their most popular dishes. The eggs were fine  but the garlic fried rice was so hard it was inedible.

It was a huge portion with a side of potatoes. One friend had the crispy baked berry French toast  which was delicious and had homemade whipped cream on top.

My sister and I got the shrimp tempura sandwich and pork belly burger and shared it. \nWhen it comes to tempura  you don't want it to feel heavy since its fried and you can tell if it's been cooked in old oil. This tempura was nice and light! Super yummy! With the bread and sauce on top  it was definitely something new and satisfying. \nThe burger was just super meaty and delicious.

The chips were light and crispy (there were other seasonings as well  however  I can\'t remember what they were) and the dip was fantastic.

I had found out where they get their coffee  but of course  I can\'t remember and I don\'t know where I had seen or heard it. Either way  I\'ve seen people raving about the coffee in multiple reviews  so the coffee is a must.\n\nI like the uniqueness of the menu and the play on classics; that\'s my favorite type of dishes.

Even though we were there during breakfast  they still offered their lunch menu (so awesome).\n\nCorned Beef Bread Pudding Benedict ($17): Fresh marble rye bread pudding  corned beef hash  poached eggs  and hollandaise. I was the most excited about this plate because it bascially combines my favorite foods into ONE MEGA DISH. The bread pudding was a really cool because it was made to be more savory and the rye gave it a nice distinctive flavor. The corned beef hash was very tasty and had a nice crust. The ""benedict"" of poached eggs and hollandaise rounded out this neat combination. The eggs were inconsistently cooked; one was a decent poach whereas the other one was way overdone (no runny yolk). Anyway  this dish was absolutely delicious and something I\'d order again! Side note: I just realized the menu says it\'s served with breakfast potato  but I didn\'t get anything.\n\nLongSiLog ($13): Filipino breakfast; three eggs  Longanisa (sausage)  garlic fried rice  Atchara (pickled papaya)  and vinegar sauce. A traditional Filipino breakfast with its own mash-up of a name; Longanisa  Sinangag (fried rice) and Pritong Itlog (fried egg). Though I have experience with longanisa and garlic fried rice  the combination of ingredients and flavors was new to me. The overall flavor profile I got was ""vinegar-y"" and almost sour because of the pickling and sauce. I didn\'t really love it  but it is a good dish and I\'m sure if you grew up with LongSiLog  this is a welcomed comfort meal.', ""I personally thought it was great! The one I was with thought it was just okay lol.

Our server made us feel right at home and she was warm and kind to us all throughout. She's also got honestly the most personality I've seen in a server in a long and hot minute. \n\nWe ordered the Truffle Mushroom\nburger and the Korean BBQ plate. The food  as massive as it was  was kind of a let down.

MELT IN YOUR MOUTH. The avocado  arugula and tomatoes on the sandwich were fresh and all these flavors just melded so nicely that I could have kept eating if there was more.  It comes with a small side... I opted for the mac salad which is not your ordinary mayonnaise-drenched mac salad. Oh no... I don\'t know what the dressing was but it was not heavy and it was not salty.  \n\nThe Service\nFriendly  quick  on top of it!\nJamie the hostess/server was friendly and quick to get our ice tea  and quickly refilled them (I was thirsty) several times.  They were never empty.  I love this!  She also didn\'t rush us nor did she hover while we were trying to decide what to get.

From there it got even better... The pork belly burger was amazing!!!!  The best burger I've ever eaten.  We also had the pork belly fried rice and the Wellington burger.  Every bite put a smile on our faces (and we can be tough critics).  The meal was so incredible we had to have their desert which was a berry bread pudding.

I wasn\'t planning on ordering one  but was appalled at this comment. We have a large party half of which are 13 year old boys. Is he assuming that since I\'m ""the mom"" I have to take care of everyone? I was also holding my four month old baby when he said this. So  new moms can\'t enjoy mimosas?

Great fusion dishes offerings for breakfast and I went with The Seoul Benny: Two scallion pancakes topped with kim chi  pickled radish  Korean short rib  two poached eggs & hollandaise sauce.  The ingredients tasted high quality  fresh and was cooked perfectly.  I was especially happy with how the poached eggs and Korean Short Rib complimented each other.  Great vision.\n\nValue: 5/5 Tasty dishes prepped with high quality ingredients for under $20 or slightly over is what I look for in value.  When I find it  you know i\'ll be back.

The tables are spaced perfectly and I enjoyed the over sized plates our breakfast entrees came out in.  Very foodie friendly  I dig it.\n\nSummary: I often tell my friends that the Vegas Valley has low key transformed itself into a foodie mecca.  The celebrity chefs and restaurants on the strip are great but it\'s restaurants like Served that is the catalyst for this transition.  When you\'re getting interesting  high quality dishes around the $20 range  there\'s definitely competition compression with higher end restaurants.

But  if the food is good then I consider the value to be there.  In this case it was worth it.  We ordered the Green Eggs and spam (GR&S) and the Korean Fried Chicken (KFC).  The GR&S matched the namesake served over a garlic rice with a side of delicious ginger slaw and a vinegar sauce.  The garlic rice was simple tasty  very good. Wasn't sure what to do with the vinegar. Only issue was the eggs were unevenly cooked and not to they way I ordered them.  I ordered over medium and one came out over hard and one over easy. The KFC was topped with amazing Kim Chi and served with a side of crispy seasoned potatoes and skin that were very good.  I would recommend this restaurant to any self proclaimed foody or anyone looking to try food off the normal beaten path."", ""The service was spectacular. The food was phenomenal.

Great quality  great selection  diverse and interesting...the service was also great. The chef came out at the end of our meal to ask how everything was.

The personal touch is what put this place above all others! Ordered my dish w/out beans and the chef brought me some on the side  personally  suggesting I try a bite. He wasn't pushy  just passionate about his dish! He was right...they were great! Also had the papusa on suggestion and that was a dish of incredible flavor and different from anything else I've ever had. This place is a must try!  Ask for Joe the server!"", ""Outrageously delicious  hot turkey sammich with jus  horsey sauce  and provolone was best I've had in memory.

Tacos were phenomenal and I'm picky with tacos for sure made my top 3 of best tacos I've had. Seafood so fresh it was refreshing. My boyfriend ordered the Miso Pork Belly Burger  it was huge but was so delicious he had to finish it.

Very satisfied with this restaurant  plan on coming here each month with our routine trip to Henderson."", 'So glad we decided to check this place out. What an incredible menu and the food is fantastic. We tried the spinach salad and pork belly sandwich which was accompanied by a truffle potato crunch of goodness.

Definitely will be back to try out more...thanks for a memorable meal!', ""Oh my goodness. I am % sure that I will visit this place several more times over the years due to my upcoming relocation. The place is small but the staff is very friendly  attentive  up beat and professional. \nTwice while we were there the chef came out to interact with patrons. The host and hostesses routinely spoke with those waiting while working to quickly clear the tables and get everyone seated and Served. \nThe homemade Doritos put Nabisco to shame. They come with salsa  their complimentary and delicious. As were the apple pie pan cakes and pupusa's with brisket."", ""We saw this place on yelp and thought we'd give it a try. Unfortunately  yelp also lead us to believe it was all day breakfast but that's not the case (breakfast ends at 2pm). That was no problem  however! \n\nWe tried the loaded potato nuggets (Which were only 5$ since it was happy hour.)  the bimbimbap  the french onion soup  and the shrimp tempura tacos! All the food was absolutely delicious. The galbi in the bimbimbap was amazing and the shrimp tempura was nice and crispy.\n\nI think the bacon in the potato nuggets was candied since it was slightly sweet  which I loved since it added a little something different. \n\nSince it was dinner  they gave bread with a green chile  poblano butter spread. That was amazing. \n\nService was good  our waitress was really sweet. Definitely need to come back to try breakfast  soon!"", ""Great  new spot in the Henderson area!\n\nLiterally about 5 mins away from work so my coworkers and I decided to take advantage and have lunch here on a Friday!\n\nMenu full of choices!

Also comes with Mac Salad. Simple yet comforting! I would do without the Mac Salad since I felt like the lack of flavor/taste! Other than that def a safe  must try dish!\n*Pupusas - about two in one order  comes with plantain  cheese  braised beef  topped with slaw  red sauce  sunny side up egg and queso fresca! Not the traditional pupusa I've had in the past but still pretty tasty! Shredded braised beef completes the doughy pupusa and love the added egg on top too!\n\nBIG portions  so great for sharing!\n\nYou get seasoned chips and salsa  similar to the bread and butter concept  while waiting for food!\n\nChef Matt  I noticed  comes to every table to make sure everyone is pleased and doing well.

We were looking for a new breakfast spot to eat while being on our vacation and this place caught our attention on Yelp. We got seated right away as we walked in. The server was really friendly and answered all of the questions about the food that we were confused about. Then we put in our orders. I'm not sure if the restaurant was short staffed today but the food came out longer than we expected. It probably took about 30-40 mins for our food. One of the reason why it didn't get 5 stars from me. The server was working by herself and she was doing a very good job. Maybe they were short staff in the front too because I noticed the staff in the back started coming up to the front and help her. Great job to the team work there. I would most likely coming back but there should another server in the front to help the poor girl out because it was busy morning! Food was delicious! I will come back again to update my review!"", 'My husband and I have been dying to try this place. So recently  we went on a Friday afternoon around noon. There were only a few tables sat. Very quiet. I wish I could rate the restaurant higher   but for me  I feel like the reviews hyped it up and it definitely didn\'t hit the mark with me. I could be bias because I\'m Filipino and have eaten at tons of Filipino restaurants. I expected more from this fusion.\n\nThe chips they gave to munch on were yummy.\nThey had no Filipino drinks  which I thought was strange since they have a few takes on Filipino dishes. They only had like apple juice or oj. Why not offer Calamansi or melon or coconut?!? \n\nAnyways  my husband ordered the langonisa burger which he gave 4 stars. It came with mac salad which I felt was bland and lacked any real flavor. He compared it to like a Hawaiian salad  and he even thought that Albertsons mac was better.\n\nI ordered the pupusas with some kind of meat and cheese and honestly didn\'t taste like anything. The plantains were the best thing on the plate  fried and sweet. But when I sent it back for not tasting at all  they took it haha.\n\nSo then they apologized and asked me what else I would like. I tried the tocino take they had. It\'s not like your normal tocino. The ""tocino"" flavor was on fried pork belly  which consists of mostly just fat. It may have tastes better if it was crunchy. But it was literally all fat. I couldn\'t eat it either. The garlic rice was no good either. (Better at baby stacks or any Filipino buffet).\n\nIt just lacked any real taste. I also thought it was weird that the waitress didn\'t ask how the food was after the second plate was considering the first one was horrible. She prob thinks I\'m a complainer lol but I just tell it like it tastes.\n\nI won\'t return. But my husband might with some of his friends who\'ve never had Filipino food lol. Price seems like it is at any other restaurant in the area  average of like 15 bucks a plate.', 'Loved this local place. The best and most beautifully delicious food. We will go there for sure when we are in Las Vegas again.', 'Uh. May. Zing!!! We came for a post-wedding celebration and I had the turkey burger with sweet potato fries. Th Burger itself is a little on the small side  (compared to the classic cheeseburger) but it was honestly perfect for my appetite. The meat was juicy and the burger was stacked high with a knife to hold everything in place. \n\nWe also tried a crispy fish taco and the shrimp tempura taco. Both were big in flavor  but I have to say the crispy fish was the favorite. \n\nThe Misses ended up getting th classic cheeseburger and let me tell you  it was HUGE! (;P) Paired with the flavorful  crispy potato nuggets and the perfect amount of cheese  this burger was bomb. \n\nWe would definitely come back to try everything on the menus. Kudos to the chef and friendly and cool af staff.', '12 of us came in today. The server was great to serve us. The food was absolutely amazing. All 12 of us ate every bite and the chef even comes to your table to check on how your service was. Highly recommended. Stellar service.', 'The food was great  a tad pricey  and service was very friendly but a tad slow. Had to look around for our waiter to take our order. Given they were a little bit busy  it was understandable. We had to wait for decaf coffee to be brewed and was never offered a refill. My mom who got regular coffee was offered a refill though. Overall great place and would come back for the breakfast.', ""I have nothing but praise for this local gem. I've tried both the Barbacoa Benedict and the Buso and both are layered with flavor. I've been back a few times and the only thing better than the food is the service and attention to detail in every aspect of the term. Even Chef comes out to see how everything is and if we need anything. I've been back a few times and will continue to do so knowing hospitality and guest service is highly a priority. Thanks Guys!!"", ""So...where to start  let me say for the most part the food was good. Not fantastic. Not amazing. But good. The service? Abysmal. Seemed like unless a customer is of Asian decent you had to wait for everything. Chips and salsa were tossed at us. Took forever for the server to take out order. Even longer to get a coffee refill. Once the food arrived it was okay. My husband's bacon was barely cooked though  rendering it inedible. Save yourself the time and go to Kitchen Table at the other end of the parking lot. Outstanding food. Outstanding service and mimosas & bellinis to beat the band."", ""There is a 15% off your entire bill coupon on yelp when you check in. Walking to the door we weren't sure if they was open or not. There wasn't many cars in the parking lot. When we got through the door  the waitress greeted us and walked us to our table. This restaurant is smaller and it holds about 48 people. But the way it is set up  it doesn't feel crowded which is nice. Chef Matt also came around to each table to check on how everything is tasting. \n\nThe food is kind of like American Asian fusion. They have Asian dishes like filipino longanisa  garlic rice  pork belly  etc. For the American dishes they have pancakes  eggs Benedict  bacon  burgers  etc. \n\n$19: i ordered the miso pork belly burger with sweet potato fries. The burger is huge! You have to open your mouth wide to take a bite. The burger comes out medium rare. The pork belly melts in your mouth and the sweet potato fries are really good. \n$13: My little brother got the green eggs and spam. The spams are thick pieces. You can taste the garlic in the rice  without it being to overbearing. $18: My boyfriend ordered the Korean BBQ plate. It was ok. The plate was small compare to the price we paid. The prices are a little bit pricey. The burger was the best thing we ordered out of the three."", ""Really good food. We ordered the Peruvian lomo saltado and the corn beef  they both were delicious. I'm originally from Peru so I was excited to try their lomo saltado. It was all good. The coffee was great too. It's a nice little place. It might need more lighting  otherwise it's a good place!"", ""Yummy  and very interestingly new! The menus on Yelp show an obvious Filipino spin on Chef Matt's menu selections..until we read on. Next  we looked at the pics  and suddenly...ooohs  whoas filled the car. The restaurant is in an unassuming spot in a strip mall  but this food doesn't belong in a strip mall...the Crispy Baked Berry French Toast is a specialty of the house and the work put into it shows..its edges were crispy and the berry syrup was good not overly sweet as one might be afraid of. The Soft Shell Crab Benedict..mmm mmm and easily a group favorite. The Corned Beef Bread Pudding Benedict was another favorite..the Corned Beef was definitely  or at least tasted  like it was made in house..now if you're Filipino  the Tocino Chef Matt serves up with Tocilog is worth trying..a good unique flavor that will never be confused with Orientex or other mass produced Tocino. Chef  great food! Next time I'm in town i would definitely go back. Please let me know if and when you move to another location in late spring.."", ""I don't know if I've reviewed Served before but it's an amazing food experience. The chef owner and his crew always comes up with awesome new food ideas  and the waiters are very passionate about food and flavors as well. It's a small comfortable little restaurant that has room for at least two big parties (8-10 people). Troy is such an excellent server and is clearly a lover of flavors. I've been coming here every so often for a while. I showed up for the thanksgiving special. Thanksgiving you have to reserve ahead of time and it's 30 per person for the turkey only option + all you can eat sides + dessert. Everything was delicious as always  Turkey was moist  candied yams hit a high sweet note with what tasted like vanilla extract  cranberry sauce had some amazing citrus notes  the veggies were awesome  the chunky mashed potatoes and gravy were excellent. There were some drawbacks  the cornbread+stuffing mix was a bit dry and under seasoned  and the guy who cut our pie slices at the end cut them super small and wonky. But overall everything was wonderful."", 'Visiting from out if town and was recommended by local. Party of six went and all were very impressed.

We were brought complimentary chips and salsa (yum!) and then ordered from the breakfast (served all day) and lunch menu.\n\nI had Matt's omelet with crispy potatoes. Delicious flavor.

We'll definitely be back!"", ""Served is a clean  well maintained  cute little restaurant on Horizon Ridge. Our waitress was very friendly and very patient with me as I took forever to pick something out of their very creative menu. Everything looked so delicious. Sadly due to dietary reasons I picked the happy hour ono wings which was $5  (our waitress said it comes with 3-4 wings we only got 3 per order). \nMy wife ordered shrimp tempura taco for $3 and the Miso pork belly slider for $5. Both were on the happy hour menu. For the kids we ordered the kids fish sticks and the kids cheeseburger. Both come with a side and a drink  we chose sweet potato fries. \n\n My wife liked the tempura taco and would order it again when she goes back. She also liked the miso pork belly slider but said she would try something different next time. \n\nThe ono wings were ok. I was disappointed when they came out to see that they were covered in a sauce. The menu didn't say they came with sauce. I peeled off the skin to remove as much of the sauce as I could. They tasted good and I'm sure there are people that like it better than I do. The first batch of wings that I ordered came out as a mixture of wings and legs. The wings were cooked good but the legs were a little raw inside. It didn't bother me as I have a cast iron stomach so I ate them. I ordered another order of wings and asked for no sauce. They came out and looked good but when I picked up a wing I noticed that there was some sauce on the cabbage bed that the wing was sitting on. So I tasted it and sure enough there was sauce on it. I asked the waitress what kind of oil do they use to cook the wings in thinking that maybe they used some special oil. She said that they used canola oil. The wings in this order was cooked to perfection. \n\nThe kids meals were good. The cheeseburger had good flavor and the fish was tasty. The sweet potato fries were cut nice and thin and seemed coated in flour with some seasoning before cooking. The natural flavor of the sweet potato fries shines through and they were delicious. \n\nDespite the issues we had with the wings we are excited to go back and try the other items on the menu that look so amazing."", ""A pretty small place with one hostess and two servers.\n\nWe were able to sit quite fast  but the service was so slow. We saw two tables being neglected while we were waiting for our table. \n\nAfter we sat at the table  we waited about 10 minutes. One server took the table who sat after ours first. She didn't acknowledge that she would be with us shortly or anything like that  even after I made eye contact with her. \n\nThere's obviously a lack of communication with the hostess and the servers of which tables to take orders first. \n\nAt that point  our food was going to take too long to get so we left. Very disappointed because I really wanted to try their food."", ""Now this place can be slightly confusing.. \n\nFirst off  the menu is HUGE!! It can also be overwhelming.\nSecond  I think it would be less confusing maybe being Filipino/ Hawaiian.. but we have American  Peruvian  and probably a few more dishes that are off the beaten path.\n\nHOWEVER  everything I ordered was delicious! Vegetable lumpia  Ono plate  and Alaskan King crab benedict.\n\nMy favorite parts was the chili on the rice and that they were not stingy with the crab! My least favorite was being Filipino The lumpia was good but I prefer the traditional way  and the wings were just average traditional Hawaiian wings nothing really to kick them up a notch. \n\nCan't wait to get back and try some other things!"", ""Had a great dinner there a couple of weeks ago. My filet was fantastic  great service and lived the deserts. A little hard to find but don't give up you won't be disappointed. Go to Serve."", 'I usually take at least 5 minutes to decide what I want off a menu  however at Served  it took me 15 minutes and I was still hemming and hawing when the waiter came. The menu is filled with the most interesting  mixed plates and it\'s hard to decide what sounds really appetizing and what sounds a little too weird of a combo.\nThe restaurant is very small and has what looks like leftover carpeting from a previous tenant. First walking in  I was a little worried that I had chose the wrong place and that the Yelp reviews were all a lie  but DON\'T LET THAT SCARE YOU AWAY. \nCorned beef bread pudding benedict: Oh. my gosh. The texture of this plate was perfect. Corned beef is usually too salty for me  but the one at Served didn\'t have me downing waters. I wasn\'t too sure what part was bread pudding and what part was benedict  but the combo worked. \nPork belly benedict: Separately  the benedict and the pork belly were not the best I\'ve had  but the combo made it good. It was all a little dry  but after popping the egg  it was fine. \nBlueberry Pancakes: We ordered something ""normal "" just in case the ""cultural favorites- redefined"" dishes didn\'t work out. The pancakes were definitely some of the best I\'ve had. Huge stack for a much lower price than other entrees on the menu! \nThe serve breakfast and lunch all day. The presentation of the food is adorable and the waiters were very friendly. It\'s the perfect place to come with a date  a SMALL group of friends or even maybe your hip mom. It\'s too small for large groups and their eclectic menu may be too much for grandma and grandpa  if their idea of breakfast is 2 eggs  2 pieces of bacon and hash browns. \nIt almost hurts me to write this review.

The potato appetizer was amazing. It was very flavorful and were impressed. When we got our entrees one order was wrong the gave us the spicy pork and the crab not the ribeye.

Served is a quaint little spot in Henderson with a chef who has big ideas and the skill set to pull them off splendidly.  The restaurant is quaint and rather small which is totally fine as it seems more inviting this way.  I happened to go on a weekday afternoon so it wasn't busy at all which rocked.  The service was great and waitress was very attentive and kind.  She told us a bit about the place and the chef and how he makes just about everything from scratch which was pretty awesome to hear.\nNow to the food.  It rocked!  I got the miso pork burger which I assumed to be a burger made of pork but it turns out the miso pork came on top of the burger which made it stand about 66 inches or so tall.  Literally every bite oozed juice  that's how well it was made.  It was outstanding and the mac salad on the side was quite refreshing and a good accompaniment.  The rest of my group got the tempura shrimp po'boy  the banh mi  and the berry french toast  all of which  according to them  were fantastic as well.   \nI don't know if it's because it wasn't that busy or because this is just how he is but the chef came over and welcomed us after our meal and thanked us for eating there  asked us how we enjoyed it  and if we needed anything else which was an extremely kind gesture.

(The menu states  ""variations of a cinnamon apple available upon request "" but I was told they actually don\'t do that anymore so I went ahead and ordered it as is). Although I am not a huge fan of berries in general  I actually found the balance to work out well and enjoyed every bite. \n\nThe host was kind  the waitress was very attentive  and the chief did a great job with the food and making sure we were happy. \n\nThe restaurant inside is somewhat limited seating so I could see it being rather crowded on weekends. It\'s a somewhat upscale place  but I noticed baby/toddler chairs stacked in the corner so they are kid friendly. Depending on how crowded they are would probably determine if I would bring my toddler though due to it\'s size and overall feel of the restaurant. I will most definitely be returning though.', 'The food was pretty good. Ordered the smoke salmon Benedict and the huevos rancheros. They have large portions.

Truly a gem!"", ""I was so excited to try this place but I had literally the worst meal I've ever paid for  the Chile Verde Benny that looked like soup and the only flavor was the lime I squeezed into the soup. I will say that maybe this was a fluke because all the other dishes coming out looked delicious. Waitress said that this was how the dish was supposes to be and unwilling to admit an obvious failure of a dish.

But it BLEW ME AWAY!! \n\nNow I forgot our server's name since time passed; but phenomenal service. He was so down to earth  great with giving us suggestions. And totally understandable of our two little ones. He brought out kids cups  extra plates and napkins without us even asking. He even brought my two year old fresh home made cinnamon chips with some bomb Nutella whip sauce to go with it. My kid went crazy over it! My inner kid secretly did too. Haha. \n\nLoaded Potato Nuggets- bomb appetizer. The potato nuggets were nice toasty fried oozing with the toppings. The bacon bits added a nice touch. I recommend sharing between more than two people because I was getting full just from this. It's pretty fried and heavy. \nBiBimBop- huge serving and so much galbi! So tender; so delicious. I'm salivating just thinking about it. And the use of colored carrots - nice touch\nMiso pork belly burger - I can't say much about this  but my husband couldn't stop raving about his burger to me. But his tempura sweet potato fries were absolutely delicious. \n\nI'm going to have to come back and try their brunch and the rest of the menu. The food is pretty pricey  but definitely worth it.

The place looked closed so I got out of the car to try the door; very glad I did as they were open. (Maybe invest in a ""We\'re Open"" sign?). There was a 10 minute wait as they were full but once we were seated our waitress immediately set us up with our drinks and explained the different menu items to us - different being the key word here.  There were several Eggs Benedict - I chose Pork Belly Eggs Benedict  and was deliciously surprised  the eggs were perfectly cooked and the French bread base was beautifully crisped and seasoned - along with a few Filipino breakfast items and an egg dish with green Thai chili.  There was also Huevos Rancheros with langonisa - whatever that is - that I\'ll try next time.  My sister had the Bam Slam consisting of two perfectly cooked eggs over easy  fluffy pancakes  crispy yet soft on the inside potato nuggets  and house bacon.  The bacon was overly sweet for our taste; they coat it with brown sugar and pepper  might like the option of regular bacon...\n\nMy only complaints relate to their selection of tea: my sister ordered hot tea and all they had were herb or green teas  no Earl Grey  Breakfast or any sort of black tea and they only offer Mango flavored ice tea; I was almost able to disguise the taste with lots of lemon.  Expand the tea selection  offer plain bacon (or less brown sugar) and you\'ll have a customer for life!', ""Great service and food. The Benedict had perfectly poached eggs and a nice crispy bun. I'll be back"", ""I don't come here everyday  but I am a repeat customer and do on occasions go out of my way to come here. This place is a quiet joint  but even with that sometimes has slow table service.

We shared the shrimp tacos and the longaniza burger. Everything was very fresh. I loved the sauce on the tacos. With the burger  none of the flavors were overpowering and all blended together really well. The burger was cooked at a perfect medium. There wasn't much that we could give to the toddler  but I wouldn't hold that against anyone and they were really accommodating on finding something that he would eat  which ended being toast lol.

What a nice little brunch spot! we went on a Sunday morning around 10am and was seated immediately - not having to wait is always an added plus! We both had a Mimosa and enjoyed the breakfast items we ordered. The ambiance is pleasant and the overall dining experience was made better as we were greeted by surprise and ""SERVED"" by a friend of ours that I didn\'t know recently started working there.

I had a BLT with avocado.  I didn't count but there must have been 8-10 pieces of bacon and the heirloom tomato was amazing.  My wife had salmon tacos which were just terrific.\n\nWe had chicken wings as an appetizer.  They were with a somewhat asian flavor and without a doubt the best I've ever tasted.

We entered Served after seeing Kitchen Table had a 45 minute wait. No problem. It\'s Sunday brunch. Everything\'s busy. We walk in and it is very small and quaint.  There is a family of 5 waiting at the host stand ( not talking to anyone) and we are behind them. After waiting several minutes with no acknowledgement I walked around the family and walked up to the hostess. She looked at me briefly then turned and began talking to the family. So I went back to the back of the family. After several more minutes the blonde hostess/server ( which by the way is always a great idea) walked by us and said ""it\'ll be a few minutes"". That is our first sort of interaction.  Okay still no problem. It\'s busy I understand. Now she walks by again and says ""a few more minutes is it just two"". I said yes she walked away. At this time the family is sat and we are alone up front. Then a few minutes later a couple walks in behind us. I watch as minutes go by and no one acknowledges them either. Finally I hear the man say let\'s go somewhere else. And they leave ( not a great way to lose business in a competitive industry with a heavy hitter in the same parking lot. It would seem to me that you probably can\'t afford to lose customers.). Anyways we finally get seated. The waitress (same as blonde hostess) says "" just water?""  I reply "" yes   and"" she walked away before I could speak. We were ready to order. Waiting a while we looked at the menu and had decided. ( we grabbed our own menus  were not offered). So i was ready to catch her on the water flyby/drop off. Well no chance. She dropped and ran. ( this place has maybe 12 tables with 4 servers and a busser guy). Well we waited and waited.  I made eye contact with many people and the chef/ I believe owner.  Nothing. After about 12 minutes waiting we left. Hungry.... disappointed. Won\'t be back. Thanks. Great work. Still looking forward to Kitchen Table.', ""I've been to several of the breakfast/lunch only places that have opened in the neighborhood recently. I often wondered what really differentiated them from getting breakfast at Denny's or IHOP. For most of them  the menu is fairly routine and the food is ok but nothing to write home about. None of that is true for Served. This is a fairly small restaurant ( maybe 20 tables) hidden off of Horizon Ridge Parkway. You really have to know that it's there because it is not visible from the street and could easily just drive by. At Served  the menu is anything but routine. The breakfast menu is loaded with items that you cannot get any place else and you certainly cannot make it yourself at home unless you are a Gourmet Chef. As soon as you order  they bring a basket homemade chips that are coated with cinnamon and sugar. In addition there is a side of a Nutella dipping sauce. Wow is that good. Very tempted to just eat the chips and Nutella and skip the meal. Needless to say I didn't do that. I ordered the Matt's omelet. It looks like the size of a 4 egg omelette but it is egg whites only. It is loaded with turkey  bacon (lots and lots of bacon)  spinach  yellow peppers and topped with avocado. It comes with a side of potato nuggets and toast. Has to be the best omelet I've ever eaten. My buddy ordered the triple-decker club sandwich. He ordered it with a side of sweet potato fries. He loved the sandwich. But I thought the presentation was what was really spectacular. Our server  Hunter  did an outstanding job despite the fact that he's only been on the job 3 days. The restaurant manager  Jamie  came by several times to make sure everything was going well and to give us a little history of the restaurant.\nThis is why people go out for breakfast. Outstanding service and food that you could not prepare for yourself at home. I definitely will be back very soon."", ""One of my favorite restaurants. Not your typical menu with lots of interesting choices. The service is great  and if the chef/owner is not swamped he comes to your table to ask about the food. I have never been disappointed. It's a great find."", ""I took my Mom to breakfast at this hot new business yesterday morning and we had absolutely no regrets. It is located up off of Horizon Ridge Parkway in a nice new strip mall. It was pretty easy to find with ample parking. \n\nThe restaurant itself is a small intimate setting. The tables are simple and modern and each table has a small succulent plant as the centerpiece. We arrived around 9:30am and there weren't too many people so it was very comfortable. We were greeted by our lovely hostess/server who promptly sat us at a table by a window and provided drinks instantly. The menu is very diverse offering meals from Mexico to the Phillipines. I chose the Huevos Rancheros and Mom chose the Bam Slam. \n\nWhen the breakfast arrived  it was hot and looked delicious. The Huevos Rancheros was served with three corn tortillas that were fried and sitting on a platter of Peruvian beans. Three eggs topped the tortillas and queso crema was the icing on this mountain of goodness. Along the sides of the dish was a layer of sweet  green salsa and then there was an inner layer of hot red salsa on the eggs and potatoes. The dish produced so many different flavors and textures. The Peruvian beans were a unique change for this dish as I have usually only had it with refried beans. The Bam Slam was huge and can easily feed two people. Eggs  bacon  potatoes  and toast and Mom was very full by the time she was done. What I enjoyed most about this meal was the fact that Chef Matt came out and asked us how we liked our meals. He was very friendly and I appreciate when the chef wants to know your opinion. It tells me that he genuinely cares about the food he is creating and serving. \n\nThere were so many interesting and tasty looking dishes on the menu to sample which gives me every reason to return in order to taste more breakfasts dishes and then lunch. They aren't open yet for dinner but they are planning on it in the future. By the time we were finished  the restaurant was getting busy which I believe was attributed to the flavorful food being cooked.\n\nI suggest that when you are out in Green Valley  you stop by to be SERVED at this quaint little gem!"", 'Had been almost a year since we had enjoyed our last meal here and\nnot much has changed. Still offering an eclectic menu that is prepared very well and tastes great. Excellent friendly service. The only disappointment  to me personally is the price  of the hamburgers \nwhich are my favorite. And while they do offer choices in the size  6 or 12 ozs  it still seems a bit too high.  If your in the area give it a try  especially between breakfast & lunch. Ciao.', 'Like everyone else you need to order the pork Benedict! It is too good to be true.

The atmosphere here is amazing  definitely coming back.', 'I hate to give three stars to any restaurant but this is what yelp is for... honest reviews. \nThis place is a little local spot which made the prices a little unexpected. \n- Soft Shell Crab Benedict $20 ... there was such a small amount of crab that I could not understand the $20 for basically an eggs benedict with no meat. The sliced potatoes were the best part of that dish. \n- Apple Pie Tempura Pancakes $12. The portion size was large and it came with tempura fried slices of green apples. The pancakes themselves were good but the sauce from the green apples was pretty sour. We ate about a third because we were hungry but didn\'t take the left overs. \n- Fried Chicken and Cornbread French Toast $12. It\'s possible the menu said how many pieces of chicken and french toast but it was under entree so expected and entree. What came out was three regular to small size chicken wings and three fast food sized French toast sticks. This should not be served as a meal but rather as an appetizer... maybe. I was the only person that ate from this plate and was sick to my stomach most of the day after the meal.  \n- Watermelon juice was the juice of the day and we left two cups of it untouched because  well  it just wasn\'t good. I think we paid $13 for a small and a large juice. \nThe chef did come out after our meal and ask how everything was... I didn\'t say anything about the food to him because I knew there would be nothing else on the menu I would want to try and I was not feeling well by that point. Spending $75 on a meal (after the drinks and tip) and feeling slightly nauseous and still hungry after  will leave anyone writing a mediocre review.

It was kinda empty when I went  but at least that meant we were able to order quickly.\n\nI ordered the salmon togarashi which was pretty good in terms of taste and visual aesthetics. The skin was crispy (very important for me) and the fish was cooked very well. If i had one thing about the dish that was iffy  it would be the hollandaise sauce. Keep in mind that I generally don't like creamy  saucy things  so I am biased. The sauce just felt kind of out of place for the dish and I think it would have been better if they used a different sauce (but I guess they were trying to incorporate some brunch aspect to the dish). I also think this is the first dish I ever had with flower petals (unless it was something else lol). The veggies and mashed potato thing were delicious! I wish they gave me more  but this is a more classy  upscale place so I definitely understand the smaller portion. My friends ordered the salmon curry dish (their only complaint was that it was a little too spicy  but I didn't try it) and the miso pork belly burger (which looked delicious and it was pretty huge).\n\nThe overall experience was decent  but I wasn't really blown away.

The waitress told me they quit serving that item at 2 p.m. however she would ask the chef if he would make it. So glad he said yes! Possibly the best corned beef hash I've ever had.

The server was very friendly. Hubby ordered pork belly benedict. I got the tocino  which was made in house  and egg plate. We ordered my son a burger with sweet potato fries. Pork belly benedict was average  I felt like a lot of the appeal of this place has to do with how they plate their food but in my honest opinion I feel like it was doing too much. The tocino was good  but I felt like it was so fatty I wasn't left with much desirable meat to be eaten. My 14 month olds kids meal was probably the best dish on our table. The burger was wonderfully made and the shoe string sweet potato fries were delicious. I feel like it was overpriced and the quality of food did not justify the prices.

Colossal tip of the hat to the owners of this establishment  recommend this as a breakfast lunch and dinner destination', 'Had an awesome brunch here. The bennys are legit and the bacon is amazing.

Will definitely be going back and will bring my friends. Thank you again!"", 'Hubby brought me for my birthday weekend...LOVE!  I tried the chicken adobo and eggs and hubby had the longsilog.  Everything was delicious as usual.  The menu has grown since our last visit  plus they are now open for dinner during the week - now there are so many other things to try here! Chef Matt came by and hubby needed some extra rice for his meal (you know how us Filipinos are)...other than that  we let him know everything was delicious.  I love how creative and tasty his dishes are  and it saddens me to see so many others try to bash this place.  Hoping to be back soon to dry the Peruvian Lomo Saltado and the Bento.  This is the only place that we always finish our meals at the restaurant.  I absolutely LOVE this place.', 'Very nice  believe me  I enjoyed my brunch very much. Fantastic French toast and s portobello Florentine  very nice indeed. All of our friends meals also impressive in appearance and full and fantastic flavors. We sat next to the kitchen door and every plate caught our attention! Fantastic!\n\nOne improvement I would like: cappuccinos please. I enjoy a cappuccino with breakfast and brunch.', 'We came here around 5ish in the afternoon and found ourselves being the only customers on a Saturday night. We chose our seat and was greeted by our server Troy. I tell you.. he has the best customer service my fiancé and I have ever encountered. He helped us choose the most popular dishes on the menu. We ended up getting kimchi galbi fries as our appetizer.. huge portion! My fiancé ordered the miso burger which was a 16oz steak with flavored pork belly in their special sauce and refreshing arugula!! I ordered the Peruvian lomo Saltado which was pieces of beef  caramelized onions  cherry tomatoes and plantains and topped with 2 sunny side eggs. Delicious stuff!\nWe loved how the chef kept checking in on us asking for our opinion on his dishes. \nWhat I love most about this restaurant is the fusion of different cultures and flavors that the chef has created. I almost wanted to cry when eating our food.', ""This place is phenomenal  a fusion of culinary creativity in a cozy  intimate environment. The chef/owner Matthew Meyer  was humble and gracious enough to take the time and personally check on the entrees and how our experience was. This is a man that takes his work and passion seriously  which  in a city overwhelmed with service options makes all the difference. Sorry for the half-eaten entrées  the food smelled too good to wait. If you're coming for brunch  you NEED to request Troi  he's the only one in this town that understands the true meaning of bottomless mimosas  and made a perfect suggestion for my and my girlfriend's plates as this was our first in a series of return visits."", 'Have you ever been in a situation where you wanted brunch  but didn\'t know where to go?  With 9.5 other people (one being a small child)?  All of different ethnicities and food tastes?  And with no reservations?  Well  I was in this situation last Saturday.  Thankfully  Served bailed me out and provided a wonderful brunch to this motley crew.\n\nEven without reservations  the staff snuck us in and seated us pretty quickly.  While the majority of my party ordered regular ""American"" breakfast food  I could not pass up the longsilog  which came with 3 crispy-cooked links of Filipino sausage  pickled papaya  and garlic fried rice topped with 3 fried eggs  just like Mom used to make (if you grew up in a Filipino household).  \n\nMy brother-in-law did get the soft shell crab benedict  which he ""crushed "" leaving the plate clean.  Other offerings at the table included some huge omelets and a few orders of blueberry pancakes.  By the end of the meal  all of our plates were empty  but our bellies were full', 'I had brunch with some girlfriends on Sunday. We had waitress that was young  seems to be new at her job and was kind of all over the place. We didn\'t have silverware from the beginning; had to ask the chef and he brought it to us. She served us all room temperature water w/no ice. When we were closing out our bills  she originally came to by friend and was telling her about the mistake she made on my card. After telling her it\'s my card  she explained to me she charged my debit card $35 for my bill and $80 from a different table. She was very apologetic for the mistake she made and let me she cancelled it. I wanted to know how long it would take for the cancel because now I don\'t have the funds available I need. For me in that moment  I couldn\'t fathom how she was nonchalant she about the $80.00. As if  its not almost $100 charge pending in my account and I now don\'t have the funds available for my appointment soon after. The manager came over explaining again like its not an issue and it would will be available because it was cancelled. After  I pleaded my case. He gave me $50.00 cash (not $80.00 as he said in the reply to my friends post) for my troubles. If we  didn\'t say anything they wouldn\'t have done anything. My friend wrote a comment on yelp regarding her/our experience at this restaurant and in returned we were called ""ghetto"" and picking on a new business. This is so offensive to all of us because we are all beautiful  proud  minority woman of god. We are all educated  hard working citizens with careers. But  automatically stereotyped because we\'re minority woman. Jokes on him because we came with money to spend and tips to give for good service. But  due to the lack of 5 * service  management skills and training- we are now ""ghetto"". All in all  the food  mimosa\'s were amazing and the chef/owner was awesome. However  the manager  Manny and the young waitress need more training on how to deal with paying customers. I would also recommend bring cash because you\'ll be the ""ghetto"" customer that is picking on a new business because their not seasoned in the line of work their in. I came from The Kenwood Inn & Spa-  5* resort/restaurant/spa in Sonoma Country  CA (wine country baby) . I know about top notch customer service and that is the Chef. Unfortunately  he cant run a business by himself. Note to Chef- get a new manager for upfront he\'s bad for business and replying to these reviews.', ""I've loved Served for years and really need to come here more often. I'm happy that they're now open for dinner on certain days because the dinner menu is just as delicious as the menu they've had for years.\n\nThe space is tucked away and you wouldn't know it existed unless you were specifically looking for it. The dining area is small  but modern.\n\nEverything I've ever had is delicious  creative  visually appealing  and cooked to perfection. The flavors are well developed.

Most of the time you'll even see owner/chef Matt Meyer come out to make sure your meal is going well  which demonstrates the level of care Served is trying to give its customers."", 'Soft shell crab benedict!! Yummmm!!!\nLove their experimental menu. I hope they can move to a new location with better ambiance  once their business takes off! Foodies must try!', ""PLEASE LOOK AT THE SCREEN SHOTS !!!!\n\nThe two stars are because of the food and the chef but I went to brunch with my friends on Sunday. The food was delicious and who we think was the chef did come out and ask if everything was going good. But the waitress was just not good. Maybe it was her first few days as a waitress but it doesn't excuse their unprofessional behavior and also it wasn't super busy. First she gave us our food and walked away from the table without giving us silverware. Then we had to flag down the chef to give it to us. Then we went most of our meal without giving us water and when we did get the water it was warm with no ice . THEN They charged my friends card with another tables bill then charged her for her own meal. The other tables bill was $80 and hers was about $40. The waitress came back and explained to her what happened and gave her a receipt confirming the refund of the $80. But even though the $80 won't come out of her account it still sits as a pending charge. They didn't offer any thing to her as a incentive for the troubles and when she asked for something because of her troubles the manager came over and just explained what happened again. Then caught an attitude when she stated she needed the money to go to the nail appointment she had scheduled for after brunch. Again he caught an attitude and gave her a cash refund. Still with no incentive. If he wouldn't have had a attitude or maybe if they would've initially gave her the cash refund or like 10% off her meal we wouldn't be as upset....... BTW for some that don't understand she didn't get the $80 cash plus the $80 refund. They still took it out of her account. They just gave the cash refund instead."", ""Served is a neighborhood Gem.

My other sister ordered the tapsilog which the tapa had more fats then meat. My husband ordered the turkey sandwich which the turkey was too dry but he liked the fried potato that came with it. We ordered the kids grilled cheese and chicken breast with rice  the grilled cheese had not enough cheese and the bread seems old then the  chicken breast was so dry and hard (left on the grill too long).

Huge sandwich on Texas toast.  Honestly  impossible to eat  but forking and knifing it didn't take away from any of the flavor.  Sriracha it up and you're good to go.  I asked for spicy and it had no heat whatsoever  but it was still perfectly cooked and crispy.  Sweet potato fries were a little salty/underwhelming  but I do like a sandwich that comes with a side complimentary so I can't complain on that.\n\nAt Served you receive a full meal so expect to pay about $15 per person at least.  You will be full and content and surprised by the uniqueness and the beautiful presentation of the food.  You will feel taken care of by the staff.

Instead  I found delicious  gourmet quality food at a decent price. There is a normal wait for the food to be cooked  so if you're used to microwaved stuff you may get antsy  but it's quick in relative terms. The servers are very nice  down to earth people  and my waitress Jamie always made sure my glass was full and I had everything I needed. \n\nI went from having a terrible day and an equally terrible headache to feeling content and relaxed  the bahn mi I ordered was perfect  succulent and crispy pickled vegetables balanced with the juicy  incredibly tender pork belly. The only thing I would change is adding a bit more cilantro  but I'm the kind of person who really likes cilantro. \n\nIf that wasn't enough  the chef and owner Matt came out to ask me how I liked it  and he was very friendly. But what impressed me even more was his 4-5 year old son holding the door for me on the way out  even while taking a box outside for his dad.

We had the berry French toast and the huevos rancheros- unbelievable flavor!', 'First of all  I\'ve eaten here now twice.  The first time I had a unique concoction of Korean/ Mexican breakfast that appeared to be unique item on the menu. It had Barbacoa and some other Asian food mixed with it? It was delivered to the table in a massive serving that could feed a family of 4. After 2 bites  I was done. The quality of ingredients was poor and I honestly felt like just seeing the food of poor quality and enormous proportion was gross. Oddly my entire family at the table somehow found their food edible. I wanted to send my food back but everything else on the menu was going to take a while to prepare and was unlikely to be any better. I ended up eating alone a few hours later. $20 down the drain and a waste of an afternoon. You would think I would never eat here again  but this morning all I wanted was a nice brunch. We went to Craft kitchen and they had a 45 minute wait... we went to kitchen table and they had a 1 hour wait.... my wife said we should give Served a second chance  so I reluctantly agreed as I was so hungry and it was conveniently easy to get a table here. On a side note  I feel like no matter how poor the food quality of ingredients is here  they will have a built in audience of hungry customers that have no patience to wait to eat at Kitchen Table where you\'re usually waiting 1 hour to get in on the weekends. \n\nFor my now 2nd shot attempt  I decided to eat an omelette to play it safe instead of the weird cuisine that has no business being mixed together.  The serving size yet again was disgustingly large and the food had zero taste and quality. Cardboard toast and bland ingredients. Maybe if I was hungover drunk it would\'ve been edible but the ingredients of Denny\'s are better than this place. The chef came out to ask my opinion of the food as did every server in the restaurant which was a nice gesture  but I was too polite in front of my wife to tell them I was going to go home to make myself try to vomit instead of digest the food. It made me start thinking trying to make light of the let down scenario  ""what would Larry David do "" if this was on a episode of curb your enthusiasm. Honestly  I\'ve been to 32 countries in the world  have loved a wide variety of international cuisines  I generally love Spanish and Asian foods but not mixed together    and pretty simple to appease  but for some reason just the thought of the food here makes me want to slap myself for ever coming. \n\n I am as befuddled about this as you probably are reading this review since there are so many other good reviews (which was why I even tried this new place)  so maybe it\'s just me and this place don\'t mix. All I can say is if they offered better ingredients like a real farm to table restaurant  and offered a menu variety that doesn\'t JUST randomly mix Asian and Spanish cuisines  they would also have a line out the door such as Craft or Kitchen Table ( the few phenomenal brunch restaurants in Henderson).  This place could maybe have potential someday but they need to rethink the menu and who their food supplier is.  An interior designer would serve them well too.', 'We come here often and usually enjoy our meal. Choose this restaurant to celebrate my birthday  sadly my order came out wrong.

We were in town visiting from Northern Cali and found this gem tucked away and I can passionately say  the food was not short of AMAZING!! The food we had was full of flavor and cooked perfectly. You first start off with complimentary chips and salsa but it's not just your typical chips and salsa. The chips were uniquely seasoned which only enhanced when you added their wonderful salsa to it. It was soooo good that I could just eat it on its own and walk out satisfied with a huge smile on my face. \n\nOn to the main course  my dish was the Turf and Side Benedict which had filet mignon  mushrooms spinach atop 2 slices of sourdough and can't forget the béarnaise sauce. The hubby had a pork belly Benedict which was equally delish! It was accompanied with some potatoes that were cooked with perfection. The whole meal was exquisite with every bite. \n\nA lot of credit to Matt  the chef  who came out to greet his guests and get feedback on his dishes. Something you rarely see and only see at high end restaurants. It shows his concern and passion for the work of art that he creates and brings to your table.

I would consider adding on the guac on another visit. \nTACOS: Our table ordered the tempura fried shrimp and the fish (tilapia) tacos  both were solid. Trio of tacos is packed with protein  liked that they didn't skimp like other places. The sauce on the fish tacos had a nice kick to it.\nASADA SALAD: Definitely get this with a side of salsa  I liked that more than the creamy vinaigrette dressing. Meat could have been cut a little smaller for easier eating  but had good flavor. I like that the salads include beans for extra protein.\n\nDecor is a little limited  but the cute plants on the tables are nice. The dark carpet and curtained-off cooking areas almost give this spot a banquet hall feel. Staff were very friendly and polite. Menu is fresh and seems to be going for a fairly healthy slant  which I appreciated. They offer all-day breakfast  would try those dishes on another visit."", ""Criticism  Name calling   Judgmental  Unprofessional  and Inconsiderate of wrong doing have been preformed by the employees who work for this restaurant. \nI and a group of friends have recently attended this location for a nice outting and we did enjoy ourselves  but while there we were  not acknowledge by the waitress  had no silverware at table   provided luke warm water  had to flag down waitress to acknowledge we were ready to order   food took a long time to be brought out and we all at the time continue our outting together as normal. \nWhen getting ready to leave the waitress charged one of my friends card  from another tables tab of $80.00 and thought nothing of it.  The waitress and the her boss was very inconsiderate of the situation and brushed it of like it wasn't a big deal.  They did not apologize nor provide any compensation for their wrong doings. Then when a friend from my group express a real life bad unprofessional experience from attending this restaurant  the employees /boss at Served attacked our who group with awful words  became even more rude and name calling towards our group of friends which is unexplainable for any customer should ever go through. We have done nothing wrong  but choose a location to eat was 100 % unprofessional in every way.  I believe that the boss and waitress could have handled the situation of their mistakes differently but they choose not to."", 'This place was amazing. My burger was enormous and delicious. My partners salmon was the best he ever had to him. They made me a michelada which was on point. Besides the food  the wait staff was so friendly. Always got checked up on. And my favorite part was the chef coming out to check on us and the food. I cannot even wait to come back and try more of the menu', 'TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT. I find it ironic that the name of the restaurant is ""Served"" when that is anything but what we got. I will start by saying that I was hesitant about going originally because I thought the prices were rather expensive for a local breakfast/lunch restaurant. However  based on the good reviews  we decided to try it. \n\nFirst thing to note upon walking in is that the decor and ambiance was a complete eye sore. The host seated us almost right away which then turned out to be our server as well. Drinks were ordered and served quickly. After a few minutes of reviewing the menu  we did have a question about the half portions. While asking about the half portions  the server began answering the question and then walked away while in the middle of explaining because he saw people coming in who needed to be seated. \n\nAfter a few more minutes  we placed our order. About 15 minutes passed and we began wondering when our food was going to come out. The server approached our table and asked what it was that we had ordered. This was a little concerning after we had placed our order 15 minutes prior. We reminded him of our order and continued to wait for our food. Another 15 minutes passed and no update on our food or what was going on. There were a total of 5 tables seated in the entire restaurant. A couple that came in 15 minutes after we arrived already had their food being served. Tired of waiting and with no explanation of what was going on or attention to our table considering the low volume of customers at the time  we decided to walk out. I work in the service industry and I can say that this was extremely poor customer service and organization.\n\nIf you are going to have high end food prices  at the very least  the guest is to be provided with their correct order in a timely manner with exceptional customer service to justify the prices. We received none of the above and decided to walk. No desire to return.', ""This is one of my favorite restaurants to go to for brunch. Their menu is so well made that every dish is delicious  not just certain dishes. Their restaurant has a cute classy family style to it  it's very welcoming  and the waiters and chef are all so friendly.\n\nFor drinks  their Mango Melon Juice is fresh made in house daily and is absolutely refreshing. I get it every time I go here.\n\nFor breakfast  their Portobello Eggs Benedict or Pork Belly Benedict is so delicious. I don't personally like eggs benedict  but I actually really love theirs.\n\nFor lunch  their Ono Chicken Wings was very delicious with a twist to Hawaiian sweet and tasty flavors. The Pork Belly Banh Mi is a fusion to Vietnamese sandwiches and had meat that was very moist. On the lighter side  the Spinach Salad is very simple yet one of my favorites. The Miso Pork Belly Burger is one of their signature dishes and it does not disappoint. As you bite into it  you can see all the juicies bursting out from the burger and it is served with crispy potato nuggets.\n\nComplimentary chips (with a secret seasoning) and salsa are served.\n\nLove the food here  love the service  love the atmosphere  only wish this place opened for dinner!"", ""Delicious food with very friendly and accommodating staff.\n\nFor some reason we waited 5 months between having brunch and our first dinner experience. Now I wish I had those 5 months back just so i could have eaten at Served more often.\nI say this with four dinners under my belt all of which have exceeded expectations. When you are first greeted by the menu it might be intimidating for someone who hasn't enjoyed asian influenced food before  but every dish I have had from the entree section has been the perfect blend of cultures. If you haven't had it yet just try the Pupusa. It is a perfect blend of well seasoned meat  cheese and thick corn tortillas. The other dish I would say not to pass up is appetizer chicken wings. There are enough to be an entire meal with great flavor to accompany. \n\nMost importantly is that on multiple visits chef Matt has come to check on his work which simply adds a wonderful touch to a restaurant that he undoubtedly cares greatly about.\n\nI would recommend Served to anyone who wants great food and great service from a neighborhood location. Don't forget that they can also do take out or delivery!"", ""I ordered the omelet and opted for all vegetarian. This omelet had shallots  mushrooms and spinach. It had to be the freshest omelet I've had. The breakfast potatoes were perfection. My husband ordered the portobello Benedict and said he felt as we were out eating in Portland. The food served uses high quality ingredients. I have never had a breakfast like this in town before. Come to Served if you enjoy high end ingredients."", ""I usually do not write reviews.   However  since this place took FOREVER to bring us our food.   I figured I use this time to say how S...L...O...W  this place is.    We have been sitting here for an hour waiting and waiting.   I really don't know about the food but the wait is HORRIBLE.  We FINALLY received our food and one of the dishes was cold. Had to send it back.  It wasn't the waitresses fault. They did the best they could. I am a business owner so it is always sad to see a business doing so bad.    I hope the owner get to read this review and make improvements.    Maybe less waitresses and more cooks.    I WOULD NOT go back to this place."", ""Chef Matt is amazing! Not only is the food amazing but the chef is down to earth and humble. Nice man who cares about his customers and wants to make sure you enjoyed every bite. I've never seen a chef come out to greet his customers and even fill up drinks. The whole staff had amazing service. We will be back."", ""Hidden gem in the Horizon Ridge area.\n\nI found this place on Yelp after searching for a Saturday brunch spot. It was off the beaten path but I decided to give it a shot after drooling over the photos posted on their Yelp review.\n\nTo start the staff were super friendly and thorough in explaining the menu. We had mimosas while deciding on our meal.\n\nI had the pork Benedict and I was actually sad when I took my last bite. Absolutely delicious. My dining partner opted for the Oreo crusted banana Nutella French toast. I sampled it and loved it. It was very rich and more of a dessert than breakfast.\n\nI'll be moving to Las Vegas soon and I will make this my go to brunch spot."", ""Surprisingly very good place.\nI've never tried Filipino breakfast till than. Very good twist (fusion) between American and Filipino traditional food. \nDefinitely recommended. I wish I lived closer so I could try other items on their menu.\nBut I will be back as soon as I get a chance to travel to Nevada again."", ""You can tell they make everything in-house. Flavors are well developed and thought out  but not pretentious or trying too hard. They even serve complimentary fried cinnamon flour tortilla chips with a banana nutella dip that's not too sweet. We had the Barbacoa Benedict and the 8oz Miso Pork Belly Burger. Tbis thing is absolutely massive for 8oz  and the pork belly was super meaty with about 1lb of cheese. And a side of their maple glazed thick cut bacon because why not . Will return with many humans so we can conquer that entire menu!"", 'After having a negative experience at Kitchen Table I decided to check out Served for my mom\'s birthday. \n\nTook a look at the menu and found that served Filipino food  which is great since my family is Filipino! The food isn\'t your traditional Filipino (the way it\'s served)  portions are very large and the dishes are posh. If you\'re not into Filipino food they also have several traditional breakfast options. \n\nThis place was the perfect ""gourmet"" breakfast place to take my mom to for her birthday. All my guests enjoyed the food and service. Our server  Manny was very accommodating and funny! Price was lower than I expected considering I had nine guests.\n\nI will definitely be back again!!!', ""So so good. I've had it on my list for awhile and so glad I finally came. This chef loves all the same stuff as me. Some Peruvian  Korean  and more. The chips and salsa are even delicious."", 'We were seriously blown away by Served. Our server was amazing- clearly enjoyed his job and took it seriously. He gave great recommendations and was on top of everything- service went just as it should. He was super friendly and made it a point to interact with our crazy toddler as well. Service was definitely on point and we definitely appreciate it! \n\nAs for the food- it was equally as incredible. The loaded potato nuggets were insane  and they even topped them with an amazing cheese sauce (it seriously was so good!) I got the BiBimBap which was so good  just the right amount of spice and a perfectly cooked egg! My husband got the Lomo. Which was also incredible and cooked to perfection. The coffee was great as well!  Highly recommend this place to anyone who likes good food and great service.', ""Little hidden gem! This place offers s variety of breakfast and lunch dishes with a Latin/Asian twist to them. I ordered the pork belly sandwich  which was delicious  accompanied by picked veggies and jalapeño. Great portions too! The service was great  everyone is friendly and the chef tá me out to see how we were doing. I'll definitely be back."", 'Just left Served. Start off with the waiter Manny is really nice and knowledgeable of the menu and gave me some good recommendations. I decided to go with the Pork Belly Benedict and it was delicious with a little bit of spice and the plate was beautiful. For dessert I had the berry bread pudding and it was very bland  it needed some sugar or salt maybe. They will improve it. But i was very happy with my entree and service.', ""This is a small  yet very chic restaurant. The decor is simple  but I liked it. Decor wise  I would suggest a 3rd curtain covering the opening near the back  it'll hide the boxes and other things patrons might not want to see. The restaurant is in a office park like location and is in the back off of horizon ridge\n\n6 of us came in today for brunch  due to the small size of the restaurant we waited a few minutes for parties to leave so 2 tables could be put together. It looks like you can also make reservations. \n\nIt started to get quite busy after we were seated  which led to a long wait to get drink orders in  then a long wait to get the food order in. The servers were doing their best to handle the crowd  but they just couldn't keep up. We ordered the food and then waited a very long time while munching on cinnamon chips with chocolate nutella dip - tasty but definitely not good for you!\n\nOur party ordered the French toast (We wanted this as a appetizer  but it didn't work out that way) it was dense  crunchy  sweet  and pretty good. There were 8 thick pieces (about a 4th of a piece of white bread  but maybe 2.5 slices thick)  covered in syrup  berries  and completely melted whipped cream. \n\n3 of us ordered corned beef hash bread pudding Benedict's  (2 of us got them  mine was given away to a different table)  one pork belly Benedict  2 of their version of grand slams. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food  but thought the bread pudding on the hash was overcooked. I was able to try a bite  I loved the hash part. All people ordering Benedict's thought the poached eggs were overcooked. \n\nThe grand slam people liked their very crispy bacon (some may say overcooked) and pancakes. Since I never received my food I polished off the French toast instead. The waitress apologized profusely for the oversight  she had the chef cook me up an order and I asked for it in a to go container - it'll make a nice dinner. She comped my meal and gave the table a 10% discount because half the table received their food about 10-15 minutes before the other half. It was a nice gesture  especially since the meals range from about 12 - 25 per plate. \n\nI appreciated the waitress very much  she was swamped so I don't blame her for the food incident or the fact that some drink glasses didn't get refilled. This is when you look at management and wonder why they can't staff properly for Sunday brunch when a good majority of people go out. \n\nI think this can be a good place  the chef might want to undercook a bit as I feel plates may be waiting under heat lamps  and they definitely go onto hot plates which continues to cook things. The waitress says weekdays are less busy  so if you're interested try at that time. \n\nService 4/5 - they are busy and I could tell trying their best to keep up. \nFood 3/5 - beautiful presentation  just a bit overcooked which can give an off flavor  bread pudding was not well received \n\nAverage 3.5 - but I'll give them a 4 for effort."", 'This restaurant was incredibly good. It is a little out of place with its location in the back corner of the shopping center on Horizon Ridge and Valley Verde. The menu is very unique and it all looked really good. Local owned business. The owner came out to check on us. The food was cooked very well if you like medium rare burgers and salmon. Flavors were so good. Good happy hour. Much more like a restaurant you would find in CA or on the strip.', 'Everything was super delicious! Nice dining environment and excellent service! We like how they make the food look like a piece of art. Will definitely go back again.', 'Amazing food! Always is super slow when I tend to come in  fresh soda out of a can  GREAT customer service.

Wonderful experience and amazing food!', ""Found this place thanks to Yelp. Glad we tried it out. The food was so delicious. They give you fresh tortilla chips and salsa. The tortilla chips are amazing. Tasted fresh and the seasoning is great. Would be happy with just a basket of those...or bowl...or huge container lol. I ordered the pupusa. Oh wow! I've never had one before and these were amazing. Topped with braised beef  slaw and over easy eggs. It was delicious. My boyfriend had the breakfast burrito. Huge burrito  only ate half. His only critic was the contents weren't mixed so some bites were just egg and tortilla. Otherwise he enjoyed it. We also got a side order of crispy potatoe nuggets based on the pics on here. So worth it. They're like breakfast potatoes/home fries but way better. They are crispy and delicious. Not overly cooked but a nice crunch on the outside and the inside is still soft. Definitely order those. \n\nThe chef/ owner even came out and asked how the food was. We didn't realize it when he came out he was the owner too. Hope this place does great bc the food is really great and the prices aren't bad. \nGood luck Served!"", ""4 1/2 stars. Arrived during the week just after they opened and was the first table to be seated. I was a little concerned there wasn't other customers but the place started filling up soon.\n\nI went with the corn beef hash which is made in house with request of rye bread. The corn beef was lean and lite tasting  potatoes cooked perfectly with farm fresh eggs. I tried the Filipino sausage  garlic fried rice and it was solid tasting too.

Would highly recommend.', ""HIDDEN GEM worthy of multiple foodgasms.\n\nI live in the northwest but had an errand near 215 & Easter so pulled my bookmarks and this was close so I stopped in.  It's tucked in the back of a small business center but not terribly hard to find.  Seating area is small but not tiny. Wait staff was friendly  helpful but didn't hover.\n\nThey serve breakfast and lunch.  I arrived at 11:30AM perused the menu only to find so many things I would love... but I stuck with what I went there to try.. Pork Belly Benedict.  Egg was perfectly cooked (amazing how many places can't poach an egg correctly!)  sauce was flavorful  topped with microgreens  a little something spicy (jalepeno?) and all that on top of a few thick slices of pork belly on sourdough bread.  The flavors were spot on perfect.  Even the side of potatoes were perfectly crisp and hot.\n\nIt was so good I ordered the pork belly hogie to go with the intent of giving it to my neighbor.  Ssssh!  It never made it there.  The combination of pork with the pickled veggies was a perfect way to cut the fat... sort of like how Carolina pulled pork uses the apple cider vinegar.  Soft roll  some kind of sauce  a little heat but not much  pork belly  crunchy pickled veggies... once again the perfect combination of flavor.\n\nThe only thing I can say wasn't spot on isn't even worth deducting a star.  It's probably just a matter of personal preference.  I found the meatier part of the pork belly a little dry.  I think it's probably braise/roast vs some sort of BBQ or perhaps frozen vs fresh... but with everything perfectly seasoned and a great combinations of flavor  it's fairly minor.\n\nThe chef/owner came out to check.  Seemed nice  genuine and interested.  I had just finished eating and was basking the the afterglow of a foodgasm so I didn't really talk as much as I normally would.\n\nThe bottom line is I would drive the 25 miles again tomorrow to eat there again... and I might!  it's clear the chef has a great palate or at least compatible with mine!"", 'Exceptional service  and delicious food!

So this past weekend chef made one for me and bestie. Wow!!! I applaud the execution first of all. With the bread crumbs golden brown and the combo of the longanisa  hard boiled egg  paired with Thai Basil rice. Sensational!---Makes great yolk porn pix too apparently.

The sausage(longanisa) was delicious and meaty. It also had a slight charring on the outside  like it was cooked over a grill. Not typically how it's served  but tasty nonetheless. The longanisa was served with three eggs  garlic rice  garlic vinegar  and a side of atchara(pickled papaya). I feel the dish could have used more rice  but that could be just because I liked the rice so much. We also ordered a side of Kim Chee  it was pretty mild. \n\nAnd I can't recommend their cucumber juice enough!  Light and refreshing  it reminded me of honeydew.

The place is larger than other places around the same area (such as Kitchen Table)  good for large parties too. Water was brought out immediately  drinks were not listed on the menu and we were not asked if we wanted something else besides the water  the lady who sat us came back and asked if we were ready to order.

The breakfast potatoes were cold when served  overall pretty good dish. \n\nMy brother got the Pork Belly Miso Burger with Mac Salad and this was also pretty good. The patty was thick and cooked medium  the pork belly was a BIG flap of pork belly  not thinly sliced... a very big and thick burger. \n\nPretty good food  would probably come back to try other items if I am around  hopefully they are fully staffed next time.

Can't wait to go back. Everything was delicious. Must try the soft shell crab benny  and kimchi fries."", 'So once again  thank you yelp for showing all the amazing food photos of a place and making me ""have"" to go there... oh and for already knowing what I want to order before I even step foot inside. The hubs and I  (Ok  ... I) tried this place out on a Saturday and I was excited to try the long silong based solely on yelp photos and reviews. The space was really small  though tidy  and there were only 2 other tables occupied. I have to agree with some of the reviews on service  was a quite a wait for drinks  especially when there was no one there. Our server was friendly  though  and have recommendations when asked  so  we ordered and waited. And waited. And waited. When we figured that surely the food would arrive any minute we received chips with paprika and salsa. Hubs loved them  unfortunately they were way too spicy for me. When our food finally arrived  he had three barbacoa Benedict  it was beautiful and the portions were huge. Unfortunately for me the garlic rice was way  way  way too garlicky for my taste (and I have always believed there is no such thing as too much garlic!). The sausage was AMAZING though. It came with a side of vinegar and the other server I pulled aside (couldn\'t find ours  in fact she never checked on us at all) when I asked what it was for said she drowns her sausage in it  and what a great tip  wad delicious. \nAll in all it was a nice place  but I had to leave 3 stars because of the lack of attention by service (ours at least)  and the fact that I could only eat 1/2 of my meal. I couldn\'t even say anything about the rice because the first time we saw our server after ordering was after my husband had already finished  there was no point. I will probably give this place another try and will ammend my review if it changes  and I hope it does because this spot has potential and I love small businesses.', 'This is an amazingly delicious new restaurant that is excellent for breakfast  brunch  or lunch. The chef takes great care in presentation  fresh and quality ingredients  and taste that makes you crave more! We will definitely be back to try more of his creations!', ""What a great breakfast spot. I've never had longanisa anywhere besides a traditional Philippino restaurant. It was so delicious! Not sure what brand the coffee was  but it was so much better than you usually find at resturants. Cinnamon sugar chips while you wait were such a nice surprise. The chef checked on us which is so nice to get personal service. The waitress was very attentive and nice. We can't wait to come back."", ""Thank God for Yelp or we never would have found this place.  It's in an office complex you wouldn't see from the street. \n\nVery unique and eclectic menu with an Asian flare. They have a few different types of eggs benedict. We had the soft shell crab benedict. I don't usually don't go for hollandaise sauce but theirs is light and tasty.  They have also have a huge lunch menu which I'm anxious to try the next time we come back. \n\nService was impeccable and personal and the chef checks in with every table.  Can't wait to return."", ""Such a cute place & it was super yummy. The servers were really friendly. There portions are really big & they have a variety of different kinds of foods. The chef came out to see how everyone's food was at one point & thought this was unique.  We really appreciated being greeted by him. We would love to bring people here to try it."", ""First time visit. We saw reviews on Yelp and looked good! I had the pork belly Benedict and my wife had the soft shell crab Benedict. Both were excellent! Jamie and Amanda were awesome! We'll be back!"", ""Found this place on Yelp and I'm so glad I did. The staff was so friendly  Mark was our server. We walked in and was seated right away. The place is small but very clean and trendy looking. The menu is upscale and prices are a little more than what you might want to spend on a typical breakfast but the food is worth it and not your ordinary eggs and toast. I had Green Eggs and Spam for $15  not bad at all price wise. The eggs were scrambled with green thai butter  garlic fried rice and spam.....ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! My husband had pancakes with tempura bacon  he liked the bacon but said it was a little much. It was like a pancake fried with a piece of bacon in it. He said pancakes were great. My father in law had the Triple Decker Turkey Club. He said he loved it. The turkey is real turkey  not deli meat and it's huge. Overall our bill was $51 but I would pay that again  no problem for the amount of food  quality of food and service."", ""I am a big fan of local small restaurants because we have so few memorable ones in Vegas. Served feels like a small restaurant it's easy to get behind. The chef comes out and asks how the meal was  the service is efficient and friendly and the location is where people live. Not on the strip or downtown. All pluses to me. The food goes bold. In my book that's a big plus. Even if it isn't a perfect result more restaurants need to get more creative. Too many in Vegas go for the boring  easy route. \n\nHaving said all that  I felt the vibe of the restaurant as a bit lacking. Maybe if they had a bar with a tv or a brighter decor it would help. It does feel a bit dark in there. But that's a minor criticism. \n\nCoffee is tasty and I tried the soft shell crab Benedict. I think the execution on it was excellent. It has flavor and a good crisp crab. I really enjoyed the Benedict muffin. Tasted fluffy and freshly made. I didn't love the potatoes. A bit mushy. Next time I think I'll ask if they can make them crispier and then those would be perfect. I didn't love the crab Benedict. It was a bit heavy for me. But that could a personal taste  not an indictment of the dish. I want to comeback and try a simpler dish next time. I'm hoping they have turkey sausage or something healthy I can get next time. That's the only way I could come here regularly. Definitely worth checking out!"", ""WHAT ARE THESE CINNAMON CHIPS EVERYONE SAYS THEY GOT?! I just had to get that out for a second.\n\nSo I came here around noon on a Saturday  although I'm a little disappointed I didn't get some cinnamon chips because they look tasty. Okay moving on..\n\nSo I have the huevos rancheros  but it was made with longanisa. Anyone not familiar will longanisa  it's a sweet sausage that's usually red and served for breakfast. It added a different taste and I'm a fan! Served definitely adds a twist to all of their food. \n\nThat being said  some of their breakfast plates seem kind of basic for the prices so I would probably opt for one of their more interesting plates.\n\nThe service was very attentive. Our server always kept our water glasses filled. She was very friendly. I'm definitely a fan and will be back to try more items!"", ""Wanted to try a new restaurant for breakfast/brunch today so thought we'd give Serve a try. We've eaten close to this establishment before and knew of it from driving by  and also from the Yelp reviews. \n\nWe arrived today (Saturday) around 1030'sh. It's a small restaurant  but there were seats immediately available  as opposed to our usual restaurant where we have a 30-minute to hour wait. \n\nWe were greeted with warm smiles and our waiter was nice and friendly. So far so good.\n\nThe menu has a wide variety of items to choose from. We ordered mimosas and water to start. After speaking with our waiter about what he recommends  we opted for the Barbacoa Benedict and Huevos Ranchero. We waited approximately 10-minutes for our meal. \n\nThe plates came out with food looking outstanding. Beautiful and appealing to the eye. Large portions too. Then...we took our first bite....HOLY SH$T. I would've slapped my momma the food was balls to the wall legit  delicious. The Barbacoa Benedict is out of this world. Hands down the best Benedict's I've ever had in my life. Blown. Away. The Huevos Ranchero were ri-effing-diculous. Amaze. \n\nYou know that feeling where you're torn between being pissed off because it took so long to find a gem of a restaurant  but it's so f#cking good that you're also ecstatic?!?! Yep. That was today at Served.\n\nThe chef and owner also came out while we were eating to check on everyone. Super cool guy who definitely knows his food.\n\nGo here. Eat here. Unbelievably delicious. Going back tomorrow. Cheers!"", 'Great breakfast for ppl who enjoy something different; more for foodies. Not your standard breakfast at all. Very creative flavors and the plates are beautiful.', 'Love the creative and fun approach to the menu. The concept of the restaurant involves blending the flavors of American  Filipino  Peruvian and Korean cuisine. The outcome is mostly surprising and gastronomically satisfying. The cinnamon crispy flat bread with a serving of blended Nutella and banana was a creative substitute to the traditional bread. The tacos come with a serving of rice and white beans which was tasty. I would visit this restaurant to try their food!', 'Staff was very friendly and prompt. Portions are huge and well made. The head chef even came out to greet us and ask how all the plates were. Will go back again. If u like breakfast with an Asian twist  would highly recommend.', 'Reviewing this comparatively new restaurant pains me because I want to favor owner/chef restaurants that feature innovative menus  but our experience was truly underwhelming.  I initially decided against dining here after reviewing the menu and discovering prices were relatively high  but changed my mind after reading many stellar reviews.  \n\nI had no problem locating the restaurant in the business park  but on arrival it looked to be closed at 10AM on Tuesday morning.  There is no parking immediately in front so we trudged over and tested the door which was open.  Our charming waitress said the blinds remain closed in the morning because of the heat generated from the sun.  The restaurant is very ordinary with minimal attention given to aesthetics.\n\nIn a less than surprising decision  my wife ordered the baked berry French toast (sliced bread pudding  seasonal berries  sliced almond  powdered sugar and a barbecue glaze). I initially ordered the corned beef bread pudding Benedict  but was told the kitchen was out of corned beef so my second choice was the roasted pork belly Benedict served with breakfast potatoes.  Both entrees suffered from overcooking including my eggs  sourdough crostini and potatoes. Her French toast was cut into small squares that were totally dried up even after adding syrup. \n\nThe absence of any other customers during our entire visit may suggest others have come to the conclusion that the elevated menu prices are not justified by the quality of the food.', ""Dry corned beef no hollandaise sauce. Won't be back. The waitress revommemdef the dosh. Guess they wanted to get rid of bad food."", ""So many great things to say. Food was so tasty & thoughtfully prepared. Loved the selections  generous portions!! Thanks to my husband for stepping out of his comfort zone with the same ol'  same ol'.   This place is quite a find. The menu has so many different selections I plan on coming back many times over to try them all. Hubby devoured his Wellington burger & don't leave without trying the bacon. Chef stopped by to ensure we loved our food  nice touch. And yes  we loved it!!"", ""Got here totally by accident while I was looking for a brunch place around the Henderson area. \n\nAt first sight the menu looks quite random  and because I didn't even look at the menu or photos before coming in I had no idea what to expect. \n\nIt is a 3.5 stars spot for brunch  but  I gave them 4 stars and that is why:\n\n* Service- professional  quick  to the point and very helpful. The hostess and waitress both were friendly and smiley just at the right amount. At one pitch not the chef/owner (not sure what was his position) came to check up on me- that was definitely a cool thing. \n\n* Food- it was good! Not the best Salmon Eggs Benedict  but still pretty tasty. \nThe crispy potatoes were amazing! \n\n* Presentation- The dish looked beautiful! The use very unique plates and presentation looks beautiful. One thing I didn't like as much were the petals. I Just don't think there is a need for that. \n\n* Yelp Coupon- that was a nice surprise to get 15% off just to check in. I didn't even realize that after I already checked in. \n\nCouple of things that I DIDN'T appreciate:\n\n* Ambient- definitely lacking something and I would even say boring. \n\n* Odor- unfortunately I must say that the place had a funky smell when you walk inside. Luckily for me I don't care much  and usually I'll get used to it pretty fast but there was definitely a funky smell that I didn't appreciate when I walked in. \n\n* Price- I think it's a little bit overpriced. But I guess you have to pay for that presentation!"", ""My new favorite place in town. Great service and the food was amazing. It was great to have the Chef come out and ask if we're happy with our meal. Will definitely go back. BbQ burger was amazing. Definitely recommend everyone to try it."", 'The food was amazing.

We ordered their banana foster pancakes and breakfast Tocino with fried rice and eggs. Both were pretty good but the only thing is that the tocino meat was hard to cut. However their eggs were perfectly cooked the way I like it (over medium) and their garlic fried rice was delicious.  The banana foster pancake was scrumptious and I like it that it also had the side Turon or banana fritter. Service was pretty good and the bathroom was clean. This is a small restaurant located in a small business area. Overall  we had a good experience dining here and will definitely return.', ""My family and I decided to leave the comfort of our neighborhood and trek 30 minutes to celebrate my mother's birthday at this tucked away gem. \n\nFirst thing to note is that they recently started serving dinner which was beyond amazing. The food is fresh  flavorful and extremely thoughtful. We were a party of 8 and each of us ordered something different. The steak was well prepared including the burger. My uncle had the enchiladas which he literally devoured in 5 minutes. My dad ordered the tacos with kimchi rice which he said was fresh and nicely spiced. My mother had the shrimp pasta which not only looked stunning but was cooked perfectly. \n\nNow for my dish  I ordered the Kabocha curry with rice and spring veggies. I was stingy and only allowed my mom to have a piece since after all... she's the birthday girl. The curry is fragrant and works well with the tempura fried squash and rice. I also ordered a side of kimchi which I ate on its own. \n\nThe service down to the desert and attention to detail really made tonight special. The chef and his staff are exceptionally kind and rounded out our experience. We discussed visiting again for Served's famed brunches. \n\nIf I were to describe the cuisine I'd say it's refined  culturally influenced and very thought out. There are menu options for a spectrum of foodies. \n\nThank you to the chef and his team (I forgot the name of the young lady who ran the door - she's so sweet!!) My mom really enjoyed her birthday!"", ""Finally got to try Served...quite frankly  I am not a huge fan.  We tried the soft shell crab Benedict (bleh...there wasn't alot of flavor profile here.  One bite was good  but then it was monotonous  throughout).  We also tried the miso pork belly burger.  I remembered I liked this better than the Benedict. But again  not very memorable.  I do remember that Debbie's selection  the scotch egg was unique and tasty.  We also got the fresh juice of the day.  I don't remember what it is  but I do remember that it was bland.\n\nWill I give this place another try?  Have not yet decide..."", ""The food here is indulging. Big portions  Filipino and cultural undertones. You can also find breakfast basics if you're so inclined to share your breakfast table with basic people who like French toast and things. I have tried the Huevos Rancheros and the Salmon Curry. I HIGHLY suggest the salmon curry. The edges are charred slightly  the rice is delicious and the curry is flavorful but not spicy. This dish is hearty  and has cute little vegetables along the plate. The chef always comes out to ask how your meal is-which is just lovely. They also have fresh squeezed juices. They might even have little secret fruit trees in the back. Not sure. Either way  if you're in the Hendertucky area  check this place out! The only downfall on this place is it's lack of comfort and aesthetic."", 'This is the second week I went back. I enjoyed it the first time and the second time was just as good. I tried both the french toast on the menu (one from last week and one for this week). I am actually craving for the banana french toast croissant.\nI also had the meso pork bell burger and sweet potato fries. Food are of high quality and the flavors are amazing. The owner (head chef) checks on everyone to see if the food is good and to see if everything is ok. \nI live in Summerlin and will drive to Henderson for Served.', ""This place is a laid back gem! With so many over-rated restaurants in LV it's really nice to find a spot with a young  talented chef mixing things up. (Instead of older famous chefs mailing it in). Chef Matt Meyer  is taking the best from various food cultures and putting his own spin on things. Kinda like Bruce Lee did with martial arts. \nYour meal starts with house made chips and salsa. Real good. From there feel free to explore the ever changing menu and discover your own favs!\n  If your a fan of eggs benny then you'll love the hollandaise sauce. Fusian?

The crab was perfectly crispy (not greasy) and light which complemented the miso hollandaise and eggs perfectly. We'll definitely be back!"", ""Matthew & I arrived at Served after a somewhat rough morning. Being a 23 year old female  I just can't help my mood swings but somehow I can always be pacified with a nice breakfast & an absurd amount of coffee. \n\nMake sure you have Google Maps up & running when you set out on your breakfast journey because this place is a little tucked away. Located behind a doctors office in a somewhat empty center  we wondered whether anyone would be home when we got there. Don't let its remote location turn you off though. Once inside  we were greated warmly and seated in a quaint spot by the window. The decor is simple  yet elegant and modern and the service was timely and efficient. \n\nThe menu itself was unique to say the least. My craving for breakfast food drew us in  but we quickly switched our focus to lunch when the menu revealed that all their items have an Asian twist to them. \n\nI ordered Papusas and Matthew ordered the Corn Beef Hash. The food was beautifully prepared and the ingredients were fresh  but we came to grub on some good food and unfortunately the meal was better on the eyes then in the tummy. \n\nAs pretty as it looked  both meals were rather bland and lacked any sort of distinct flavor. The beef on my papusa was slightly overcooked & therefore a bit dry and its accompanying coleslaw lacked the spice & flavor that typically gives this dish its wow factor. \n\nMatthew's hash was good but not great. The hash itself consisted of a rye bread concoction (or so it tasted) as the hash  and a minimal amount of beef. As a real CBH lover  he was hungry enough to eat it all  but not thrilled enough to come back. \n\nI'd say this place is worth a visit depending on what you look for in a restaurant. If good service & presentation is high up on your list of requirements  check it out. If you're a food connoisseur with a perfect palate  a different breakfast joint might better suit your fancy."", 'Great restaurant. Varied menu reasonably priced. Outstanding service. Chef visited table. Had Banana croissant French toast that was amazing. Will return to this hidden neighborhood find.', ""The food is amazing! The items on the menu allow you to explore famous dishes around the world in just one restaurant. We ordered the Longsilog  Crispy Baked Berry French Toast  the Huevos Rancheros  the Softshell Crab Benedict  mimosas and coffee. Every dish was absolute perfection  and the mimosas were very light and bubbly. There were 2 Filipinos and a Mexican in the group and we were all very happy!! The one thing I was unhappy about was the decaf coffee. My decaf tasted bitter  so much that I asked for another cup. Unfortunately  it was still bitter  so I couldn't enjoy a cup of decaf. I tasted my friend's regular cup of coffee and hers was not bitter  so it must be in the decaf coffee they chose. Please fix the decaf blend  because then it would have been the best breakfast ever!!

We decided to choose Served over Kitchen Table because neither of us had been there before.\nOur waitress was pleasant. We tried the Roasted Pork Belly Benedict. There wasn't much pork on it  and the pork that was on it had lots of fat. It was served with potatoes  which were kind of cold. \nWe also tried the Bi Bim Ba. Nothing to write home about. The rice was hard and crunchy. So much so  that we asked the waitress if we could hair have fresh rice. We know that fried rice is usually made with old rice  but it made it almost inedible. \n\nThere was nothing that made me want to come back. A little overpriced  and the food wasn't all that great. And since portions are small  you kind of leave feeling hungry. \n\nI am glad I tried it out though  because I like to try small businesses."", ""So we live in the neighborhood and finally decided to try this place.  We came at about 10:30 on a Thursday  so the place was not very busy.  The decor is simple and rather cheap.  The prices on the menu seemed rather high for a breakfast/lunch place.  Our expectations  at that point  were not very high.\n\nWhat a surprise!!!!  The food was the best we had in the neighborhood and we have other places that are fairly good.  What's more  the portion sizes were large.  I had the pork belly bahn mi and it was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.  It had a good amount of pork belly and quick pickled vegetables that were still crunchy the way I like them.  My wife had the bread pudding and she couldn't stop raving about it.  The balance of flavors was clearly superior.  It was large enough for 2 or 3 meals.\n\nNow you have to understand that I rarely rate food places high because I am an amateur chef.  My wife has not liked ANY restaurant since we moved here last year and she is very difficult to please.  She loved it.\n\nThe chef came out and we spoke to him.  There are several items on the menu I'd like to try.  I prefer out-of-the box creations especially with an ethnic touch and there is a lot for me to try.  They have a large burger menu and their burgers are made with ground short rib meat.  That's one I have to try.\n\nThey do have a limited staff so I would imagine service will be slow if there are a lot of customers.  Everything is made on the spot so it is extremely fresh.  That will take some time so don't come here if you are in a rush or have small children who aren't patient.  Also  if ambiance is your thing  try elsewhere.  But if you come to a restaurant for the food  this is one of the best places you can try."", ""First  the staff is very friendly and our lovely waitress took care of our every need. Good luck if you're an indecisive eater because every thing sounded so good! I ended up ordering the Pork Belly Benedict and the thai hollandaise sauce was killer! YOU MUST TRY THE BACON.. I am excited to go back and try all of the other items on the menu that caught my attention."", 'After reading great reviews  my friend and I decided to eat Saturday brunch.  Perhaps it was because we highly anticipated the friendly customer service and unforgettable food that others on Yelp described  we were so deeply disappointed.  It was hard to find though we have lived in the area over 15 years.  Tucked away in a multiple strip mall  the signage and exterior are minimal and the interior was bland.  The long narrow room with beige walls reminded me of a place you go to get blood tests. \n \nThere was only one other customer  who left after looking at the menu. The waitress  Amanda was very nice and helped us understand the menu.  She said it was the last day for that menu  it was being completely changed the next day.  This should have warned us  but we laughingly asked for items that were going to be carried over to the new menu thinking we would get the best.  WRONG.\n\n We ordered The Wellington burger and pork belly Bernaise.  Despite the lack of customers it took a long time for the food to get to the table.  My friends burger was medium  not medium rare  and the sweet potatoe fries were dried out and over salted. I did not taste the Bernaise on my eggs  because the pork belly pieces (laying on the side of a hot stone which served as a plate) were shriveled and not even hot to the touch. And the tater tots were burned. Amanda apologized and took it away. Since we had not been served at the same time  I had a bite of my friends burger and decided to order one as a replacement. Amanda came back to the table to tell us the fryer was broken now and Fries were not available. She then said the chef would make us a complimentary dessert.  When I bit into the burger it was very well done  though I ordered medium rare. I couldn\'t eat it either.  At this point the Chef came to the table and dropped a creme brûlée plate on the table saying ""here is the dessert YOU requested"".  We had not! Small blueberries and 1/2 of a strawberry was on one section of the top and the rest covered in whipped cream.* He immediately began telling us we should not have complained  that even though he didn\'t eat this kind of food.  ( He said he ate ""clean"")  customers raved about the dishes we ordered.  He was clearly angry and not interested in hearing our opinions.  In fact  he said it was our opinion not the general consensus.  After 5 minutes of bickering  he left and Amanda brought us the bill minus the cost of my burger.  We left a 40% tip for the waitress but regretted the gesture because the chef would get the wrong idea.  So  this is the reason for this review. We want to spare anyone else that is looking to have a meal were their tastes are of concern...and frankly where the chef is proud enough to eat the food he cooks. Overcooks!\n\n*After Chef left   we found why...the top was not carmelized..it was black (burnt) and disguised by the fruit and whipped cream.

My meal had so many savory and unique flavors  which I love  that the drink was a nice way to calm it down. \n\nThe creme brûlée flavor of the day was an orange cream and summed up my meal perfectly. Not to sweet  just right! The fresh oranges on top was a nice touch. It is a good size to share and since I was so full I couldn't finish it myself. \n\nI wish I had a bigger tummy to try everything on the menu  but that will have to wait for my next visit. Instead  I got some food to go for my lunch tomorrow! \n\nI love the fusion flavors of this resturant and it looks like there is something for everyone.

Our last refill of coffee was the bottom of the coffee pot  so it was pretty much grinds and 1/2 a cup. After sitting around for over 40 mins and seeing how other tables (table of 4  table of 2 and a table of 1) that sat down after us get their food... we decided to ask about food. Our waitress\'s response was ""I asked for your food"" and shrugged. That\'s when we decided that we can\'t wait any longer. We asked for our check and left.

Salty  spicy  sweet  sour--a perfect balance of flavors. I think about this dish CONSTANTLY. The soft shell crab eggs benedict was also excellent. The miso hollandaise was a surprisingly subtle sauce. I appreciated that it was different from the standard hollandaise but wished it had a more distinctive miso flavor. \n\nService was fine  except our server was unclear on gluten free items on the menu (we had a gluten allergy in our group).

I like spam  but the dish.. is it worth the amount they\'re charging it for? No. Again  it\'s Spam. The Thai butter is a nice touch on the eggs though. \n\nThe Chicken wings? Nice taste. Again  worth the price? Probably not. $7 maximum  easily at a local Hawaiian or Korean spot. \n\nBiggest disappointment would probably be the soft shell crab tempura.

After we got our drinks we were told a server will be by to take our food order. Add on another 15 minutes before someone came back. The menu has very interesting options. The food was the best part of our experience. The food was delicious and very tasty. The presentation also was appealing to the eyes. Overall the customer service was horrible.

We started off with the tempura fried cheese appetizer followed by soft shell crab Benedict for me and shirt rib Benedict for my son. We each had a glass of fresh watermelon juice. The fried cheese took forever to come out of the kitchen. In that time we drank our watermelon juice. It was pricy but good. It was a warm day so I ordered another along with water. I kid you not we asked the server at least 5 times over a period of 15 mins about our drinks. Our appetizer finally came out and still no drinks after asking again. Then the entrees arrived and finally we were given our drinks. Thank goodness we had a drink to wash down the food. It was t very good at all. The short rib Benedict was a big messy slop of a plate. There were so many mushrooms on it that you couldn't distinguish the mushrooms from the meat. Everyone knows that mushrooms hold a lot of water. Apparently everyone except this chef. The entire plate was soaked. The dish was completely inedible.  My sons soft shell crab Benny looked good. One bite and we both spit it out. The crab was not fresh. It had a very fishy taste and did not smell right. The waiter never returned to check on us to even see how it was. At this point we were just done and pushed our plates away. The chef began making rounds and arrived at our table. He clearly saw we did not touch our food. He asked if something was wrong to which I told him the food just wasn't good. He looked at me almost with an offended look and said what's not good about it. We weren't even going to say anything and just chalk it up to trying some new food at a new restaurant. However the chefs demeanor compelled me to tell him what a sloppy mess my item was. I then told him he needed to check his crab before someone gets sick because it was bad. He never offered to redo the food or offer something in its place. He said well I'm sorry you feel that way and walked away. The worst part was getting stuck with a bill of almost $70 for brunch and walking out of there still hungry. We will NEVER be back."", ""Lomo Saltado was really delicious. The chips with the different dips are also amazing. Their curry is also delicious  just spicy enough to feel it  however 25 dollars for the chicken substitution is egregious. A chicken panang curry at even the best Thai restaurants maxes out at 15 dollars  and it's not like they gave us a double portion. I hope the owner takes a look at this and fixes the pricing.

Chef Matt attempted to open for dinner a couple of months ago.  He served dishes ranging from salmon to steak. I had the opportunity to try most of his dinner entrees and all were on point.

We don't travel out to Hendertucky very often so this was a nice find. Their menu primarily features Asian fusion breakfast and lunch cuisine  which was a bit unexpected in this neck of the woods. The one knock about this spot is their menu prices are overpriced for what they offer. I'm talking about $20-30 for Benedicts  which are Strip prices for a way off-the-Strip location. But  other than that  the food was great.\n\nFor breakfast  we shared the pork lumpia ($9) and I got the longsilog ($13) and Wendy N. got the Korean spicy pork bulgogi Benedict ($14). The food was great  and I loved the lumpia  which tasted slightly different than typical lumpia. My Filipino breakfast was just how I liked it  three longanisa links with plenty of garlic fried rice  3 sunny side up eggs with garlic & vinegar sauce. The downside? Again  the price  which could've been had for more or less the same flavor and portion size at Grill City for $4. The Benedict was good and we loved that they used rice cakes instead of English muffins.\n\nThe best part of this meal? The complimentary house-made sweet and spicy tortilla chips. Holy crap  these are addicting. Believe me when I say these are good enough for me to return for."", ""I noticed this place a couple weeks ago & checked out the menu that was on Yelp and today we decided to try it  not knowing it was opening day. And apparently it's 50% off thru Mother's Day! \n\nThe service from Joe was great! Our food was delicious  especially the bacon which we found out from chef that he cooks it with brown sugar. Only negative thing was it took forever but worth the wait. They have a great menu selection so can't wait to try stuff on the lunch menu. \n\nThe decor is nice but I think they should change the flooring. The carpet gives it a banquet hall feel."", 'We ordered the mango unsweetened iced tea  short rib chili cheeseburger with sweet potato fries  and the bahn mi sandwich. The sandwiches were plated on slate - very contemporary and chic. The food is delicious and service friendly. The menu is intriguing ... we will be back! Awesome choice.', 'I spent the weekend in Las Vegas  Henderson to be exact. We stopped at Served (as it was the only place that seemed to be still serving breakfast after 3:00pm in the city) and came across a goldmine. The service was amazing and the food was even better.  We were sat right away. The place was very clean and quiet and we were told we had just missed the afternoon rush (it was a Friday afternoon).  Our waiter was friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu. He said  ""Everything is good  honestly"" and he was not lying one bit.  I ordered the Crispy Berry French Toast with a side of eggs  bacon and breakfast potatoes. My husband ordered the Tempura Bacon Pancake Breakfast and my sons ordered the Fried Chicken and Cornbread French Toast Breakfast and the Longslog Breakfast (all pictured). EVERYTHING was delicious. And I\'m talking that bite it and take a deep breath delicious. I definitely plan to return every time I\'m in the area.', ""We came here for brunch. The breakfast potato's here are off the charts.

I say go here for sure."", ""Just stopped by this place today for lunch cause it had good reviews on yelp. Good atmosphere  place was almost empty . I ordered wild salmon dish and didn't even eat it. Was way to spicy and even tasted bitter . Definitely overpriced place ! For 25$ I got a small dish full of only souse and some bitter veggies . They say vegetables are organic that's why it is so expensive. Chef-owner asked if the food was good I said I didn't like it  he wasn't friendly and was trying to prove the point that the food was good and salmon is always that fat and oily and may be I just never tried salmon before that's why I can't compare . He wasn't going to deduct the dish from the check saying that he can't cancel the dish just because I'm a bad customer. My mood was ruined for the day"", ""We were looking for a place new to us for brunch  and we're glad we tried Served. Everything  literally everything  was absolutely delicious.

We will definitely be back!', ""Thought I would update my review for Served since I've been back twice and WOW'd both times.\nMy first time back I had seen another patron with the baked berry French toast so I wanted it....badly. I tried to get it on Memorial Day but they were closed  so a week later I snuck away from work to devour this sweet and sexy meal. It did not disappoint. This might be the best french toast I've ever eaten in my life!! The toast itself had a crunchy outside with a soft middle  baked strawberries and blueberries all over it  lots of sliced almonds..and topped with a frangelico syrup. OMG! I will order this again and again and again. \n\n2nd trip back I brought a friend. He had a special Peruvian dish not on the menu whose name I'll never remember  and I had the Pork Belly Miso burger. Chef Matt explained that he liked this Peruvian dish so he tried to emulate it  and it came out great. See photos. I snuck a couple bites from my friend and it was delish! My Pork Belly Miso burger was HUGE and cooked to perfection. The pork belly taste was a little hidden by the beef flavor (I love the marinated pork belly here) and it was juicy and a bit messy to eat. I could only down 1/2 the burger along with the side of sweet potato fries. I loved the flavors.\n\nI'll be back because I love this place and the menu has so many things I enjoy eating. Its going to be hard to try them all because of that baked berry French Toast though....I might be in love."", ""I love Korean food  and I love this place since it's a marriage of American and Korean cuisine. The establishment itself is on the smaller side and it was pretty packed when I came on the weekend  so be prepared to wait a little if you come at a busy time. \n\nThe wait is definitely worth it  since the food here is packed with flavor  and the service is super quick. I got the Korean Spicy Pork Bulgogi Benny  and it was an explosion of flavor in my mouth. The bulgogi was equally sweet and spicy and succulent and was topped on a mochi- like rice patty. I highly recommend it. My partner got the omelet  and loved it also. I loved the complimentary chips with salsa (the crisps was very well seasoned). \n\nI enjoyed everything here except for the the Kimchi Galbi Fries because they were overly sweet. The fries themselves were sweet (sweet potato fries)  and they were topped with a saccharin white sauce and a kimchi sauce. I felt like I was eating sauce with a side of fries. This dish could work for others  just not for me. \n\nServed is a a millennial and foodie friendly joint that has unique fusion comfort food sure to please any taste. I'm looking forward to coming back here to try more."", ""I'm not usually one to revisit restaurants  but the menu at Served has me wanting to try everything they offer. I've been here multiple times for both breakfast and lunch  and they have never failed to disappoint. The reasonable prices and plain decor are not at all indicative of the quality and quantity of dishes. Their fusion-style dishes (Asian  American and Peruvian) are inspired and generously proportioned. The always-friendly staff are attentive and clearly enjoy working there  making the experience an assured delight."", 'Had a great breakfast this morning. Everyone was so nice there  service was exceptional. My hubby had corned beef hash and I had a Korean bulgolgi Bennie. The eggs cooked perfectly They have great coffee.

We came across this place by accident while we were waiting for our table at the trendy Kitchen Table restaurant which is in the same plaza. What a wonderful case of serendipity!

Coke products by the can \nSome beer by the bottle .\nFriendly service', ""Food was fantastic. We had the berry French toast and the bam slam. Bacon was thick and flavorful  Pancakes fluffy but crisp on the outside  and the potatoes were crisp and seasoned. It's a smaller place  kinda dark  and pretty busy. Took a long time to checkout because of the lunch crowd filing in and the backup at the computer. But our waitress was kind and kept checking in. Oh  the chef also came out to check on the tables during our meal. I think that's cool and shows the pride he has in his place. We will be back and would recommend it :)"", 'Thanks to Yelp we found Served and stopped in for breakfast. Served is located at Horizon Ridge/Valle Verde in the back of the office complex. We arrived just after 9:00 and were the only two there until just before we left. The menu at Served is multi cultural with Filipino  Spanish and Asian influences. After seeing pictures of the berry french toast I had to order it! The food did not come out until about 9:35  almost 30 minutes after we ordered. It was far too long a wait for being the only two in the restaurant. \n\nChef/owner Matt brought the food out and apologized for the wait. The berry french toast was nicely presented with berries  sliced almonds and whipped cream. As Matt explained  the french toast starts off as a bread pudding which makes it so delicious. \n\nHe also uses several different types of bread which mixes up the flavors and textures. The side of potatoes we ordered were also fantastic. Nice and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The food was 5 stars. Matt came back to see how we liked it and explained his cooking style and made sure we were happy with the food. I will definitely be returning soon to try out his lunch items.', ""I love to brunch and I can say this is one of the tastiest breakfasts I've ever had. Such unique flavors and I savored every bite. I had the tempura apple pancakes and it had a perfect balance of tartness to sweetness  plus the crunchy tempura texture with the softness of the cooked apples and pancakes.... Literally my mouth is watering just thinking about it again. \n\nAll of their menu options sound delicious and my sister's mushroom Benedict was also amazing. It is definitely pricier than most of the brunch spots I've been to but at least you leave with your tummy happy and your palette surprised and satisfied.

It's super cute. \n\nWe came in as they opened so we were the only ones there. The girl working  Cassandra  was the sweetest! She kept the mimosas coming and was very attentive and fun. Basically  the service was amazing. \n\nThe menu actually surprised me. I wasn't expecting such a wide variety. I wanted everything on the menu. But of course  I went with a Filipino breakfast.

I compliment the chef 100% .. \n\nSadly the service is what gives this place such a low rating  from me at least. Our Server  tall gentleman  had no personality. He wouldn't smile nor did he greet us upon arrival. I'm very observant of my surroundings when I go anywhere  and one thing I did notice was how unfriendly he was towards our table. I noticed him greet everyone else and laugh with certain customers  but he obviously didn't seem to want to extend the same courtesy towards us. Aside from the lack of customer service  our glasses of water  were just that. Glasses of empty water decorating the table. They were rarely filled. Mind you the restaurant was not packed  mayber one or two tables besides ours. At one point my friend asked for a refill and they only refilled the cup half way. Laughable. \n\nFood took forever  waited about 1.5hrs .. At this point more customers had arrived and were fed and on their way long after we arrived  but way before we received our meals ( 4 tables total - I kept track ) .. but we forgive the chef  because like I said  the food was pretty good and he graciously came out to greet and ensure we had received all our entrees and to ask if everything was okay with our meals. \n\nI've worked in the customer service industry .. food/hotel/retail .. for years and I pride myself in ensuring that whomever I am assisting in that moment  that when they leave me  they've left satisfied. ( I've dealt with pain in the ass idiot customers ) but even I've always kept my game face on. And we were far from the closest pain in the ass anything. \n\nI've never left a table without showing my gratitude. Sadly this time I did. \n\nBut once more  food was very tasty.

Although we got seated right away  the remainder of the our experience was shitty. We waited a long time for our food  at least 45 minutes after ordering. \n\nFirst off  we never got our Cinnamon Chips and our server forgot my beverage order which was only a mango iced tea. There was three of us dining and we ordered a Filipino breakfast and two orders of braised beef short ribs Benedict. The Filipino Breakfast was served 15 minutes before the Benedict\'s. (Courses should be ""Served"" in a timely fashion in which all guests at the same table should be served the same course at the same time). Keep in mind that the restaurant was NOT BUSY but somehow  Several People came in after us and they got served before us. Still don\'t understand why our food took so long as they never provided an explanation. As we got our meals  I noticed that the serving PORTIONS ARE SMALL and was OVERPRICED.  I never got my toast that was supposed to come with my meal and the short ribs on the Benny were mostly fat and grease  barely any meat. \n\nAfter we finished eating  Matt (the Chef)  did his table touches and ask us how everything us. We simply responded ""alright"" with disappointed looks on our faces. The chef asked what was wrong and we responded that the short ribs were way too fatty.  Matt responded sarcastically and said  ""have you had short ribs before?"" I was so annoyed with his ""smart-ass"" question and didn\'t expect that from the chef who runs the joint. So unprofessional. For your information Matt  Yes we have had short ribs many times before at other restaurants and have had better quality than the crap that you served!  After getting the bill  they only comped one beer for a merely $6 for the shitty service we had. \n\nOverall  our experience was horrible. Service was slow  portions were small  meals are overpriced and the chef is a True Asshole. They should really think about changing their restaurant name as ""the SERVED"" doesn\'t suit them at all. The restaurant is located in a random office location and trying to be a classy restaurant. So Lame!! I don\'t understand how there are so many good reviews. Unfortunately  yelp requires that I rate at least one star when it should be No Stars. I would never recommend this restaurant.', 'Had an amazing lunch.

The length of the place created a consistent flow of air from entrance to exit that even being a bit warm  the fans kept everyone cool. Every meal that landed on our table was cooked to utter perfection. Both for the eyes and our mouths. First visit I ordered the green eggs and spam  with the the caption ""thai butter"" reeling me in. The thai spice added to the egg was beyond words. Matched with the garlic rice it was orgasmic. Just about everyone at the table ordered some form of pancake and their plates made my own mouth water. Second visit we went for burgers and fish tacos  both of which were complete perfection. Not sure I\'ve tasted a better burger than my roomate\'s but theirs just oozed mouthwatering taste. Going to try getting through the menu--wish us luck!', 'LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE! HOW DARE DOES ONE OF YOUR EMPLOYEES CALL MY GROUP OF FRIENDS AND I GHETTO?! ( screenshots)\nI\'m not one to post a 1 Star review. Let me start by saying that the chef was very hands on and the food was great but the waitress was very disconnected. Not fully invested in our table  kept apologizing for her mistakes. We let it slide because we understand people make mistakes. We get it. Now here is where it went south  our waitress accidentally charged my friends card an extra $80.00 from another customers tab (which takes about 24hrs to be refunded)on top of her own bill. This was the last straw. We understand that people make mistakes that wasn\'t our issue. Our issue was the way it was handled. No type of consideration for my friends inconvenience. They were very nonchalant about the whole thing kept saying it will be refunded in 24 hrs. Okay? That\'s not the problem  the problem is that the $80 dollars is still pending in her account for 24 hrs. What about scheduled payments that she had already or other plans for the rest of her day? Eventually they gave her a compensation for her meal after we insisted for some type of discount for her troubles. \nThe moment that one of us share our experience here on Yelp (that\'s what yelp is for)  one of the employees named MANNY decided to take it upon himself to call us GHETTO?! And question our livelihood. Apparently according to him because we prayed before our meal we should not share our  negative experience on here ""IT\'S NOT THE CHRISTIAN WAY"" what does that have to do with anything?! The fact that you called us out of our name and called us hypocrites is beyond me. How dare you treat paying customers this way? We decided to use our hard earned money to eat here and this is what happens just because we asked for some type of compensation for our troubles?? I\'ve never been disrespected like this in my life!! Now  I don\'t want to make this a race issue but I am going to ask if 3 of my friends weren\'t black would we still be called ghetto? Or would we be called complicated customers?\nUnfortunately  you lost 4 customers who truly enjoyed your mimosas and food. \nI\'m in no way bashing the business I believe In supporting small business before I give my service to a big food chain restaurant  but this is unacceptable!

Served with a side of beans and Thai fried rice. \nthe other dish I had was the Bi Bim Ba. marinated flank steak  different vegetables that have a kimchee taste with a poached egg and rice topped with hot sauce.

I was almost surprised that they weren't as busy when I called ahead on a Sunday morning. Even so  I can see Served becoming ever more popular based on food alone  and if this place isn't on your list of go-to's for brunch  it should be.\n\nThe waiters/waitresses are so inviting and friendly that you feel like you're part of a community of sorts. The chef came out and introduced himself to every table  and I think it's the small things like this that make you want to come back and bring all your friends.\n\nAfter you order and are just waiting for the food  you get some complimentary snacks. You know how Mexican restaurants give you chips and salsa or how an Italian restaurant gives you bread and olive oil? Well Served goes one step further and gives you cinnamon sugar chips and a Nutella dip. The dip itself is pretty light and gives you just enough of that chocolate hazelnut flavor without feeling like you're dipping the entire thing in a jar of Nutella. \n\nWe got the Roasted Pork Belly Benedict and the BAM Slam with blueberry pancakes. The BAM Slam was perfect. The breakfast potatoes aren't your average deep fried/dry potatoes. They have a crisp exterior and a soft  warm interior. They definitely have a heft to them. If you're not careful (like me)  you'll eat all the potatoes first  get full  and realize that you still haven't tried the rest of your food. First world problem  I know. The bacon is thick cut and has a little sweetness to it. The pancakes were fluffy and cooked well. The roasted pork belly benedict was really well prepared as well. All the flavors balanced very well.\n\nOverall  the food is incredibly well prepared  the service is amazing  and you most likely won't be disappointed when you come here.""]"

I'd been looking forward to trying their hotdogs since I heard about their opening!\n\nI went with a Sonoran...  and I've got to say it was lacking.

Just think of all of those wasted opportunities. This place serves hot dogs in a way that is gourmet and satisfying. I had to try two of these amazing dogs on my first trip. I opted for the coney island dog and the dog of the day - I think it was called the urban cowboy"". Both of these were full of flavor. The hot dogs had a nice snap  and the buns were grilled to perfection. I opted for the fries  but I cannot wait to go back and try their ""famous"" onion rings in the near future. Don\'t waste an opportunity and pass this place like I did so many times. You will find the food unique  flavorful  and fun!', ""I just moved to Charlotte about a year ago and I have been dying to eat at JJ's! I finally did this past weekend and boy  was I impressed! \n\nFirst of all  for a hot dog joint you would think it would be a hole in the wall or a cart on the side of the road. JJ's had a retro  old but fun feeling inside. It was super clean and very welcoming! They even have a rooftop seating area for when its nice out  which is almost all the time in Charlotte! \n\nI got the Char-Heel combo (House-made Chili  Slaw  Diced Onions  Yellow Mustard on the hot dog  fries and a soda). At first  I was skeptical of having all those crazy ingredients on a hot dog  I'm a plain hot dog and ketchup person but it was the most delicious combination on a hot dog I have ever had! Side note - If you are from New York and you know anything about garbage plates  get this hot dog! It tastes exactly like a garbage plate!!! And on top of how delicious this all was  it's only 7 dollars! \n\nThe employees were all very kind. The woman at the register helped me to pick out which hot dog I wanted  she was very patient when we asked questions and very helpful. The boy who delivered our meals was funny and willing to do what it took to make us happy customers. \n\nFYI - Thursday's are 6 dollar all you can eat hot dog bar! I will most definitely be going back for this sometime soon! \n\nDefinitely check JJ's out  its worth it! I know I'll be back soon!"", 'I have a problem. I sometimes get a really bad craving for hot dogs. Up to now  I\'ve been out of luck in Charlotte. I mean  there\'s the great Matt\'s Chicago Dogs but it\'s in Uptown and it\'s a hassle to park. So when the craving happened  I went to Yelp and it brought me to JJ\'s.\n\nFiguring I would start right at the top of the menu  I chose the ""Number One"" which comes with hot relish  onions  mustard and a pickle spear. It was a good choice. Nice amount of toppings and the bun was perfectly toasted. Don\'t get me wrong  I\'m usually a ""boiled"" wiener rather than a ""roasted"" weiner kind of guy  but there\'s just something to be said about that charred flavor! (Next time  I\'ll read Ben\'s review and try peanut butter  sriracha  and bacon.)\n\nI also got a side of onion rings (thank you  Yelp check-in offer). Thin rings of onion coated with batter and fried. Not the thick ones I usually see. These actually tasted of onion. And fried batter.

Maybe the slaw?\n\nSoda fountain  tea urns (I mixed some unsweet into the very sweet tea) and some bottled drinks.

There is  however  outside seating on the roof which is nice as well. The staff was friendly and served the food promptly.  \n\nI ordered the char hill which was extremely good!! It\'s the standard hot dog (homemade chilli  slaw  mustard  and onions).  They loaded my hot dog with mustard  so if you\'re not fond of it  please take heed or tell them light mustard.  My dog costs only 3.99 which is reasonable to me because of the quality!  I\'ve also had JJ\'s No. 1 ""red hot"" which was great as well and has a little kick to it.  For this hot dog (and many others) there is a vegetarian option available.

They were very flexible with the coupon as well. They have a variety of seating areas to choose from.. Indoor AC area  some patio seating on the ground floor and a rooftop patio. After you place your order you take a number with you to your table and the food is brought out to you.

Cool selection of side items and they have king of pops which is always a plus"", '2nd time visiting the restaurant  I liked it a lot more this time. Got the Chili Cheese Coney. Could have used some more chili but hotdogs were over bun size.  Fries were good.  Good spot for lunch or for casual hangouts.', ""JJ's caught me by surprise and I couldn't be more excited.  If you haven't visited  you need to make it a point to check out this new hotspot.\n\nLet me first start out by saying I have always been a little bias on my hotdog cravings.  For the past decade  I've loved Chicago dogs moreso than the Carolina style.  I did grow up in Statesville in the 80s and there was a place called Elliott's Old Fashioned Ice Cream and their ice cream and hot dogs were insanely great and memorable.  It was a classic soda shop feel and was very 50's.  It since closed after the owners passed away and I've been disappointed 95% of the Carolina dogs that I've had.  Enter  JJ's.\n\nMy wife got the Char Heel and Homemade Chips w/ Ranch.  I got the Chicago Dog with Onion Rings.  I ended with a Chocolate Shake and she had a nice import beer as their selection is great for this type of spot.\n\nMy Chicago Dog was fantastic and I have to say they have the edge in flavor over Matt's Chicago Dog.  That floored me.  The relish isn't the noteable bright green buy the flavor was fantastic.  Now  the Char Heel.  This is the best Carolina-Style hotdog that I have had since 1995ish.  As soon as I took a bite of this magnificent hotdog and it had that perfect snap  the flavors of the onions  chili and mustard sent me back.  Yep  I'm a little intense with this one but it's just that good.  The flavor was perfectly balanced and it brought me back to my youth.  \n\nThis is located next to Lebowski's and the businesses that tend to go in here don't last long.  They have a great parking lot now and a rooftop patio so I'm hoping people take advantage of this place.  I know I'll be doing my part in hope they stay strong."", ""My husband and I love this place. We love the prices (very reasonable)  the atmosphere (very laid back  come-as-you-are) and  of course  the food! (Delicious hot dogs  bratwurst  sausages  etc.)\n\nThis is a great place to stop in if you're an adventurous eater or a lover of the plane Jane staples  JJ's has you covered either way. My favorite are the Chicago and the Philly style dogs. They also have delicious tater tots and a very respectable side salad for a hot dog place. Complete with legitimate veggies like cucumbers and carrots. \n\nWe've been twice and we'll be back again and again I'm sure."", ""This place is awesome! Definitely sit outside if it's nice out...hard to beat the rooftop!"", ""I won't dive too deep into the aesthetics of the place since others have covered it well  but suffice it to say the place looks great and the patio upstairs is a nice place to enjoy some tube-steak...As for the edibles  they're serving Sahlen's hotdogs from NY  which are solid.  They're not huge  but they're quality so that's what counts.  (They do serve the same brand next door at Lebowski's) They have the obligatory selection of pre-designed topping dogs  and sausages  as well as some other munchies like chips and salads  but we didn't try any of those.  You can also build your own dogs too if you want.  They also have an all you can eat hot dog buffet sometimes  and it was only $5 so if you can hit that up  it's a crazy deal. I think I had 6 the last time we went  so you can get your money's worth!  All in all  a cool vibe  if a little pricey  but I think it's worth it."", ""Ate there for the first time yesterday and will definitely go back. I had the 2 dog combo with J J's Bratwurst and Southern Girl. J J's Bratwurst was very good  but Southern Girl was outstanding! Best hotdog I have ever had. Staff was friendly and helpful with descriptions and recommendations."", ""I was actually disappointed after visiting this place. I had heard so many good things about this place by the time I tasted my food I wondered if I had the wrong location. I had a chili cheese dog that somehow pretty bland. The fries were fine. The service was okay. I did like the design on the inside though. The hot dogs are Vienna style  which is much different than Nathan's which is what I usually prefer. I don't see myself going out of the way to go back like I did before."", ""This is a popular place with locals to satisfy the urge to have a good hot dog.  The only problem is choosing which one you want as the choices for dogs and side items are considerable.  It was quite crowded as it was Fathers' Day and all dads got a free hot dog.  Thanks to my son's girl friend  we had coupons to use also.  Your order and payment is taken at the counter.  You are given a number  find a place to sit and your food is delivered to your table.   There's a pickle bar and next time  I plan on seeing what that is all about. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Cheerwine is on the drink menu.  I live in PA and it is not available.  \n  Great place to stop by."", ""They have made the hot dog an art form. The flavors they build  and the creativity they use is top notch.

They were sitting on the counter and I was told they had forgotten about them and apologized.  I took the beers and went back on the roof.  In a few minutes two delicious hotdogs and fries arrived  I aske for a napkin ans the server directed me to downstairs  so I went and got napkins.  We ate the hot dogs and half way thru ran out of beer  no server in sight  and I had laready closed out my cc  so we finished our hot dogs and fries  and left heading somewhere else for a beer and an appetizer.\n\nBeverages are the cash cow  had we had a server on the roof we would have ordered more dogs and more beer.

That's a treat for parents so we can use that extra money for beer! ;)\n\nLove the king of pops too & the staff here is very friendly."", ""My first visit here though I've been hearing about their legendary hot dogs for years. Not having one close by my neighborhood was my excuse. Now I know a trip with JJ's as a destination is worth the journey! I was amazed at all of the choices other than hot dogs.  Options included sandwiches and salads as well as some vegan dishes. A wide selection of beer was available also. Back to the hot dogs though I ordered the very popular Char dog with chili onions and slaw period for my side I had the incredible onion rings thinly sliced and crusty. The atmosphere was friendly and the staff was welcoming. We ordered at the counter and our food was brought to us within minutes. I definitely plan to go back on one of their Tuesday afternoons after 3:00 when they serve $2 hot dogs and $2 beer. What a great deal for a week night after work!"", 'Lunch there today.

Woot!\n\nThis place serves up one of my guilty pleasures.. Hot dogs.  And not just your run-of-the-mill boring things stuck in a bun.  No  they do it right.  They GRILL their dogs.  If you ask them to boil one  they will be highly offended.  And  if you smile and ask nicely  (and are weird like me) they\'ll even burn one for you.  It\'s on the short list of my favorite things.. a charred (almost black) hot dog.  Maybe I was dropped on my head early in life  I don\'t know  I have no explanation.  But JJ\'s did it for me.  And it was glorious!\n\nThey have great toppings  yummy milkshakes  and good fries.  I also tried their onion rings  but I wasn\'t that crazy about them.  Let\'s face it  I was there for the dog.\n\nThey also have some ""higher end"" items  like a salmon sausage and other \'brat\' type things.  We really enjoyed our visit.

We both had the Chili Cheese Coney and the dog itself has a lot more flavor than the typical dog. They grill it right there and the chili and cheese are very well balanced. The onion rings are terrific.

That\'s fine.  That\'s his prerogative.  Now it\'s my prerogative to never visit JJ\'s again  not only for the items mentioned in my review  but for his unprofessionalism as a business owner.  \n\nHe feels that I should reward his workers going above and beyond their regular duty.  To me  that\'s just called doing a great job.  I  too  go -- and have gone -- above and beyond in all of my jobs -- retail  restaurants  offices.  It\'s who I am.  I don\'t expect a tip for treating someone extra special or making their day.  Just doing it is reward enough.  Plus  I\'m already being paid to provide good service by my employer(s).  That\'s why I was hired.\n\nJonathan also wanted to ""explain"" to me the difference between ""fast food"" and ""fast casual "" since I apparently didn\'t get it.  Oh  I get it.  He suggests that they not only prepare my food and ring me up  they deliver it to my table.  Wow.  Well  that deserves an extra special bonus  right?  Meanwhile  I have to select the least dirtiest table in the dining room because nobody\'s out there cleaning them off.  Nobody checks up on me at my table afterwards.  Nobody refills my drink.  Nobody takes my trash away for me.  I left a 20% gratuity on the bill I signed at the register.

As advertised; it\'s hot dogs. Sure  hot dogs with all different toppings  but hot dogs nonetheless.\n\nAs expected  it\'s a totally casual place. You order at teh counter  and then they bring your order to your table. The booth we sat in  however  was totally weird. On the side I was sitting in  it was a normal sized booth  that could fit 2 people  but no more. But the side my husband sat on was about a half of a booth  so that only he would have been able to sit on that side. Weird  and kind of awkward.\n\nI ordered the ""No. 1"" - which is topped with chili relish (which I love whenever I can get it)  mustard  onions  and a pickle spear. It really was a pretty good hot dog. The pickle spear made it a bit difficult to eat (it pushed the dog out of the bun)  but I just kept mashing it back in after each bite. I was not  however  thrilled with the bun; plain  like from a grocery store shelf  cold  and kind of doughy.\n\nMy husband ordered the Cheese Coney  and I had a bite of that  too. That one was also pretty good; topped with chili  cheese and onions. \n\nThe 2 of us split an order of their homemade chips  and there were more than enough to share in that order. This was probably my favorite part of the meal. The chips were hot and crunchy and had a cool dipping sauce to go with it. My husband puzzled (a few times)  about why they didn\'t even have fries available. I didn\'t really care  and I like the chips  but I do agree that a lot of people probably would like some fries with their dog.\n\nI also enjoyed the small bar that had some free extras  like ginger carrots and pickled vegetables. I munched on those while we were waiting for our dogs to arrive. This was a really inexpensive  enjoyable lunch (I think it cost $11 for the both of us)  and a good family place. I\'m a little baffled at some of the excitement that I\'ve read in the other reviews  because  I mean  I just can\'t get that excited about a hot dog  even if it\'s good  but I\'d go back every once in a blue moon for a cheap  quick  yummy  totally unhealthy lunch.\n\nThere\'s not much else to say; other than: hot dogs.', 'I have driven past JJ\'s so many times and always thought to my self  ""meh  hot dogs.""

I got the Sonoran Dog and my friend got the chicken tenders with fries. The fry order was definitely big enough to split! The Sonoraran veggie dog was awesome! Salsa  beans  slaw  and some cream sauce. Honestly  couldnt even tell it was a veggie dog!

I\'ve been coming here since before the grand opening  and have been pleased on every turn.\n\nI appreciate that they tried on their menu at the beginning  saw what worked and what didn\'t  and made a few changes. I didn\'t mind the loss of fries  since the chips are really quite good. I was disappointed at first to find they didn\'t have a vegetarian ""dog"" on the menu  but upon hearing that they weren\'t pleased with any mainstream offerings and hadn\'t created one in-house that they would be stoked to serve  I could handle the wait. When they finally created the ""veJJie "" I tried it and am hooked. It\'s sautéed portobello  onion and peppers on a toasted bun with their KILLER aioli (or whatever they call it). It\'s a delicious combination and I am SO glad they didn\'t settle for a flaky  sub-par  tofu-esque creation.\n\nAs for the meaty offerings  all I hear are good things from the Mr. about the new sausage creations -- namely the Merguez  debuted at Sausagefest (an event I attended purely for the unlimited craft beer sampling). The Char Heel  JJ\'s #1 and Chicago are also big hits according to my sources.\n\nThere are other menu selections I enjoy trying from time to time...the onion rings are a worthy choice  salads are good (i loved the seasonal one with goat cheese from the summer)  beer selection is better than you\'d expect for a quick-casual place  and the orangeade and lemonades are totally refreshing and delicious. A perfect complement to the heavier entree items.\n\nOh  and the other day they had a butternut squash soup that was perfectly executed. Thanks!!\n\nI love the rooftop seating  and their effort to create a fun  casual environment through having live music acts nearly every weekend. Also impressive is the fact that they make everything except the Sahlen\'s dogs IN HOUSE. And everything possible is NC sourced. For a semi-locavore like myself  that is definitely noteworthy. I think JJ\'s has some staying power in the community and look forward to their continued presence.\n\nAll in all  this isn\'t a prime spot for vegetarians  but it\'s a worthy lunch spot or quick dinner locale  especially if you\'re hitched to a hot dog or sausage lover (or have a pile of hungry kids to feed).\n\n**Make sure when ordering that you are EXTRA specific with any alterations to the prescribed dog condiments  etc. Occasionally orders come out just shy of what you order...but that\'s generally supplemented by stellar customer service on the redo.', 'I was pleasantly surprised by JJ Redhots. I went  Groupon in hand  expecting to have a hot dog  only to find myself distracted by the big selection of  dogs and sausages. I was intrigued by the salmon ""sausage"" sliders on the menu  and decided to go with them.  They arrived quickly  served on buns with a tasty mayo sauce. The salmon burgers themselves were nicely seasoned. For a side I chose a salad  which was also very fresh and tasty. My lunch companion had a hot dog and chips for a side  which she said were very good. I would definitely come back! Prices are very reasonable  and there is a wide variety on the menu to suit many tastes.', ""I love JJ's!!! I love the whole concept. I went last night with my husband and a friend  and we each got two different dogs. We were kind of hanging out waiting at the soda machine when one of the guys assured us that he would bring our food  even if we were sitting outside. He did  shortly after. (Confession: I was just standing there so I could keep eating their homemade pickles and picked onions- yum!!). We sat on the rooftop  which was perfect for a nice November evening. After two dogs and a side  we were stuffed. \n\nI love the fact that this place really tries to incorporate other Charlotte businesses  whether it's local beers or King of Pops  etc. The service has been excellent every time I've been- everyone is super chill and patient  and encourages you to try new things! They have special dogs every week and deals every day but Monday. \n\nAwesome place for a quick dinner  especially with kiddos."", ""This review is a bit bias being that I'm from Chicago and once you've been exposed to eating Vienna ALL Beef hotdogs you'll never be impressed by another hotdog again in your life! It's a blessing and a curse. \n\nAlthough their hotdogs were good  I don't think I'll be returning any time soon. The service is very friendly and they're pretty efficient  the hotdog itself is not up to Chicago Hotdog Standards. I would definitely recommend for anyone that likes hotdogs  but for those of you that happen to be from Chicago you might not be impressed. \n\nEnjoy!"", ""I've been wanting to try these folk forever! Finally my husband and I checked them out today. The hotdogs were great and the service was wonderful. We really enjoyed ourselves. Great laid back place with yummy hotdogs as well!"", 'My brother  a prolific Charlotte Yelp Elitist  had been raving about JJ\'s ""Soon To Be Famous"" Onion Rings so I had to come see for myself. Walking in  we found ourselves transported to a classic diner space. You walk up and place your order then have a seat. Thankfully we beat the lunch rush since there wasn\'t a line yet. Also appreciated how clean it was inside.\n\nI ordered a Single Dog Combo with the Chili Cheese Coney Dog and subbed the fries for the onion rings. My brother did the same thing except he ordered the Sonoran (Southwestern Style). The Chili Cheese dog was delicious. The bun held up the dog and fixins. The onion rings were out of this world! Thin rings like onion straws that also reminded me of The Outback Steakhouse\'s Bloomin\' Onion but a way better version. Excellent seasoning in the batter and crispy texture. Some parts could be a little greasy  but it\'s worth it. I\'d come back just to order the rings but the dogs are also great.', ""What can I say about this place?  I came here when it first opened and frequented it often when I lived in Charlotte. I moved away to tampa but my love for JJ'S never died. Anytime a friend is coming to Charlotte I tell them one place they HAVE to check out is JJ'S! The food is amazing  but what really makes this place is their management!  From the owner Jon Luther (very cool cat) to the staff and the marketing director(Brandy) they love their customers!  I'd give ya 10 stars. Now if I can just get ya to move to Tampa   I'd be in heaven! I'd even apply to help run it!  Keep up the great work guys and gals"", ""For a hot dog restaurant  JJ's is pretty decent. In my visit  I ordered the double dog combo with the Sonoran dog  the Dirty Jerz  and onion rings. It was a little over $10 with a drink  which isn't too bad of a deal for a decent amount of food. I was particularly impressed at how quickly my food came out too; I checked out the pickle bar (Dill pickle  sweet pickle  pickled red onions  pickled jalapenos  and pickled carrots)  grabbed a seat and the dogs were on my table in 3-4 total minutes.\nThe dogs were decent quality  and the buns were really nice and soft. Turns out they use Martin's potato rolls  which are probably my favorite buns so that explains the high quality. The Sonoran dog was good but not great. The beans and salsa had just a hint of heat and added good flavor to the dog  but the cilantro cream was basically just ranch  and there was way too much of it for my liking as it overpowered everything else. I scraped off a lot of the cream  added a few pickled jalapenos  and the dog was a lot better. The Dirty Jerz was essentially the same: decent dog but nothing life changing. The sweet pickles balanced the sauerkraut well  and mustard is always perfect on a hot dog. The onion rings were pretty bad in my opinion. They're pretty greasy  thin  and VERY crunchy. I can understand why some people are fans  but I prefer much thicker cut onion rings with good onion flavor  and these were the exact opposite of that.\nOverall  my two dogs were decent but nothing special and the onion rings were just not my cup of tea  but the prices weren't bad  the food came out very quick  and the pickle bar is pretty cool."", 'A funky scene with great dogs and wide selection of craft beers. The onion rings have a nice crispy breading. Will definitely be back.', ""I never been so disappointed by anything that comes in between two buns but damn this place messed up. It simply was horrible Burnt over cooked smelled like gas and char toppings drinched and ill prepared. I just don't know how u could mess up a frank and brawt. Will be considerate give two stars instead of ripping them a new one with one star"", 'I so want to like this place. However  my dining experience last night has made that a bit difficult. My son and I went for dinner because Wednesdays are Kids Eat Free night there. He got the Corn Dog Nuggets & I got the sausage special  The Royal w/ Cheese with no onions  a water and french fries. Our bill was over $10 - that\'s with his being free and neither of us getting a drink. Thought that was pretty pricey for a sausage. I looked after I sat down and the normal sausage combo  which includes drink and fries is $7.99. I thought  ""oh well  maybe this particular sausage doesn\'t count toward that."" \nWhen our food came his was hot and he loved it. I took one bite of my sausage and realized it was super cold. I took it back and the woman said she\'d fix it. I will note that they had suddenly become busy in the time that we ordered and when I took this back. \nI waited a good while before they brought it back out. My son had completely finished when they finally brought my meal back to the table. They did not bring me my fries back and there were onions on it. She said  ""Oh  was that not suppose to have mustard?"" Upon saying that I realized that the first sausage didn\'t have mustard either. I told her don\'t worry about it as my son is young and keeping him occupied at this point while I scarfed down my food would be a challenge in itself and I didn\'t feel like waiting another 15 minutes for another sausage. It was warmer this time  but not what I\'d call fresh off the grill hot either. In fact  I didn\'t even finish it.\nI didn\'t go back up to say anything because they were so busy and frankly I was over it. I left feeling disappointed and still hungry. Pretty bummed about our experience overall and don\'t think we will be returning.', ""I purchased the Andouille Sausage Po'Boy style.  The sausage was housemade and you could tell it was super fresh.  The onion rings were super crisp.  The fries were good too.  The time I'm in Charlotte I'm going back to try another sausage along with the andouille sausage!  You guys did a wonderful job!"", 'So I\'ve been wanting to try this place out for sometime now being that it has such great reviews  and I just love a good hot dog. Was finally in that area  so I thought I would stop by and try it out. The establishment is very clean and the customer service was awesome. I ordered the Char Heel dog  and the Dirty Jerz. The Char Heel dog was ok  nothing to rave about. The relish on the Dirty Jerz was not to my liking nor was the sauerkraut. I actually ended up scraping the toppings off. The actual hot dog had a nice ""char"" but didn\'t taste like a beef hot dog  which is the type of hot dogs they advertise as using. The most enjoyable part of my meal was the fries which were cooked and seasoned nicely. Overall I\'m not sure why their hot dogs get such rave reviews. Maybe Im just picky. With that stated its definitely Not a place I would go to for a good sloppy hot dog.', ""This is my #1 place to visit when I'm in Charlotte. My go to is the vegetarian Sonoran (southwestern style)dog or the vegetarian Joliet Jake (Chicago style) dog.  The house chips with the buttermilk ranch dip is so good  but my husband prefers the tater tots with cheese on top. He usually orders the Dirty Jerz turkey dog or the Kasekreiner sausage dog. We've heard good things about the Smoked Salmon Sliders  but I haven't had the chance to order them yet. I love that this place has its own parking lot and that is a big plus compared to many places in the neighborhood."", ""LOVE THIS PLACE! can't go wrong with their hot dogs and I love the weekly hot dog specials.  The southern girl dog is probably my favorite and you can't go wrong with a side of tots.  Follow their instagram for their weekly specials (warning: it will make you hungry).  \nThey also have a great selection of beers  with good deals  and a rotating draught list! \n\nAnd don't forget to try their homemade pickles! I love the spicy ones."", ""So yum. I love the dogs and chips. This isn't a fancy-schmancy place. It's a hot dog joint  so expect that. \n\nI always order the chili cheese dog and side of chips. I LOVE the Ogre sauce. I would dip myself in it and everything I own if that wasn't weird. \n\nMy fiancé is a little more adventurous with his dogs and always tries the special. He's always happy  but maybe because he's using that Ogre sauce  too. \n\nAnyway  give this joint a try. The rooftop seating is fun on a nice day."", ""I can totally see why they have a cult following! The ambiance is casual and they have a great rooftop deck to enjoy a beer and a hot dog. \n\nI love that they offer veggie dogs - and they're tasty!! You can completely customize your dog or get a weekly featured dog or their signature options. I like that the menu has Vegetarian options clearly marked. \n\nThe fresh orangeade is killer and I highly recommend it. They also have can and draft beer and sodas/tea. They even have glass bottle cheerwine!\n\nThey have a complimentary pickle bar! I loved the pickled ginger carrots. \n\nI got the cheesy borracho beans as a side and on my dog- absolutely delicious. I was excited they had tater tots but I wish they had been more crispy- maybe I'll request that next time."", ""I've wanted to try JJ's for a while so my expectations were probably a little too high. It's so hard to find really good hot dogs and I thought this was finally the hot dog haven I've been looking for. They were ok  but I was a little underwhelmed. \n\nFirst  the hot dogs were barely warm  and the onion rings were just about room temp. To me fried food is nearly disgusting when it isn't piping hot. But on to the flavors. I really enjoyed the Char Heel  the hot dog had a nice crunch  and the chili was flavorful and savory. Not at all the cheap hot dog chili found in a 79 cent can. The Chicago dog was a little less enticing. I'm all for complex flavors  but with so many toppings they overpowered the hot dog. I felt like I was eating a meat flavored pickle and pepper in a hot dog bun instead of a hot dog with toppings. Finally  the onion rings were sweet and had just enough batter on them  but I've definitely had better.\n\nThe prices are good; two hot dogs full of toppings with a side and a drink for $9. The interior is very clean and warm  a mashup of old school diner with a slight hipster vibe. \n\nI'd like to assume they were just having an off day  and the next time I visit they'll have the best hot dogs in Charlotte. For that hope  I'd come back."", ""I really enjoy this place  the dogs are good and tots are tasty. Everybody likes a good tasty dog and tots and to wash it down they have a great beer selection. They will sometimes have a special dog that's not on the menu - when I went this past time it was a dog with bacon  queso  French fries  and gravy. I mean my top 5 favorite foods all together what a true dog craftsman who came u with this."", 'I have been wanting to go to this place for a while. Unfortunately  the  establishment and food was just ""meh"". My first issue was the restaurant itself. My party and I walked in and observed unswept floors and a smell that reeked of dirty dishwater. The kicker was that the restaurant was virtually empty! Why?! Definitely not what I expected for a Saturday evening. An employee eventually came to sweep up the food particles and trash  but the odor was still present. I thought a food establishment was suppose to smell like ..ummm  I don\'t know...FOOD!...*sigh*.... I should have hit an ""about-face"" due to those things alone. However  my hot dog hungry teenage son convince my partner and I on giving this place a try. We halfway mozied our bodies to the front counter and was greeted by a rather friendly cashier. I settled on the Seasonal Sausage with an order of fries and their TRU ADE ""Orangeade"".... well  I really didn\'t have much of a choice because their fountain drink machine was out. My only other options were bottled sodas  Lemonade  or beer....*ugh*... While waiting on our food  I took a swig of the famous ""Orangeade""...I looked back at my cup. Not in astonishment  but feeling hella ripped off! * insert my WTF face here*...That ish tasted like water-down Kool-Aide minus the sugar! The only thing that made it ""orange"" was the color and the bits of pulp flying around in it! Oranges sacrifice themselves for this?! So disrespectful....Anywoo  our food came out within 5 minutes and once again the presentation was just ""meh"". I was expecting ""Hot Dawg Heaven"". But  my meal was stuck in hot dog purgatory....a dawg that was waiting to redeem itself... The chicken sausage was very pale. I know  I know...it\'s chicken...but  I was at least expecting some grill marks or a little char on the skin...*super sigh*...the caramelized onions on it was good  though...and the rosemary mustard let me know that it was trying to impress me...moving on to the fries...they were ""room temperature"" warm and a little too hard for my taste...my son polished my fries off  along with his fries and two hot dogs! However  a 15 year boy doesn\'t require much  especially when he\'s not spending his money...Overall \xa0 I would recommend this establishment ONLY if you are in the area and hankering for a hot dog or you\'re a 15 year old spending your parent\'s money.', 'Had the ""dog walks into a bar"" dog. The beer cheese and pretzel roll compliments the great dog perfectly. Onion rings are great.', ""I love their homemade pickled options! I got the Veggie Sonoran and the Veggie Joliet Jake. They used the same veggie dogs I get in my grocery store  so that wasn't a surprise. The toppings were amazing! The atmosphere is great! I loved the dogs too. The homemade chips were good and their homemade ranch was ok. Overall it's an awesome restaurant."", ""Wow  so disappointed. I'm from NC and these are not good hot dogs for the money. My hot dog was burnt and the chili had no flavor. The only thing saving it from getting a 1 star is the lemonade and cole slaw. The onion rings are so spicy that I can't taste the sweetness of the onion. Very sad. Could have been an off night but not sure I will try again."", ""Saw a picture of the dog of the week on Twitter. It was enough to make me leave my house and drive to JJ's immediately. Seriously  I didn't even take the time to change out of my pajamas.\n\nThis week's dog: Pork and Greens. Sauteed collard greens  bacon  red onion and pumpkin mustard. Collard greens just make everything better. Go get this. Delicious.\n\nMy other dog: The Char Heel. Chili  slaw  onions  mustard. You can never go wrong with this Carolina classic.\n\nThe two dog deal comes with a side (I went with the beans. They were good  but I wish I had went with onion rings. Rookie mistake) and a drink for less than ten bucks.\n\nWorkers were friendly. Didn't take long at all to get my food. I believe it took longer to try to bust a left turn out of the parking lot.

Now the Whistle Pig that I got was awesome. Very good and I'll get that again. I also would like to try some of their sausages  chili and onion rings. \n\nWe'll definitely be back. \n\nRight before our orders came out a manager asked if they could give it to us to go. I inquired as to when they closed and as stated Yelp had the hours as closing at 9pm. The manager said those were not correct and he will change it. \n\nWe were fine with eating the dogs outside.

I decided to give this place a shot anyway.  Not that I had much of choice  because that's where the majority of my coworkers wanted to go for lunch that week.\n\nAs you can probably tell  I was pleasantly surprised!  I got the Quarter Hounder -- really flavorful  just a little messy to eat.  Their fries were delicious  and were even better with a scoop of chili on top.

SHOULD REALLY CHECK OUT THIS JOINT! or you be missing out"", ""I got to try out JJ's for my first time on a beautiful Saturday afternoon just right after the lunch rush (around 2:00ish). The parking lot is small but my friend and I were able to snag two spots that opened right as we pulled into the lot  likely due to the timing of our visit. \n\nJJ's has two floors  upper patio and lower inside seating. The menu is chocked full of regional hot dog combos as well as options for personalizing your own. I ended up choosing the Whispering Pig (bacon makes everything better) with a side of onion rings and one of the local brews for my drink.\n\nMy friend chose the brew dog of the week  You Got Smoked  with a side of fries and the smoked amber beer.  By the time my friend ordered  JJ's ended up running out of the smoked amber beer so they gave her another drink on the house!\n\nWe grabbed our number and found a seat. This is where JJ's hit a snag. One of the employees dropped off my drink and then took our table number. Since this was our first time at JJ's  we weren't sure of how things were run. During the time that we proceeded to wait for our food to arrive  we learned that the employees are supposed to take the table number ONLY after delivering your food.\n\nAfter watching a table whom we knew arrived after us did we stop the same employee who took our number and ask her what happened to our food. She then admitted her error and our food magically appeared. Unfortunately  it was no longer hot because it must have been sitting waiting for its rightful owners. The 'famous' JJ's onion rings I ordered ended up being cold. Cold onion rings are just a no-no. My friend's fries weren't that much warmer. We didn't want to send the food back because we were hungry. Thankfully  the hot dogs were still pretty warm and ended up being very delicious.\n\nEven though the error put a little bit of damper on our meal  I definitely plan on going back because the hot dogs were VERY good and there are other combos I want to try as well as get to have a different experience."", ""Good for a quick lunch. It took me a while to figure out what I wanted to order with so many good options; walk up to order restaurants are not my favorite to be a first timer. I went with the chicken sandwich with pickle and coleslaw  onion rings and an orangeade; came to $9 with change. The sandwich was on a hot dog bun - two chicken fingers  1/4 pickle and a heaping amount of coleslaw. A mess to eat but still good. The onion rings were thin and crisp. A friend of mine got the nachos which I ate most of. Whoops. I will order them next time because the chips were thick and a perfect mix of crisp and chewy. Sometimes you just want nacho cheese  can't be eating clean all the time. I have to mention the orangeade was fantastic! It tasted like a better version of Snapple orangeade from my 90s childhood. I would go back for this drink alone!"", 'Great place  great atmosphere  friendly staff.  My favorite is the sexy rexy.  So many possibilities with hotdogs.  Kids eat free on Wednesdays.', ""First time coming here. The JJ's Original with grilled onions and peppers was delicious!"", 'With a menu featuring eight unique chargrilled smokehouse hot dogs from Sahlen\'s Packing Company in Buffalo  New York it quickly became a daunting task trying to decide what we were going to try first. I figured if the first thing on the menu is named after the restaurant itself.. I\'d be doing the world a disservice by not checking it out. So we ordered a JJ\'s ""No.1″ Red Hot Hot Dog  the Chicken and Herb Sausage  Andouille Sausage Sliders  and Onion Rings.\n\nThe Chicken and Herb Sausage was very well received at our table and ended up being a favorite of the night. The sausage was cooked to perfection and the toppings were piled high. As for the JJ\'s ""No.1″ Red Hot Hot Dog.. it was good. I guess I didn\'t realize that the Webers Mustard they use is a horseradish type mustard and not anywhere like the typical French\'s yellow mustard I\'m use too. The first bite sent my nose into hyper drive and my brain scrambling to figure out what had just happened. I cant fault the hot dog for the mustard... there\'s plenty of people that love horseradish  I\'m just not one of them. Without the mustard the hot dog was amazing. The smokehouse hot dogs from Sahlen\'s were chargrilled  juicy  plump  and full of flavor.\n\nThe Andouille Sausage Sliders were also on our favorites list for the night. It came out piled high with andouille sausage  creamy cole slaw  on toasted Martins bun and except for being a little on the messy side was perfect. The onion rings had a mixed reaction at our table. We couldn\'t decide if the batter needed a new recipe... or if they just needed some ranch to dip them in. The texture was right on point but we couldn\'t shake an awkward taste after every bite.\n\nJJ\'s Red Hots also has hand spun milk shakes in four different flavors. We tried the mocha (which was delicious)  the vanilla (which was a little on the boring side)  and the strawberry (which needed just a little more strawberry). For the most part they were all delicious and well worth checking out.. .especially if the whether stays above 100 degree\'s like it is right now.\n\nCharlotte is in desperate need of more restaurants serving up incredible food  at a great price  for the average person and JJ\'s Red Hots hits that mark.

I just had the Char Heel and the Whistle Pig and I do not care what is in hot dogs!  If hot dog haters would get their nose out of the sky and try this place they wouldn't care less either.  The dogs are nice and juicy and and the toppings will make sure to shower up afterwards.  When you get the dog  don't put anything else on it other than jalepenos.  I feel that they come the way it is intended to be eaten.  We have always had good experiences here and their rooftop seating is especially nice during this time of the year."", ""This is definitely worth going to at least once. It's got a fun  casual atmosphere with so many fun choices. Obviously  this is not really a place for eating light (although they do have some lighter options). The pig whistler is a good choice for those who want something a little more familiar. The kasekeiner totally lives up to the hype  but is a little spicier than I anticipated. Their signature orangeade is super  super sweet-- it was actually too much for me to drink  but had a good flavor. We will definitely be back to explore the menu more."", ""I have been on a hunting for the best hot dog in Charlotte and since I never paid a visit to this place my husband and I decided that was time to go.\nThey have plenty of options  you can pick from their menu or create your own hotdog. I rather creat my own since none of their options grabbed my attention. I went with chili with queso hot dog and queso tater tots. My husband had a combo with a cheese and bacon hotdog and a slaw hot dog with regular tots.\nThe place was not that busy so the food came out fast. The tater tots were the best that I've ever had in my life!!! My hotdog was good but was not heavenly good so I had to take one star from them since they are supposed to have the best hot dogs around. \nWe will definitely be back  mainly for the tater tots  and I hope next time they surprise me with some wonderful hotdog!"", ""Finally got around to visit JJ's over the weekend and had the Chili Cheese Coney with onion rings.

I ordered take out...I ordered the char hill hotdog  well ok I ordered 2 char hill dogs . I got chilli on the side because I'm really picky when it comes to chilli  but the chilli was just ok nothing special but it was good on the dog.

The parking lot is really tight as well."", ""They put bacon on a hot dog. \n\nThat fact alone was enough to make my dinner special.

I can\'t say that I\'ve made it to a restaurant that offers so many aesthetic considerations  a diverse menu of all-things-on-a-bun  and continues to show up with originality. \n\nThere are many things I love about this joint. Here\'s a few:\n\nNovelty. The presentation of something simple like a hot dog can\'t get overly complicated and sometimes you really want a restaurant to just stick to their guns. JJ\'s takes a small step in an adventurous direction with hotdogs  sausages  and other wiener-esque concoctions  but not in a distasteful way. Love the true  blue homage to the Chicago-style dog  NC chili dog  and the coney. All are always solid choices. \n\nPickle bar. I\'m a huge fan of anything pickled (maybe not pig\'s feet or eggs) and love that they house a menagerie of veggies. I highly recommend the ""quick pickles."" Very subtle with just a hint of clove. Marvelous. \n\nMartin\'s Rolls. Sure. These guys could slave away and bake fresh rolls every single day  but Martin\'s makes a mean roll. The perfect vehicle for a smokey dog. \n\nSahlens. Hands down one of the best tasting dogs I\'ve had. Chalked up there next to Hebrew National and a few other homemade varietals. \n\nMilkshakes. Goodness gracious. I don\'t even need to explain this. Just try one. \n\nOrangeade. Fresh squeezed oranges and some soda water  a little fresh basil/mint. Based on a old 40\'s style beverage. Huge in the Carolinas. Definitely worth a shot if you\'re feeling it. \n\nA few places for improvement will always arise with a newbie in town. Here\'s a few:\n\nSides. I\'ve heard many grumblings of ""Why aren\'t there fries?"" I\'m not a huge fan of fries with a dog  but could be a well-considered venture. \n\nStaff. Sometimes the staff at the registers can a be a little nonchalant with customers. I think a little explanation of menu items  specials  or recommendations could go a long way. \n\nI\'m stoked that JJ\'s has made it\'s way onto East blvd. Can\'t wait to see that walk-up window open on the outside! Looks so rad!', ""As a hot dog aficionado  I'm always looking for the next great weenie. JJ's is the real deal.  I'm not in Charlotte very often but when I return I'm definitely heading back to this place.  The charred weenie on my Char-Heel was a pleasant sight and the fact that the weenie sticks out both ends of the bun is a special thing. The toppings were not only fresh and flavorful but were also the maximum amount you can put on a hot dog before it becomes a hot mess. My lunch would have scored a 10 at the hot dog Olympics. \n\nOrdering is at the counter where you take a  number for later delivery by a server. The toppings are already enough but there's also a pickle bar if you're so inclined.  All the accessories are easy to find and are offered in spotless efficiency.  \n\nThe dining room is large and offers variety and comfort but If weather permits take the time to dine on the outdoor roof-top patio. \n\nGreat classic rock art adorns the walls here and there (bathroom) and the Guy Fieri  sheet pan is pretty cool too."", ""JJ's is by far my favorite and most-frequented fast casual restaurant in Charlotte. Their fancy hotdogs are amazing - grilled hotdogs with all the best toppings. My favorite is the Southern Girl - pimento cheese  chili  bacon crumbles  and mustard atop an all beef frank. They also have great sides and even have vegan options and salads. \n\nThey offer a free pickle bar  have coloring sheets and crayons for kids  offer a rooftop deck with picnic tables (so you can bring your dog)  have ample parking  and have super reasonable prices (a fancy dog  side  and drink combo is under $10.00). Join their loyalty program and expect discounted dogs  free drinks  and premium access to specials! \n\nThey were recently featured on Diners  Drive-Ins  and Dives and the famous Guy Fieri paid them a visit.

We had a variety of hot dogs and various sides.  The sides tried were chips  pinto beans and onion rings.  Everything was good.  The time between ordering and the food being delivered was short."", ""My last stop in Charlotte before I flew back home. I was there around 1:30 on 6/1 with some coworkers.

Good food  with fair prices."", ""It was opening day and my wife wanted to go.  There was a long line so I didn't expect to be served right away.  The music was way too loud considering the conditions.  My wife and I had the JJs White Hots and my children had hot dogs. We had the onion rings and french fries.  The White Hots were a little small considering the price but were tasty.  My children were not very enthusiastic in their comments regarding the hot dogs.  The onion rings were good but the french fries had nothing special about them.  They were very plain.  The soft drink selection was not very expansive.  A lot of the new self-serve places are using the touch-screen machines that give you a wide variety of drinks.  It is a little expensive for hot dogs and bratwursts.  The White Hot upgrade to a combo that includes the fries or onion rings and a drink is about $10.00.  Check the menu before you go because it is limited.  I expected more than was offered there and all of us left the restaurant agreeing that we won't hurry back any time soon.  For that reason  I could not give it 4 stars."", ""Best hot dogs in Charlotte by far.  Triple D don't lie!"", 'I told myself I would never go to JJ\'s because I don\'t believe in eating overpriced hot dogs but when it was national hot dog day I decided to give it a try since it was only $2. That being said...I still wouldn\'t spend $2 on their hot dogs! My dog was completely burnt and the bun was way too small for it. I\'m still very confused why it was completely black. Literally tasted like charcoal. Is that what charbroil is? Also  the wait was extremely long and nobody else was in front of us. The staff was trying to clean the whole restaurant at 8:30 so they could get out by 9:00  but if you stay open till 9:00 you should wait until your customers leave before closing. When we walked in at 8:30 they already had the chairs up and were pretty much pushing customers out the door with their ""I just want to get out of here"" attitudes. However  I think what upsets me most and probably what makes me the most bitter is that this East Boulevard location is PRIME and such a waste going to an overpriced hot dog place. They have an awesome roof top patio that I could have sat at for hours but then I remembered I was at a hot dog restaurant and that they were closing at 9...what a waste of a good location. Hope they go out of business so we can get a cool roof top bar on the block that stays open late.', ""Great location  hot dogs are impeccable  house chips are the bomb.com  and don't even get me started on the pickle bar! JJ's is my go to lunch spot. They create such unique flavor combos and always get me to step outside of my box when need be (peanut butter on a dog  mango salsa  etc). I think everyone should try JJ's at least once. You won't be disappointed"", ""Memorial Day without my hot dog!  No way! \nSearched yelp for a great hot dog place close by and decided to drive 13 mins here once leaving work.  Got a free tots offer at check-in.  I wanted something traditional and one to be daring.  I decided to try both the Sonoran and the cashier recommended the Brisket hot dog.  I love BBQ anyway.  I didn't have to wait in line or wait for my order long as it was made on the spot.  Young patrons 20 and 30 something's were all dining in on a Monday night.  Pricing is sort of fair for a non-traditional hot dog joint.  I want to go Hawaiian and come back for the pineapple dogs."", ""This is my second shot at a JJ's  having had the Ballantyne experience where the owner came back disappointed in my review and that I didn't get it  the experience that is.\n\nSo...son and I went to Dilworth for lunch.  This time I ordered the bratwurst and the Italian  like before and ordered a naked dog so I could really taste the basic product.  Also  onion rings.\n\nOnion rings were good and portion plentiful.  And compared to previous JJ's experience were oily  but not saturated  were not a clump of rings stuck together  but were loose enough to eat separately.  Flavor was excellent and they were hot  not just warm.  Apparently Dilworth cooks to order without them sitting around.\n\nMy quality and taste standard is the Nathan's Beef Frank.  It is flavorful  savory  has a snap to the casing  and is a great dog.  Now I get it  that we all have different tastes.  My loves are your hates and vice verse.  JJ's is a good dog.  It came lightly charred  which is far better than one taken from water or microwave  was flavorful  but not savory and was fatter and longer than the Nathan's.  It WAS a good dog.  If I were rating Nathan's as an A  JJ's would be a solid B or B+.  Respectable.\n\nFor some reason the brat seemed different from the one in Ballantyne.  But it was A-OK  like this review.  Maybe my taste buds were off.  And the Italian was not only good  but dressed with the peppers & onions it also came with a really good mustard.  Excellent.\n\nAs to the service  the cashier  here spoke  answered questions and had  well  personality.  I will make another trip to Ballantyne to look at their menu board because in Dilworth the menus had lots of description.  In fact  there were four people standing inline and I asked if they were ordering and they said that they were reading the menu so we joined them.  Once at the cashier we had our questions set and completed our orders quickly.\n\nSo as a guy who eats about 4 hot dogs annually  JJ's is A-OK.  Am amazed at the 5-star ratings and rave reviews  but accept that hot dogs are not a big deal in my life  eating such confined to airports that have Nathan's and the occasional dog with grandchildren.  \n\nIf you do want hot dogs  JJ's is THE place to go.  If you don't want the doctored dogs  just order a naked and put your standard condiments provided.\n\nI most likely will up my rating for the Ballantyne location after I re-visit.  JJ's is a great place for kids who like dogs and both locations carry out what they do pretty well.\n\nDid I get it?"", ""We have never been here before and as we walked in  there was a menu board with so many hotdogs and sausages it was difficult to pick. \n\nWe had to ask the guy working the register on which was the best. His first pick was the The Char Heel and his second pick was the Chilli Cheese Coney.\n\nWe grabbed our fountain drinks and sat down and within a few minutes  our dogs had arrived.  The first bite of the chilli cheese coney was quite good!  I then went on and tried the Char Heel and it too was very good. \n\nI must say we were impressed with JJ's Red Hots. Next trip into Charlotte and we will come back."", 'Overpriced if you want a plain dog. I ordered a hot dog  fries  and a lemonade and my cost came up to over $8. Took off the fries bc I really just wanted a hot dog and I still paid over $7. A bit much for a hot dog  I think. The dog was alright- something I should have made in my own oven.

I tried the Maui and Dirty Jerz. I\'d probably say the Maui was the better of the two but they were both high end wieners. They really pile on the condiments at this place and they also have a mini condiment stand where you can add extra jalapenos and vinegar soaked veggies and such. The hot dogs themselves are kind of a ""mild"" red hot so they don\'t completely destroy your insides. The setup in here for ordering is kind of like a stand in that you don\'t have a server. You just order  they give you a number and run the food to you when it\'s ready. They do have a pretty decent beer selection as well even though it is limited. The whole meal cost me around 13$ for two hot dogs and a beer so I\'d say it\'s a little on the pricey side for a lunch. All of the staff was very friendly. Oh yeah  we tried the house chips which were the ""potato chip"" style and they were good but nothing to really write home about.', 'Best hot dogs and Italian sausage in Charlotte. Try everything on the menu and add the onion things or house chips!', ""JJ's is a Charlotte gem and I was thrilled to find it yesterday!  They've got a great hot dog menu including a Chicago dog that's done correctly. Beyond dogs  they've got great drinks (house made orangeade!)  other foods (chicken  smoked salmon  etc.)  and they're very kid friendly. My son loved the giant crayon bucket and they even taped his drawing to the wall :)\nPlus  kids eat free on Wed  so  next time I'll be visiting on a Wed. I was totally impressed with the house made pickles (hot and sweet)  pickled jalo's and onions  and ginger carrots.

I would recommend it to anyone looking for a tasty  creative casual meal at a very fair price."", ""A fun & fresh show for their opening!  The drum corp was an original idea!  The staff were really nice and helpful.  I like that there is a separate take - out entrance.\n\nOf course with so much going on our expectations were high.  I had to go with the Char Heel which was delicious with just enough crisp on it.  The potato buns are a nice touch  but I wish they were grilled  too!  The chili was a great blend.  The coleslaw was a good Southern flavor  but not enough onions.  Good  delicious  savory yellow mustard.  A definite hit.\n\nThe JJ's White Hot was - ummm - not a favorite.  My brat was smallish & overcooked & my sweetie's was way larger & undercooked.  We left half of both of them.\n\nWe were confused by what was Dusted on the Shoestring Fries?   We even asked & they said the salt is the dust...???whaaaa???  Just call them Shoestring Fries & we can assume they're salted.  I guess I was just looking for garlic powder or some other seasoning.  (it was also a small portion & they must have sat for awhile before we got them)\n\nOverall it's a nice addition to the area - although now I'm on a mission to try all the hot dogs in the area to make a true comparison!"", ""Just smashed a double-dog combo from JJs and boy is my afternoon better.\n\nIf you're on the fence between a single dog combo and a double dog  ALWAYS  always  always  ALWAYS go for the double.\n\nYou can try out two different dogs and really get the FULL experience.\n\nBeing from Chicago  I always get the Joliet Jake.

Hot dogs are great so many different toppings and options! Fast and good service', 'The first exposure I had to JJ\'s Red Hots was at an event where they were providing samples. My own internal monologue went a little something like this ""Hot dogs ... seriously?"" Oh  how wrong I was completely wrong! \n\nThe gentleman behind the counter slinging these tasty delights at me just so happened to be the composer / creator on the main features in these entrees. He had magically worked his own little twist in to the Andouille and Bratwurst  and I was digging it. In the back of my mind I thought that this may be a fluke. I bet this guy brought the best of the best just to lure in new clientele. There\'s no way it\'s like this all the time. So  I decided to swing by the establishment and see if this joint is the real deal. The first words out of my mouth as I walked through the door was a little like Keanu Reeves  ""Woah!"" The place was ridiculously clean  and I\'m a neat freak. Even the restrooms were on point. That alone will keep me coming back  but they were able to mix a 50s malt shop decor with a modern chic twist which is very comfortable and welcoming. On top of that  the gumbo was amazing and the Andouille was just as delightful as before. During the dining endeavor  I was introduced to their pickle bar. If you\'re a fan of spicy foods like I am  you have to try their pickled jalapeños. They have a great flavor and pretty big kick  but not in an overpowering way. I hope at some point they jar these so I can take them home with me to add to my own dishes.\n\nI will definitely be adding this establishment to my short list of fantastic restaurants to bring guests when they come to visit here in Charlotte. \n\nI can\'t wait for the summer time to be upon us.

I tried to order the Whistle Pig  but they were out of a key ingredient  so no luck this time.  \n\nDogs themselves:  Both were very good  but not necessarily great  because  after all  we're writing about hot dogs.  The toppings make or break these things  in my opinion.  The Maui Gold with sweet and tangy pineapple salsa paired with the crisp diced onion and hot dog provided some unique flavors I haven't tasted before.  Buns were fresh.  Two thumbs up. \n\nService:  A little bit chaotic  but  this is  after all  their second day in operation  so I'll give them a pass.  There were plenty of staff members around  so it's not like mgmt has tried to cut corners.  They just need to settle into role and responsibilities a little and develop a better understanding of how to interact with customers (I felt like cashier was reading a script and the person handing me my food at the end of the counter was in another world).  I'd also point out the restaurant doesn't seem to flow very well.  Food is being carried by staff members to tables through the crowd of people waiting for to-go orders  which happens to be the same spot as the soft drink machine crowd.  I wish they could have spaced things out a little better.\n\nPrice:  Very reasonable.  $3.50 for a dog; add $2.50 if you want onion rings and a drink.  That's cheap by East Blvd standards.\n\nOverall  I think any place with a line extending to the door has something good going on.  I'll be back  hopefully they will have worked out the service kinks by that time.  Dilworth workers just gained another great spot to grab a quick  but decent lunch.

They have bottles on the wall (rotating) as well as a good local draft selection.

My most recent visit was to get out  enjoy the sunshine  and eat something other than soup after a bout with the flu. My wife and I ended up getting one of the No. 1 Red Hot  Sonoran  and the special dog of the day which featured candied bacon and pesto. All around  everything was great with the Sonoran taking the crown. I appreciate that they have multiple style dogs that you can mix and match with the menu. I recommend trying the veggie dog as it has become my go to. Pro tip: you can get a free fry when you check in with yelp. This place also serves local beers on tap and don't pass the sauce counter with home-made pickles and ginger soaked carrots. \n\nMy favorite part of this place is the outdoor seating  namely on the roof. Great place to sit and relax with a beer while you watch the commotion on East Blvd wiz by. Also during the summer they have a fair amount of live music.

Neither will disappoint! As for sides  you can get fries  tots  onion rings  a side salad  etc. and no matter what you get  they are quite generous on their side portion!

I just wish it were closer. Of course  then I would be spending way too much time there  so it's probably for the best that it's just where it is.\n\nYou can find a most excellent selection of dogs on the menu  but even after all these visits  my favorite is still the Char-Heel. Nothing quite like a charred dog. Though you can of course eat a boiled dog - and you can probably eat one without even boiling it  truth be known - there isn't one quite like a dog without a good char on it. And while most of JJ's dogs have a good char  the combination of ingredients on the Char-Heel just seem to come out the best.\n\nThere are a decent selection of toppings on the others  but they don't hit the spot quite the same. While I like the sides  they almost always end up a little limp for my taste. A good example is that batch of onion rings (straws?). The first one or two is great. But after a few minutes  it turns into a sloppy mess  and it's really hard to get to the bottom  but throw just a couple on top of the Char-Heel and you're set.\n\nAnother great thing about JJ's is that pickle bar. And also don't forget to use your Yelp app - you can typically get something for free (sometimes more than one thing)  just for firing it up."", ""I've suddenly developed an irrational fondness for hot dogs  and JJ's Red Hots has become my Sistene Chapel for hot dogs.

Now I love this restaurant even more for having a vegetarian option!!!"", ""First visit yesterday and I have to admit I love it.

With this building's bad reputation for keeping tenants  I hope JJ's can make it for the long haul. I'm a big fan."", 'How do you go to JJ\'s Red Hots without getting a hot dog?! That\'s me. I did that. I got the Smoked Salmon Sliders and they were ""okay."" I was not mind-blown like I was looking forward to being  but they were good sliders. They also had good customer service. Next time (because I will be coming back) I will get a hot dog and update my review.', ""I went here after my son's kindergarten graduation. They were having a deal for a free kids meal if you showed a good report card or graduation. I've been wanting to try this place for a while so I figured it was the perfect time! There wasn't much parking but it wasn't crowded so that was a plus. The staff was amazing. Very friendly and attentive. I ended up getting a chili cheese dog and my son got the little mini hot dogs. He didn't get the concept but I was told children usually love them lol. They even had crayons and a coloring page for him while we waited. They were attentive from beginning to end and I definitely plan to return!"", ""I wanted to love it because of DDD. I wanted to love it because it looks fun. I wanted a hot dog with snap... womp womp. \n\nI ordered the DDD combo (of course) because it is the touristy thing to do  but also because I enjoy being gluttonous. The cashier rang me up a different way because the daily special made it cheaper than the combo. My friend  who ordered the same thing didn't get so lucky - he paid the combo price which was about $1.50 more. The flavors were great but the texture of both dogs were not appealing. This was my first visit but my buddy had been to the other location before and agreed that they were soft and just mushy. He said he never had a bad experience at the other location. (Not sure where it was - I think south of where we were eating). The onion rings were also greasy and not crisp at all so there really wasn't much positive to take away from my visit. I might try again the next time I'm in Charlotte - I believe in second chances/bad days - but if they don't impress then  I won't be back."", ""Tried JJ's the day after the Grand Opening. Smooth ordering process and solid list of options for dogs. Great interior decor and vibe and best of all--the food was very good.  JJ's has been added into our go-to rotation."", 'Wow...  these hot dogs are really good.   I had the The Joliet Jake (Chicago Style) dog and a Chili Cheese Coney dog along with onion rings.

We loved the onion rings as well.\n\nDefinitely will be returning for more!', 'First timer and I enjoyed the fresh-cut fries with vinegar more than the  dog. Lol. The dog was pretty  good  but will  be tastier if I ask for it to be charred more. Good ingredients. Very warm if you dine-in with the open kitchen and 90° weather.  Beware lactose sensitive/vegan  the borracho beans come topped  with cheese. Was unaware  and the menu fails to list;however good after scrapping off  Will be back to try some of the other dogs.', ""Ok  I had to post after my experience last night. \n\nFirst  everything was very clean inside  and I love that they have a rooftop. We were greeted by a friendly face  and I ordered the special Royale with Cheese : andouille sausage infused with blue cheese and topped with caramelized onions  pimiento cheese and blue cheese and whole grain mustard. It was amazing! And the side salad had plenty of toppings. I got my money's worth. \n\nI love that they have King of Pops on hand and the stand is often outside. We were able to enjoy the perfect treat after our dinner."", ""Love the place .... the dogs are small-ish but they are tasty and I love the atmosphere..... would've given them a 5 but I did the tour for the free shirt and they haven't gotten in the 2xl yet....

Can't wait to try the chili dog."", 'If you\'re in the mood for any type of link-type meat (hot dogs or sausage)  JJ\'s can meet your needs.  They offer a both with a variety of toppings.  Unfortunately  the hot dogs are just that: regular hot dogs.  There\'s nothing really exceptional about them for the price.  They\'re not huge or plump.  They\'re the typical small  skinny ones.  Coming from NY state  I\'m used to Zwiegle\'s big meaty wieners; anything less just won\'t do.  You can dress them up all you want  but if you\'re tasting more topping than hot dog  I feel a little cheated.  \n\nJJ\'s is known for their onion rings  with good reason.  They\'re a bit greasy  but very tasty.\n\nMy biggest beef with JJ\'s (see what I did there?)  is with regard to one of their ""business"" practices  and that\'s tipping.  JJ\'s is a fast food joint.  Plain and simple.  There aren\'t servers taking your order at your table  refilling your drinks  checking on you  etc.  To put a line for gratuity when you use your credit card is pretty tacky.  Worse  there\'s a huge bucket by the register that ""suggests"" that if you enjoyed the ""service"" you received from your cashier  drop a couple of dollars in.  Seriously?  The dude says hi  punches a few buttons on a machine  takes my money  and then says ""Next!"" and I\'m supposed to reward him beyond the minimum or above minimum wage he\'s making?  I\'m supposed to pay him more for the job he was hired to do?  \n\nSadly  for this reason alone  like other fast food restaurants that want to believe they\'re full-service  I most likely won\'t return to JJ\'s.  I\'ve worked in fast food service and full service restaurants before and know the difference between the two.', 'I love these hot dogs. This place has a great vibe and feels like a real neighborhood spot.

Can't wait to try all the rest  yummmm!"", ""I went to the East Blvd location and the hotdog was very hard and burned and the onion rings were limp and swimming in grease in the basket. These people don't know how to cook and I will NEVER return.  The staff was not at all friendly."", 'An amazing place! The hot dogs are out of this world  the design/decor is great and the service is fast. Pickle bar is fabulous but needs a dill option. \n\nGive it a try. Wish there was one in Atlanta.

Grilled hot dog topped with pineapple salsa. The salsa was good. A nice crunch to it from the pineapple. However because of the sauce of the salsa. It made my bun very soggy. It fall apart when I took my first bite. But I still like it tho. And the 2nd thing I'm totally in love with is their string onion rings. It's not big  and have a nice crunch to it. You can tell by how much I like crunchy foods. Customer service was great. They check on us twice. First by one of the staff then by the manager. I will definitely come here again. Except put the salsa on the side since I really do HATE soggy buns."", ""I have nothing but good things to say about this place. I've been several times and it's always a great experience.

They have the basics mastered! Whether you're looking for a basic dog  Chicago dog  Carolina dog  a Coney  or southwestern dog you'll find it here. \n\nWhat sets JJ's apart is they're not afraid to venture into uncharted hot dog territory. How about a Rueben dog covered in sauerkraut  Russian dressing  and a pickle spear. How about a pizza dog with marinara sauce  mozzarella cheese  pepperoni  and fresh basil. They also have great local beer selections on tap. It's laid back  fun  and exciting - everything a hot dog place should be."", 'Best hotdog(s) I\'ve ever had. The toppings are phenomenal. The space and design details are great and the concept (once the crowds die down a little and some opening kinks are worked out) is perfect for a very fast  very cheap meal. They have 4 taps of local beers  and then a very decent canned beer list (Oskar Blues and the like). \n\nMy only complaint concerns the VERY young (most looked 18 or under)  VERY inexperienced front of the house staff. It matters little since its a take-a-number type of place  but the girl taking our order was dumb as a box of rocks and had zero social tact.\n\nMe: ""...and a side of fries please.""\nHer: flatly ""We don\'t have those anymore.""\nMe: *looks back at the menu* ""....Wasn\'t your grand opening yesterday?

No sentence required there  it speaks for itself. Great hot dogs and local beers make for a Charlotte staple. Been to both--Dilworth and Ballantyne.', ""Let's just cut to the chase. I was not incredibly impressed. We went to check it out last night since we have been craving a good hot dog. We left still craving a good hot dog. \n\nThe Coney Dog looked great but was bland  and the onion ring batter turned too hard when fried. I actually was concerned that it may crack a tooth. The Andouille sliders are a rip off. Twice the price of a regular dog and less than half the meat. The amount of meat in each of the 2 sliders was less than a single Little Smokie link. Basically tasted like mayo and bread.\nThe food isn't horrible  just not great. I won't be rushing back anytime soon."", 'I checked this place out for the Noda Cask Event.  I enjoyed the atmosphere and the tasty hotdog  the onion rings were too stringy for my taste.', ""This was interesting experience  we went in on a Saturday afternoon expecting it to be busy but to our surprise we were first in line. The food took about 5-10 min  which for hotdogs seems like a long time. I ordered a chili cheese dog  upon arrival I was disappointed because the cheese wasn't melted. Cheese just tastes and presents better melted  especially on a hotdog. I was hoping the chili would be hot enough to melt it if I let it sit there long enough but that was a negative. Anyways  the hotdog it's self tasted really good. \nOn a side note  the onion rings were disappointing. They tasted like the skins of onions? They were dry  shriveled up and greasy. \nI'm not sure if we just went on an off day but it sure seems like it. At the end of the day it's just hotdogs so I can't be mad. They had other things we wanted to try so if we're in the area we might consider this place again."", 'I guess the confused looks on our faces gave it away that we were first-timers! The cashier warmly greeted us and gave us a thorough introduction to the menu. This place does hot dogs (and other things) every way imaginable. All of the hot dogs have cute names. Hubby and I both went for the Char Heel Dog that had house-made chilli  slaw  diced onions (we skipped because we both had to go back to work) and yellow mustard. And you can get an all-beef dog! We both made ours combos; fries with cheese for me and tater tots for the hubby. Everything tasted great. And...they give a discount to CHS employees. Score!', ""I am a foodie but the simplicity of this place makes it endearing to me. It's all about the dogs and I've been here several times and always had great dogs. Love the onion rings and fries. I have not had the tots but I plan on it the next time. Hear they are delish. I will keep coming back."", 'I\'ve driven past JJ\'s dozens of times  and it\'s always seemed incredibly busy. It was such a beautiful day on Saturday I decided to take my dog for a walk through nearby Freedom Park and walk up from the park to grab some lunch. I\'m glad we finally decided to try this place! \n\nMy wife got the Dirty Jerz (pickled relish  onions  mustard  & sauerkraut) combo with a side salad. Hers was good (more of a traditional"" hot dog to me)  and the balsamic dressing was good! I opted for the Quarter Hounder (queso  bacon  lettuce  secret sauce) with the onion rings. My dog was phenomenal  the sauce/queso had a fantastic taste... The onion rings were okay  but nothing I would call ""infamous"" like they claim. Next time I\'ll probably opt for the cheese fries. \n\nBesides the awesome food  probably my favorite things are the cheap prices ($6.99 for any dog  side and drink) and their awesome rooftop seating. We were able to lounge up there with our little pooch and soak up the sun while we chowed down. Definitely a must stop during a jaunt down East Blvd.', ""We're Raleigh natives who happen to live for the moment in Charlotte. It took us 3 1/2 years but we FINALLY found a hot dog joint worthy enough to call ours. The Char Heel is my favorite & the onion rings are a dream come true. Thank you  JJ's! I'm bringing a couple of car loads of coworkers from Fort Mill to enjoy your great food again tomorrow! Love it!"", ""Hotdogs.  A staple in Amercia's pastime.  JJ's does them justice.  I'm talkin' real dogs y'all.\n\nIf you're looking for a chill place to have an old-fashioned hotdog  this is your joint.  Order your dog traditional style  or go with one of their fancy takes.  You can also build your own.  They have a few other options to choose from as well  including sausages  salmon sliders  etc.  Take your tykes because they have little dog choices too.  \n\nThe rooftop patio is a fun spot to eat if the weather is nice.  Be sure to stop by the pickle bar for a variety of housemate pickles.  Onion rings. Yes.  Fries.  Of course.  They even have a King of Pops cooler to satisfy your sweet tooth!\n\nHotdogs have gotten a bad rap over the years.  Don't view the hotdog as the underdog.  Go get your weiner on at JJ's!"", ""Maybe it was just a bad hot dog.. I had a burnt hot dog and my gf had extremely greasy onion rings neither of us could eat. I was craving a hot dog after eating gold star hot dogs in Kentucky. This was an extreme let down. I usually try to leave good reviews but this was my worse experience. \nWithin 30 minutes my stomach cramped up and I've been puking for a hour now."", 'JJ\'s may be serving red hots off of the grill  but their overall value and product is better described as luke warm.  In short  they grill up a competent enough dog in a great looking space  but be prepared to fork out a handsome price for the privilege.\n\nA walk thru the front door leads to a relatively open dining room with a mix of booths against the wall  a centralized bar area and tables out on the floor.  Props to the central light fixture/insider-refence to ""The Drum "" which was the original restaurant at this location.  You order from a central counter  where the menu is plastered against the wall .  The concept is informal and  aside from delivery of your order  everything is self-serve.  Credit is due here for a very polished and consistent look across the brand.\n\nThe focus  though  is mix of hot dogs and sausages.  All are chargrilled and then served on a potato bun.  The options are diverse and range from traditional to unique (e.g. a salmon sausage).  On my lunch trip  I tried the chicken and herb sausage which included grilled onions and peppers along with spicy remoulade.  It was tasty enough  but nowhere near a good value at $6.00.  It couldn\'t have been more than 4-5 decent sized bites.  Even the regular hot dogs go for $3.50 to $4.00 a piece and I would find it hard to think that just one was a filling lunch or dinner.\n\nTo make your \'red hot\' a combo will be another $2.49 and that gets you a fountain drink and a side.  For my side  I tried the ""soon to be infamous"" onion rings as I was told they were out of french fries (how does that happen?).  While the batter was unique as it had the look and consistency of tiny corn flakes  my order size was small and about of quarter of the overall portion was only the flakes of batter which were heavily laden with oil.  This order was soon to be forgotten.  The other two options: slaw and borracho beans  though I have not tried them  seem lackluster when compared to the hype given to the fries and rings.  Hopefully the portion sizes are larger.\n\nTo tally it up  I was $8.50 in just for my lunch and felt like I had very little to show for it.  Was this meal truly unique  I might see it as a special occasion kind of place.  But ultimately  and the real challenge here  for this concept to work is for JJ\'s to differentiate itself from any other restaurant that serves a hot dog or a sausage.  While there are a few things here you won\'t find elsewhere  at the end of the day it\'s still a hot dog or a sausage and side items that are largely commonplace  all in a self-serve setting.  JJ\'s hasn\'t elevated these items or the experience to a higher level and  consequently  I\'m left asking  ""Why pay the premium?""  For these red hots to catch fire  something more is needed.', 'Char heel was my favorite. We went on a Tuesday and hot dogs were buy one get one free! We paid $12 for 4 hotdogs and 2 sides. It was glorious and the food was great. We got the slaw and onion rings as sides  both good choices. We will definitely go back. Oh  and the service was friendly and speedy.', ""The hot dogs here are awesome! They have a great variety of unique toppings and of course the basics for those who prefer to keep it simple. The prices are also reasonable with meal combos and deals on Tuesdays (and other days  I believe). Don't forget to sign up for the rewards program! The service here is a step above the rest - truly great! They were extremely nice and attentive and happy to answer any questions. We will be back- next time at night so that we can take advantage of their great beer selection!"", 'My new favorite lunch spot. I get the 2 dog combo  and usually try the ""Dog of the Week"" I have yet to eat a hot dog that wasn\'t delicious from JJ\'s. Pair that with those delicious onion rings  and you have a winner...actually  it\'s about lunch time now  so I\'m headed out to JJ\'s.', 'A contender in any hot dog competition is JJ\'s Red Hots. For some reason my girlfriend has me craving hot dogs on a regular basis now and I have to say I have found the Charlotte  NC Madison Square Garden when it comes to dogs. Today I indulged in The Whistle Pig  all I can say is the 23 minutes and 19 seconds riding in the car to get here was well worth the 3 minutes it took me to eat the dog (I devour food). The dog is bigger than some sandwiches I have seen. It had the ""snap"" every dog should have on the first bite and it was also soooo flavorful. I mean I can actually taste the hot dog with all the toppings I had. The ambiance of JJ\'s Red Hots is awesome. The dining room is nice and open with tons of natural light. Its very inviting. Even though I was unable to make it to the roof it looked spectacular and comfortable.  I will most definitely be back to have a beer and a dog chillin\' on top of the roof.

I don't even like mustard. Booo I know I'm boring. However I was pleasantly surprised to have the pleasure of trying JJ's Red Hots at a yelp event. For someone who normally does not like mustard  both dogs that were offered had mustard on them. Oh man and did I scarf them down like no tomorrow. Today I had the pleasure of having anything on the menu on them as a thank you to veterans. The quarter hounder  and was it delicious! Bacon  queso  lettuce  tomato. With a drink and side of fresh house made chips served with ranch. I ate every bite! So far it's my third dog there  and I plan on trying all of them. The signature is awesome. Mustard  relish  onions and a dill pickle spear. And I will say this is not how I would normally want my hot dogs. I've also had the whistle pig with bacon  onions  mustard  and shredded cheese.

Pros:  the room  the bathrooms  etc. are well decorated and clean.  It\'s clear that the new owner has gone to great lengths to upfit his restaurant.  The staff seems friendly and nice.  There\'s even a take out window (which is opening ""soon"")  and a rooftop deck that show promise.  \nCons:  the food is just OK and not memorable.  We ordered Coney dogs. First of all  the hot dogs are grilled--the skin on ours was overcooked and crunchy.  Since we were there in the middle of the afternoon and the place was clearly overstaffed  we couldn\'t figure out why we\'d be served our hot dogs cooked this way unless it was intentional.  Secondly  if there was any chili our hot dogs  we couldn\'t taste it.  Very  very bland.  Thirdly  no french fries??? Seriously??? How is that even possible?  The onion rings were decent  but would have been much better if they had been accompanied by some ranch dressing--or anything to give them flavor.  \nI mentioned my thoughts to the manager who said he\'d pass the information along.  Maybe we will give JJ\'s another shot in a few months after they\'ve worked out the kinks.', 'The veggie dog option is great.  Just to note is tasty but not vegan.  The environment is fun and casual.  A nice place to kick back with friends or the family.  Try it you will love it.', ""Now let me first say hot dogs really aren't my thing  or more so weren't my thing. JJ's however has changed my view on hot dogs forever! This place is amazing! I stumbled upon it in the Dilworth area about a year ago. I gave it a try because of its retro theme and cute rooftop patio. I didn't realize they were famous for their dogs. \n\nThe first dog I tried was the dirty jerz (relish  onion  mustard  sauerkraut). It had the perfect amount of toppings to dog ratio. Also the hot dogs fit the buns perfectly so you're not stuck with extra bread.  My husband got the quarter hounder (queso  bacon  lettuce  tomato and special sauce). OMG! That dog changed my life. I wanted more!!!!! \n\nSince our first visit my husband and I have made it a tradition to go on a walk with our dog to freedom park followed by lunch or dinner at JJ's every week. It's a family tradition I hope to keep. \n\nI have also had the veggie dog  which was very good! You can't really even taste the difference! If you're a meat eater I dare you to try the veggie dog once. \n\nMy all time favorite dog has been a seasonal dog that features pimento and fried jalapeños!! It's bomb.com! The only dog I didn't really care for was the southwestern dog  but only because the beans were over powering. \n\nBesides the food  the staff has always been friendly and the owner even personally thanked us for coming in.

The hotdogs are grilled and delicious!  They have specialty dogs that would satisfy any palate!  I got the Char Heel Carolina style red hot.  It was cooked to perfection and topped with coleslaw and mustard.  It was served on a fresh roll and I got some of their house made carrots and pickles from their ""famous"" pickle bar.

The hot dogs were fine  but nothing spectacular. I\'m hoping their sausages have something more special about them? The chili topping was okay but not fab  and the Dirty Jerz is just your typical hot dog. We got some of their special ""Rocket Sauce"" on the side  and it looked like vomit. Seriously  like a grayish-pinkish chunky mess. It did not taste good.\n\nThe onion rings were very greasy  more like onion straws  with no crunch or anything to them. Basically just thin onions dipped in oil. The breading did not hold together whatsoever.\n\nThe lemonade apparently has basil in it  but I couldn\'t taste it.

Your dog will always have a crisp skin and taste like actual meat  just as it should be. Even next to the delicious hot dogs the sides do not disappoint. Try the sweet potato chips. You'll be hooked. I promise. The house made chips are excellent too and if your dog choice was not so south of the border  don't worry you can get a side of those tasty beans as well.  Top it all off with some selections from their pickle bar.\n\nNow you can have a soda to go with your meal  but you can also have one of the craft beers they have  both on tap and in cans.

JJ's is in the space occupied by The Drum restaurant  which operated from 1948 - 1995. Following the end of The Drum's operation several restaurants have opened and failed in this space. Judging from the new design  the level of enthusiasm and the quality of the food I think JJ's is here to stay!\n\nWe tried sample portions of most of the offerings and all were well-executed and tasty. JJ's uses smokehouse hot dogs from Sahlen's Packing Company in Buffalo  NY and the dogs are chargrilled over an open flame - yay for that charred smoky taste! Then come the toppings. There are eight signature hot dogs like the Char Heel (house-made chili  house-made slaw  diced onions and mustard) and my favorite: the Joliet Jake (Chicago style with tomatoes  sport peppers  diced onions  pickle relish  deli mustard  celery salt and pickle spear). You can also build your own with a long list of toppings  some of which are made in-house. House-made picked jalepenos and pickled vegetables are available at a self-serve bar near the soda fountain to top things off. I didn't try these during my visit but next time I'm definitely going to load up!\n\nJJ's also serves several specialty sausages including house-made smoked salmon sausage with quick-pickled cucumber  red onion and herb aioli - so tasty and a good option for the non-pork eating crowd. The chicken sausage with grilled onions and bell pepper was another favorite of mine but the andouille sausage sliders take the cake with delicious cole slaw on top. Bratwurst  Italian sausage and a Polish round out the sausage menu. Salads and homemade chili are also offered so yes  you could even take a vegetarian here - the onion rings and desserts are great too!"", ""When you think hot dogs  what comes to mind? Those nasty things rolling around in a gas station? Burnt sticks served at every cookout you go to? Rubbery  tasteless non-descript meat? Well  let JJ's change how you think of hot dogs. \n\nThey use quality encased meats (hot dogs & sausages from Sahlen's in NY) and top them with well thought out combinations of ingredients  ranging from ordinary to extraordinary! You can get a plain jane hot dog  a Chicago dawg  or many other signature creations. Don't like what they have... fine... make your own! They also offer sausages  chicken options  and vegetarian options. \n\nService is great and they always have some sort of special going. I'm just waiting for them to add sweet potato fries or tots... \n\nDon't miss out on this spot!"", 'These aren\'t your typical wimpy hot dog. This is a perfect quick lunch when you have late dinner reservations. I got the Chili Cheese Coney without the onions  my dad got the JJ\'s ""No. 1"" Red Hot  and my mom got a Chili Coney without cheese and onions. We also got a side of JJ\'s French Fries. My dog was good but the chili was super flavorful  my mom had the same feelings about her\'s. I will say my dog was a bit more burnt that i like so i would have preferred a little less char. My dad loved how chard the hot dog was and thought the toppings melded perfectly. I would definitely go back but i\'ll give it a little bit of time.', 'The hotdogs are amazing  I had the No. 1 and the Chilly slaw and both were very delicious. I got the onion rings and I loved how then they were.', ""I've been up and down East Blvd a zillion times and I've never stopped at JJ's - heard it was good... going out for hot dogs were never my thing. \n\nI went with a group of friends - got the double dog combo. The No. 1 original was good  right amount of mustard and onions. The second dog was the whistling pig; it was good... didn't taste the bacon much. The chips were good and their home made buttermilk ranch is pretty good - I would slather that on everything. Both dogs had a nice 'snap' to them which to me is the mark of a good dog. \n\nOverall a good place."", ""I went to JJ's this weekend for drinks with a large group of people. A few people in our party got hot dogs and seemed to enjoy them. The rooftop seating was pleasant  and there was a girl playing guitar and singing  which was fun.\n\nHowever  some parts of our experience were rather strange. After a few people asked for Miller and Bud and we realized they didn't have either  we asked for a beer menu. It turns out they serve a lot of local craft beers (yay!)  but they had one beer list for the entire rooftop seating area! Our server kept coming up to the table and taking the menu away from us every time she seated a new party so they could look at it. Then the beer list turned out to have factual errors--my boyfriend ordered a beer listed as an ESB on the menu and got quite a shock when they brought out an imperial stout--not what you want when you're sitting outside in 90 degree weather! (Note: this was not an issue of the server bringing the wrong beer--she brought the exact beer we asked for  but the actual menu was wrong!) I applaud the effort to serve nice beer to go with their fancy hot dogs  but if you're going to do so  you need plentiful and accurate menus."", 'I hired JJ\'s mobile trailer ""Frank the Tank"" for a birthday party and it was fantastic.  The quality of the food was great and the customer service was top notch.  The 2 guys who worked the event were fun and did a great job at the event.  We chose a wide variety to suit everyone\'s taste (red hot  brat  hot dog and chicken) and it was all delicious.  I would have them come cater my event again  it was an all around very good experience.', ""Y'all. JJ's takes hot dogs to a whole new level.

It's a culinary experience - designed to tickle your taste buds  and key into your other senses in pretty surprising ways.  \n\nBefore even getting into the food  it's worth mentioning that everything about the restaurant is well-designed  and gorgeous.  The menus are creative and fun  interior decoration is clever and well-themed  and the layout of the restaurant is stellar -- especially if the weather is nice and you can sit on the rooftop deck!\n\nI LOVE the hot dogs at JJ's.  Truly.  I've had several different combinations of hot dog type and toppings  including some of their crazy dog-of-the-days (The Elvis  for example  had peanut butter  honey  and banana chips on it!).  They're well made  and delicious.  even when there's a line to order  food never takes long.\n\nI will admit that the one thing that's lacking for me is the sides - I've had the beans  fries  onion rings  and chips  and they're all relatively forgettable.  I usually stick to 2 dogs and a drink.  \n\nMy favorite hot dog? Rocket sauce  bacon bits  and cole slaw.  Yum.\n\nKeep an eye on JJ's instagram account for specials and contests  too."", ""Went to JJ's on opening day. The restaurant itself is cool and I like the rooftop patio  especially because the weather is so nice here in Charlotte most of the year. But the food was just - okay. I know it's just a hot dog joint so I guess I shouldn't set the bar too high  but at the end of the day  the dogs weren't good enough to justify the price - which wasn't expensive. It's just hard to get around the idea that I could grill a dozen dogs on my back patio for the same price that would be twice as good. Long story short  wanted to like this place but I wasn't convinced. Might try it one more time once they've been open longer."", ""Yummy hotdogs  yummy toppings. Glad they finally got combos added to their menu  it's a bit pricey for the size dog you get but the combo adds a better deal now. Yummy pickle bar. The carrots with ginger is awesome!!

I decided to take the boyfriend some lunch and figured we'd try something new... \n\nI love everything about Chicago except the cold winters and the Bears  so I got the Joliet Jake or Chicago Style dog... It was awesome... The boyfriend is a little less adventurous  so I ordered him a Coney with no onions... The dogs were both grilled to perfection... The toppings on my dog were perfect... Not too little  but not too much  either... The boyfriend enjoyed his dog as well... He doesn't enjoy the burnt hot dogs like I do  so he was very happy with the way his was cooked...  I ordered the fries for him in a medium because I wasn't sure if he'd like them and apparently I under-ordered... lol  I understood once I had them  though... Nice and crispy with no limpness from grease... My onion rings were great... Sometimes I like a nice  light batter with thin slices of onion... This batter has just the right amount of spice as well... \n\nI loved the to-go containers... You know how most places just give you a hot dog wrapped in aluminum foil and you end up with a soggy bun from the condiments? None of that here!  It's an actual container that gives the toppings enough room to stay on top of the dog without falling all over the sides... \n\nThey were efficient  friendly and very helpful...  Fabulous time... Highly recommended!"", ""I wanted to love this place  and I really don't want to give a mean review but here's what I found. \n\nTables and floors....filthy on a Sunday afternoon.

They have tons of different kinds that will have you coming back just to try a new one. Don't expect your average everyday backyard hot dog. JJs goes above and beyond to craft up some seriously good dogs. \n\nJJs is a staple in Charlotte and well deserving of the hype. Customer service is awesome. You order at the counter and they bring the food out to you. Even if you are sitting all the way up top on their rooftop patio!! \n\nThey are constantly dreaming up new flavors so stay tuned to their social media for updates. Their tots are amazing but onion rings were not. Their pictures looks great on the menu but they could work on the final products when they are served. However above all the flavor was on point which is all that really matters to me."", ""A good hot dog? yes.  Five stars good? No way.  \nI have driven by plenty of times and thought about stopping but I have to be in a certain mood to have hot dogs  so when my daughter wanted to take me out for Father's day  I decided it was time to check out JJ's.\n\nWe arrived at 11:30 and I was surprised to find that we were the only people in the place. Usually not a good sign  but I had read so many glowing reviews we assumed that the rush would catch up with us later.\n\nThere was plenty of help behind the counter and they were eager to take our order. I had the Char dog with mustard  chili and slaw  my daughter had the Fryder man which had cheese  chili and french fries on the dog. We both had fries and we got an order of onion rings to share. I'll list the highs and lows:\n\nService was very good and the gang behind the counter was attentive but the kitchen was a little slow since we were the only ones there. Not too bad if you consider they make everything from scratch but keep it in mind if you plan to run in for a quick lunch and are on a schedule.\n\nThe star of the show is their hot dogs and their wieners were very good.  Nice char  mildly seasoned and clean tasting.  Natural casing made for a nice bite.  They are so mild that the flavor of the wiener is lost with most of the toppings.  Chili was good and reminded me of my Mom's homemade recipe.  The buns taste like a potato bun and they are nicely toasted but nothing special.\n\nFrench fries are just OK.  could be frozen  i don't know. They are cooked well but nothing special.  Mine were a little greasy.  The onion rings were a big disappointment.  The first order was cold.  I mean like they had been in the refrigerator cold. They cooked us another order but by that time we were halfway through our dogs.  They were very greasy and not all that good anyway.\n\nWe got a couple dogs to go and i like the to-go containers.  Kept them safe and sound all the way home.\n\nBottom line is they make a good hot dog  everything else seems to suffer.  If I go back I will try the sausages  they had a pretty good selection.  If you are into crazy topping combinations and locally brewed beer on the roof  then this is probably your place."", 'Paul\'s YER (Yelp Elite Rating):\n\nFirst time here. It\'s always so friggin\' busy that I couldn\'t ever find a place to park. So i came on a Saturday afternoon at 230pm. Odd time. Not busy. My strategy worked!\n\nGot the double dog combo: Joliet Jake Chicago Dog (had to see how close it is to a real Chicago dog) and a Quarter Hounder. After biting into the Chicago dog I quickly realized that this is most definitely NOT a ""Chicago dog."" This is a BUFFALO DOG (Saleen grilled dog) with Chicago style toppings. But was it good? YES! Authentic? Not at all.\n\nThe Quarter Hounder....hum. Well it was suppossed to basically be a Bacon Dog. Well it had bacon but the bacon was chewy and not crisp at all. Flavor was good but that bacon just can\'t be soggy and chewy guys!\n\nThe onion rings were recommended and they were of the very thin variety but very flavorful. Not as crisp as I\'d like but the taste was there.\n\nNow the staff was EXCELLENT! Rastafarian dude at the front counter was AWESOME! Super friendly and cool. Everyone served you with a smile. Place is ""Diner Chic"" and cool inside.\n\nI will be back to try their sausages and other dogs. Just recognize that their Dogs are BUFFALO STYLE which means GRILLED Saleens. Very good indeed but don\'t expect steamed or boiled dogs.\n\nOverall I\'d recommend JJ\'s.', 'I love hot dogs. There  I said it. I always feel like less of a foodie whenever I have one  but I don\'t care. Hot dogs  FTW. \n\nThe hot dogs at JJ\'s are hot dogs unlike any I\'ve ever had. The dog itself is whatever. It\'s a hot dog. But the toppings  and more importantly the combination of toppings is what takes these to the next level. \n\nGraham was traditional and boring with his dog. He had the Char-heel  which was a combination of slaw  chili  raw onions and mustard. I loathe all of those toppings  so I wouldn\'t touch it with a ten foot pole. But in his words it was ""effing delicious"". \n\nI had the dog of the week (the big cheesy)  and oh baby... It was topped with bacon  jalepeno pimento cheese & pickled jalepeno. One word to describe it: epic. The pimento cheese was so good. It\'s not a combination I would have ever put together on my own  but it definitely worked! \n\nWe both had our dogs with chili cheese fries (which were fantastic) and best of all  it was SO CHEAP! $15 for everything  including two sodas.', ""Came into JJ's last night for their all-you-can-eat hot dog special occurring on select Thursday nights.  I arrived an grabbed a table on their upstairs patio.  It was a perfect afternoon/evening and the patio is a great outdoors space.  Conveniently  the hot dog was set-up out there.\n\nOn the bar were buns  hot dogs  chili  baked beans  relish  pickles  brown mustard  onions  and shredded cheese.\n\nFor $6 it was a great deal.  Our great stayed for the whole time the bar was out (5-8) and had a gluttonous amount of hot dogs.  The dogs themselves were very good.  The buns are thick potato buns which I normally very much enjoy but they are extremely filling.  The chili on the bar had an odd after taste for me.  I wish there was slaw on the bar too to do the full carolina dog.\n\nI tried the onion rings which had a nice spicy crust.\n\nPBR was $2 and they had them cold and for sale upstairs which made everything easy.\n\nI'd definitely return to JJ's to try some of their more unusual dogs but the hot dog bar was a huge hit for me and my friends."", ""I LOVE WIENERS!  I like'em charred and/or grilled  not boiled.  Not ever.  Once you forget a wiener on the stove in boiling water and are reminded by the exploding sound  you will never eat a boiled wiener again.  I spent my tween and early teen years with season tickets with the fam to a AAA baseball team in Virginia.  I lived on chili cheese foot-longs for 4 months out of the year.  You would think I would have gotten tired of the dog.  Alas.... my love for the wiener endures.  \n\nEnter JJ's Red Hots.  I have been wanting to go since they opened  but it's location is just a tad too far for me to make it for lunch during the work-week  and my laziness makes it too much of a hike on the weekends for just a hot dog.  What do you do when you go into the office on the Friday after a Thursday holiday and no one is in the office?  You take an executive lunch and drive around Dilworth looking for wieners and inappropriate items from Paper Skyscraper.  \n\nMy order of a chili cheese coney (no onions) with fries arrived promptly and smoking hot.  Good char on the dog.  Cheese was melting over the chili.  The chili was fine  nothing that rocked my world  but good enough  maybe could have used a splash of hot sauce.  I did the unthinkable to hot dog purists and dumped ketchup on it  but that's how I roll.  The bun was soft and fresh and held all of the ingredients in place so I didn't end up with chili on my rack.  Coke products to drink  including real Cherry Coke (yum!).  The fries were fine  nothing special (I will try the chips next time for something different).   The total for my dog + fries + drink was $7.01.  Good price for lunch and reasonable for what I got. \n\nThey have an interesting pickle bar.  I tried the quick pickles and they were delicious.  They also had ginger carrots  pickled onions  and .... other stuff (not sure  I wasn't in a pickle mood today).\n\nThere was hardly anyone in the place at 11:30 (early for lunch)  I am sure everyone was dogged out from yesterdays July 4th festivities.  It was easy to find (if you are heading away from South Blvd  it will be on your right).  Parking  in typical Dilworth fashion  was a bit of an angled mess  but it looks like it could handle a pretty steady lunch crowd without getting too crazy.  \n\nJJ's gets a 3 1/2  which I rounded up.  I will be back to try other variations  along with their sausages and *maybe* even a veJJie in honor of our Yelpin' veJJie  JJ.  Nothing that changed my life  but a great place if you are craving a wiener.\n\nNote:  A Ballantyne location is coming soon - I think I read towards the end of July 2013 after they get their permits and such in place."", 'Eh. The best part was the free tots for checking in on yelp. Not sure if it was an off day or what  but the dogs were burnt  the ""bacon"" in the whistle dog was charred bac-o-bits  and the mustard was very overpowering.

One dog I got with rocket sauce and slaw and one with the cilantro lime crema and grilled onions and peppers. Both were amazing but the crema with onions and peppers was my favorite! My husband also got a veggie dog combo with fries. We were so shocked with how they looked and tasted that we went back in to make sure they were veggie  they were! We couldn't hardly believe it! We also got a free onion ring with our order because we used the yelp deal! The onion rings were ok but nothing I would probably order again  they were very greasy and the breading didn't stay on super well. \nThey had a good beer selection and we were able to get drafts for $2 each!

It just has a ton of \'stuff\' on it  so lots of good things are happening with each bite.  For a side  I highly recommend their chips  which are seasoned  crispy  and served with a nice side of ranch dressing for dipping.\n\nThe atmosphere/seating is really nice as well.  You can sit in a booth or at high tables.  The tables are also huge and have great views of the televisions.  JJ\'s would probably be a good place to enjoy some hot dogs and watch some baseball games...or any other sport.\n\nI also loved the amount and variety of condiments/pickled vegetables.

The pototo rolls that the dogs are served on are very soft and are served warm.  Try the Weiner the Pooh dog- peanut butter  honey and bacon.  Trust me  its good!  The sweet tea is awesome but give the OrangeAde a shot  very refreshing!"", 'This place serves up some excellent wieners (and sausages)  but an excellent wiener doesn\'t automatically insure an excellent hot dog - whatever version you\'re having - one of their Signature Hot Dogs  or one you choose to build yourself. The wiener is only part of the composition of a great hot dog  the most important part  but still just a part. The roll  the toppings (individually and collectively)  cooking method  and finally the assembly process itself will determine the ultimate pedigree of the dog - Best of Breed  Mutt  or something in between.\n\nWe tried 3 Signature Hot Dogs - JJ\'s ""No.1"" Red Hot  The Char Heel  and The Joliet Jake (Chicago Style) - and I was underwhelmed with all 3 from the point of view of taste  texture  and composition. The very first think you notice when you unwrap the dog (any one of them) is the omnipresence of the color yellow (check out the photos) - the mustard  rather sharp mustard at that  is applied last  and with a heavy hand. On the first 2 Signature Dogs we tried  the mustard is applied to a large layer of slaw  and these 2 items overwhelm all other aspects of the hot dog - the excellent wiener gets lost  as do the other toppings  which are fairly small quantities to begin with - in fact  I don\'t know if I like their chili or not  never found enough to taste. These 2 dogs cost $3.49.\n\nThe Joliet Jake ($3.99) is not an outstanding version of the Chicago style dog. There were no whole Sports Peppers  the tomato was limited  and the Pickle Relish was bland  and the deli mustard was applied last and too liberally for my taste. I do not care for Potato Rolls  in general  and this one didn\'t change that opinion. All in all  these heavy hot dogs are overpriced  and do not rock you with flavor  mainly for the reasons mentioned. I would not order any of the 3 dogs we tried as they were served.\n\nI went back  and ordered a simple dog with Sauerkraut and mustard  with the mustard applied before the kraut  and this was a very good dog  showcasing the excellent wiener  but cost $3.99 - very much over-priced. I don\'t consider this a hot dog destination kind of place  especially not in the Charlotte area  which boasts a number of outstanding dogs  include the Southern Chili Dog at Green\'s Lunch  a variety of good dogs by The Chili Man  and a number of very good Chicago Dog choices  including the outstanding one at Poppa\'s in Mooresville.\n\nI imagine this place could do very well  it is the trendy kind of place some folks flock to - look at the success of Skippy\'s and their Pretzel bun in Winston - but I\'ll probably not be one of the flock here.

We asked if we could send them back for ones that were not burnt. The server was bothered by that  she grabbed it and took off in a huff......like we I was  a real imposition.  The real imposition came when roaches appeared crawling on the wall above our table.  When our food came we could not eat it.  I thought if there are roaches on the walls in the dining area...the kitchen must be crawling with them. It was disgusting.', ""We stopped by JJ's later in the afternoon on their opening day  which was July 4th.  We were happy to see that the line had died down  because when we passed by the place about an hour earlier  there was a line wrapped around the building.  When we got inside  there was still a line to the ordering counter  but it moved pretty quick.  We were meeting several friends here so a couple of us got in line to order while others got a few tables together for our large group.  I had the bratwurst with sauerkraut and deli mustard  which was awesome  and the wife got the herb chicken sausage added to her salad.  Yeah you heard me right  she got a salad.  She enjoyed her mixed green chopped salad and the balsamic vinaigrette  and the chicken sausage made in-house was awesome.  We also ordered a couple of beer from their four taps.  On tap beers were local NoDa Brewing  OMB and a Foothills IPA. They also serve several beers from cans and red/white wine by the glass.  We also tried some of the dogs and I would need to return to eventually try them all.  Looking forward to getting a whistle pig next time.\n\nThe main issue with JJ's  when we were there  was the chaos that was their opening day.  Once the staff has a few shifts under their belts and they work the kinks out  I hope JJ's will be around for a long time.  They offer a very reasonably priced menu for Dilworth and what I assume will continue to be a stellar beer selection.  They also need to figure out a better way to order another beer other than going back up to the counter  especially  if they are planning on having groups of people hanging out at the restaurant."", 'Favorite place for hotdog and onion rings.

Coke. \n\n* * * * * LOVES * * * * *\n-- I loved the location  and the chill rooftop seating.\n-- I loved the restaurant\'s cool lay out  decor  and the high ceilings. \n-- I loved the pumping blues music that puts energy into the room.\n-- I loved the friendliness of the employees  and the fact that they know how to smile. \n-- I loved the cleanliness of the restaurant.\n-- I loved that the owner\'s/manager\'s are present and involved.\n\n* * * * *  LIKES * * * * *\n-- I liked the taste of the Char Heel. The charred wiener imparts a delicious campfire grilled taste to the hot dog. My first bite was delicious  after that - meh  not so much. \n-- I liked that the drink dispenser had Cherry Coke. \n-- I liked the multiple seating options: booths  tables  and raised bar seating. \n-- I liked that there was a fairly large parking lot. \n-- I liked that the bathroom was clean.\n-- I liked their pickle bar.\n-- I liked that they had Dale\'s Pale Ale and other quality beers available. It was overpriced  but it was available. \n\n* * * * * DISLIKES * * * * *\n-- I did not like the Joliet Jake Chicago hot dog. It was about what I expected - no thank you  Chicago can keep it. \n\n-- I did not care for the flimsy  barely warm  super greasy  sad excuse for onion rings. They remind me of the onion rings that are designed to be put atop a burger at places like Pinky\'s. I would not order them again. McKoy\'s Smokehouse and Sauceman\'s Barbecue have FAR superior onion rings. \n\n-- I cringed when I saw that my bill for two hot dogs  broken up  greasy  onion rings  and a soda - was over $10.00. A hot dog should never cost $3.49 each  much less $3.99 for the Chicago dog. \n\n-- I did not like the fifteen minute wait for my order  given that there were only three dudes in front of me  inside the otherwise empty restaurant.  \n\n-- I HATED that there was a sign in the parking lot that said that I was subject to having my car towed if I parked in the wrong place. Welcome to Charlotte!\n\nSUMMARY: An above average hot dog  selling for triple of average prices.', ""Delicious! Soooooooo good! When I say this  I don't mean meh  these hotdogs are good (ish). They're the bomb! So many choices! The pricing is spot on and not too expensive but not so cheap that you think they bought ingredients at the dollar store. Don't get me wrong  I love the dollar store but not for food! ;) Hubby and I ate here with friends and we all had a great experience! Good atmosphere  family friendly  and quick service!"", ""When it comes to JJ's I would listen to NIKE and Just Do It. And while your at it get the Carolina dog and the onion rings."", 'Interesting spin on hot dogs. I was surprised and happy with what they had to offer. I will most certainly return.', 'Kids were given uncooked corn dog bites  twice. Not very impressed with our adult meals either. We had a chicken ""sandwich"" but it had several large chunks of fat  and a hotdog. Not even worth the kids eat free night.', ""I feel bad reading all these great reviews and not loving this place myself?!? It's mediocre at best. The actual hot dog tastes like bologna to me  but they do cook it so that it has a nice crisp. The chili tasted like a can  but I swore they said it was homemade? They use great buns and we did enjoy the onion rings. I didn't hate it  but hot dogs are so easy to make at home that I wouldn't bother coming here again. Maybe if I'm in the neighborhood again  I'll give them one more try! The restaurant itself was clean and interesting to look at!"", 'I wanted to love this place  I really did. \nBest thing I had was the cherry coke \nHot dog meat was forgettable  chili was blamd  buns dry.\nGood quality cheese thou.\nCool staff  clean place.', ""Definitely the best hot dog place in Charlotte. Highly recommend. I'm originally from Chicago so I promise you I know good hot dogs and this is definitely a place you want to try. You will not be disappointed"", ""I think I'll have to go back \nThey have lots of different options & fountain Cheerwine.\nStaff was nice & food came quickly."", ""If you haven't been to JJ's  are you really living? This place is a Charlotte staple! Great location  friendly workers  interesting decor with a lot to look at while you eat  and most importantly  delicious hotdogs! They use Sahlen's hotdogs from Western NY which are the best of the best. Lots of great combinations and options  I haven't had anything here yet that has let me down. \n\nTo make this place EVEN better you'll also find King of Pops right outside with their delicious popsicles! Hotdogs  popsicles  ahh  childhood!\n\nGive these weenies a try!"", ""After seeing this on Diners  drive in's and dives like everyone else I simply had to try it. We tried four different hot dogs and loved them all. The chili cheese dog was incredible as well as the take on the Chicago dog (i forget what they called theirs) the toppings bar with pickles and and other cool choices was super unique. The only down side was the sides  we tried the beans and cole slaw and didn't care for either one. The cole slaw had no flavor what so ever and the beans were simply not what I was expecting. I will return for the hot dogs soon and skip the sides."", ""Hubby wanted to try this place for a while.  We went there during lunch time on a Wed..not very busy..uh-oh.  The menu looks really good.  Everything sounds enticing.   Hubby likes bratwurst.  We ordered a bratwurst and a Chicago style.  Opps - they are out of bratwurst - I thought the menu said housemade (how can you be out of them).  so hubby got something else - let's just say that if it's not a hot dog - it's going to be more than $6 and that is just plain expensive for something on a bun with kraut and mustard. My Chicago style dog was burnt  which seems to be common place based on other reviews.  I didn't mind but it was just ok.  I did like the toppings on the Chicago style.  The homemade chips are good. I think IF we come back  we will stick to the hot dogs and ask them not to burn them.\nUpdate: was contacted by the manager and he offered a free bratwurst when we come back.  I'll give an update when we get to do that."", ""I finally visited JJ's even though I've know Jon Luther for several years now. I had the 2 dog combo. I had the Char Wheel and the Chicago dog. Both were perfect  though very different. The onion rings and the house cut fries were both fantastic  but add the chili and cheese to the fries for perfection. I'll have to go back soon because I need to try every item on the menu. And do not skip the pickle bar. Great job Jon!!"", ""I expected greatness from this restaurant with their outstanding reviews. however when a group of friends and I went here for a friday afternoon lunch we were served black and crispy hot dogs. I lo a good chargrilled dog but these were so burnt that we all just left and ate at one of the many better places close by. If you're looking for the taste of black char and some cancer causing carcinogens- look no further- JJ's burnt dogs is the place for you."", ""The price is right and the food is good! The inside is nicely decorated and well lit. They have 2 dollar hot dogs on Tuesdays. Lots of different choices in how to get your hotdog 'fixed'. I also love the pickle bar but I am a sucker for pickles. Ok selection of beer at decent prices. I'll be back!"", ""Can't beat JJ's for the best dogs in town!  Love the Char Heel and the German bratwurst with sauerkraut  yum yum.  The homechips are a must and the side salad was even delicious.  An excellent choice for lunch or dinner any day of the week.  We frequent this local hotspot a few times a month and are never disappointed."", 'What a nice hot dog joint! JJ\'s had a Groupon and I just couldn\'t resist the temptation of a good deal and a new place to try. \n\nI\'m on my veggie kick and while they do not have veggie dogs on their regular menu  they offered a portabello sausage on the day I was there. Tempting as it was  I choose their chopped salad with salmon sausage on top. Even though salmon sausage sounds kind of funny  it made for a flavorful dish! I was really impressed at the size and quality of their salad. I also got a milkshake...it was more on the milky side than thick side. \n\nThe staff are really friendly and completely clean conscious. There was always someone cleaning  sweeping  or tidying up. The interior is fantastic and fun with excellent lighting. They offer a tremendous special on Fridays for an ""all-you-can-eat"" hot dog bar. Wow  go dogs!\n\nI\'m a fan and hope you are too!', 'This place has great hot dogs. I really liked that they offer veggie dogs  which is AWESOME! Because of this  I will definitely come more often. \n\nThe staff was very helpful on explaining their different kinds of hot dog style choices and sides.', ""The vibe in this place to me is what sets it apart from other places. Food I got was just okay  but that's just speaking on two dogs I ordered.  The menu had a lot of different toppings and it was hard for me to chose  so I just took the workers recommendation. This is a place you should experiment with if you really like hotdogs and feeling a little adventurous. Something different from your average burger joint in my opinion."", ""When you are craving a hot dog  or even if you're not craving a hot dog  go to JJs. Super affordable and extremely inventive. I have to come back and try their homemade sausage because I already know the hot dogs are great. They have a wonderful upstairs and downstairs patio in the dilworth location and even when they are busy the food gets out very quickly. Love the pimento cheese and that they carry local beers!"", ""I generally don't like chain restaurants but I can totally see why people think that this could be a successful national chain.  The space is extremely comfortable and inviting while incorporating local touches.  The staff was super friendly and the dogs were outstanding.  This is a Triple D restaurant for good reason.  The menu choices were vast and inventive and paired will with the local beer selection.  I will certainly hit this place us the next time I am in the area.  Even better than advertised."", ""I've been hearing great things about this popular hotdog place and wanted to try it for a while. When my boyfriend and I were passing by we decided to stop in so I could try it. Being from buffalo  I automatically loved that they had our infamous salens hot dogs and were charcoal grilled! There were many different varieties of toppings to chose from but I just wanted the typical toppings nothing too crazy. We got fries to share as well. All the food was great and service was fast which was surprising as they were pretty busy. My only complaint is that they didn't have vinegar for French fries! It's my favorite and a popular thing to put on them and was disappointed! Everything else was great though. They even have a little side bar of toppings of pickled veggies that you can add yourself or on the side."", ""Awesome and fresh fries!  Go for the larger 100% pure beef dog for $1 extra as it's TOTALLY worth it!  The unique toppings are terrific and the veggie options make this a great place to dine with all your friends!!  Best dogs in Charlotte!"", ""Stopped in on several recommendations and I'm glad I did.  Nice no tension environment.  I had the Chili Cheese Coney combo and it was great  the price was right as well!   Thanks JJ!"", 'This is an awesome spot to get your dawg fix.  Especially after some activity at Freedom Park  you gotta get those calories back up.  We went on a busy Saturday... had to park on the street a block down because their lot was full.  The line seemed long  but moved quickly.  Service was very friendly and efficient!\n\nI grabbed drinks and some goodies from the homemade pickle bar.  They have wonderful pickled onions and other veggies.\n\nAfter maybe 5 minutes of waiting our food was brought to the table.  I ordered the Kasemeister  a cheese stuffed sausage with pickled onions  sauerkraut  and horseradish mustard.  SO good!  My side was onion rings... which a lot of them were missing batter but they were still tasty.\n\nMy kiddos loved the food!  One got a pb&j slider (the shame!) and one got a skinless dog.  Both got gobbled up.  It was a successful lunch.', ""Solid 4 stars. If you're into hot dogs with many unique toppings  this is your place. I'm more of a Vienna Beef boiled dog kind of guy but it's tough to find a good hot dog joint in Charlotte. \n\nI've been a few times and it's been consistently good every time. First time I was there  owner came out to talk to me. Very friendly and you could tell he cared about his product. \n\nWill definitely be back."", ""Craving for a hot dog and want one that has more than Sam's Club or Costco has to offer?  COME. HERE.  Roofio would say that this place is BANGARANG!\n\nYou'll find this place in it's own still standing building  and sometimes you'll see that King of Pops is in front as well.  Yummolicious!  Just be prepared to that this place has a small parking lot.  I couldn't tell you where else you can park cause I've always been lucky enough to get a parking spot.\n\nWhen you walk in  you can just order and pay at the counter.  I seem to always get the same thing  the Chili Cheese Coney  and I NEVER regret ordering it.  I seriously need to venture out and try all the other items on the menu  but my husband does that so I just steal bits of his order cause...marriage.  Try ordering a side of their fries and add the chili and cheese.  Yum yum.  When I order just one dog and a side  I always feel full as it hits the stomach just right.\n\nThey have dining inside where there are booths  and high tops.  There is also outside dining right near the door  and also on the rooftop!  If it's nice out  I suggest to sit outside on the rooftop as it's a nice view  and I like watching the traffic go bye while eating.\n\nAll in all  definitely check this place out.  Heck  it's also been visit by Guy Fieri and featured on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives if that tells you anything."", ""Love me a good Hot Dog  I don't think I got the full JJ's experience. I didn't even see half the dogs that were advertised at our table on the flip chart with photos. You can also only use one promotion when you come in  - I had an offer for BOGO hot dogs and onion rings and had to choose one - so I haven't got to have the rings yet....sad days!\n\nI'll be back again and will get the full experience and update this review!"", ""I LOVED this place! It's not just the amazing hot dog and fries I got  or the fact that I can in expecting to spend $15 and was surprised to find a Tuesday night special (all dogs for $2 people!!!) so it was only $7. It's about the experience. I see all different kinds of people here  cool music  a wall of license plates above the register. This place has a cool factor of 9000. The patient staff isn't even bothered by the fact that it's technically closed and the dining room is still half full.  this is my new Tuesday night spot."", ""Best damn dogs i've ever had... i had to have 2.. OK maybe 3..."", ""I ordered the Kasekreiner (House Made) sausage today  it was very good. JJ's is a great place to grab a quick bite. They have daily specials on food and drinks. Don't get me wrong it's not a high end evening dining place but for a hotdog/sausage place it is the best. They made a house made venison sausage several years ago that was so good it haunts me to this day  I wish it was a regular menu item. Oh and the staff have always been very nice  friendly  kind  gracious  and helpful."", ""It's the middle of the afternoon and you're wondering around Dilworth.  You want some casual food  but you just don't want to commit to table service.  Where do you go?\n\nI wondered over to JJ's Red Hots in the middle of the afternoon on a Tuesday (don't tell my boss).  It's super casual.  You walk in  order your food at the counter  sit wherever you want and they bring you your food within minutes.  Perfect when you need to get back to the office before people start wondering where you are.\n\nYou can't beat $2 signature dogs on Tuesdays after 3pm.  YEAH!  I had the Quarter Hounder with a whole lot of pickles from the condiment bar  and it was delicious!  Although it was too early to start drinking (come on  I do have some standards during work hours)  they seem to have a great selection of local beers.  I'm pretty sure I'll be back on the weekend when it's warm enough to sit upstairs and throw back a cold one while enjoying the view.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to hang out with friends over some beers and some yummy unhealthy food (healthy eaters  you can have a veggie dog and a side salad)...this is the place for you.  See you all in the summer on the roof deck!"", ""JJ's is a reliable spot for a quick lunch or dinner. Our favorite day to go is Tuesday when it's $2 signature dogs and $2 beers. \n\nThe Sonoran and Whistle Pig are my favorite. The fries and tots (free Yelp check in!) are also good. They also have a loyalty program where you can additional discounts and freebies - good for the wallet  bad for the belly. :-)\n\nThe rooftop is nice when the weather is good. The only challenge is parking can be a little hard to navigate. \n\nKeep slinging them dogs   JJ's!"", ""I spent 2 months working in Charlotte and JJ's was often a go-to lunch spot for my coworkers and I.\n\nThey have a great selection of different hot dog types and even have vegetarian and turkey options.  I usually don't even like hot dogs  but JJ's makes some amazing hot dogs.  The pricing is also very fair for the quality and quantity of food you receive. \n\nThe atmosphere is comfortable and they even have a rooftop dining area if the weather is nice!  The service was always excellent and the employees always seemed upbeat.  \n\nI definitely recommend this place and I will be back next time I'm in Charlotte!"", ""Such a cute restaurant and really good service; however  I don't think the hot dogs are worth 4 bucks a pop.

Great rooftop for people/sunset watching. Live music on Tuesdays. Good food!', ""JJ gives me my hot dog fix every time and wouldn't have it an other way! I go with the Char-heel which is very simple but my favorite!! From the chili  the mustard  the onions  even the bun! This hot dog is every hot dog lovers dream! if that's not enough convincing for you wait until you try the onion rings I don't even know what other side options there are because I cant get away from those dang onion rings!! Those little strings of love will have you drooling for more  guaranteed! No JJ's visit is complete without the infamous Ogre sauce of course. This sauce paired with those onion rings are a match made in heaven! They sell it by the bottle. Buy some. You're welcome. They have a pickle bar too where they have a number of different pickled toppings. My absolute favorite are the spicy pickles I make sure to leave with a few of those for the road! JJ's is family friendly so bring everybody! Hands down the best hot dog place in Charlotte  its sure to please!"", ""I think my experience was like a lot of others on here.  I was really looking forward to trying JJ's  but was underwhelmed after the meal.\n\nThe decor is great and it's a cool spot.  I stopped in after watching my Noles get a win on a Saturday night and the place was dead at 10pm.  I guess a hot dog place is more of a lunch destination  but I thought there might be some other drunken college football fans looking for some food to soak up all the booze from the afternoon.  I kind of got the suspicion it was dead for a reason.....\n\nWe tried an assortment of hot dogs  the onion rings  and the nachos.  The nachos were on special for $2 and they were definitely the highlight of the meal!  I was expecting tortilla chips  but they came with crunchy kettle chips topped by beans  cheese  and salsa.  The kettle chips added a nice crunch and stayed crispy even though they were topped with salsa.  The hot dogs were 'Meh'.  First of all  they came with buns that were right out of the bag.  They weren't toasted or steamed or even MICROWAVED.  The hot dogs were also charred black.  I like my dogs crispy  but not completely charred.  Do you need to specify that?  I did order a 'Charheel'  but damn.  Maybe they should rename the place 'JJ's Black Hots'.  The hot dogs themselves aren't even that great.  I like all beef dogs like Nathan's  but these tasted like the cheap 'grocery store' brand.  You know what I'm talking about.  The onion rings weren't good either.  They were served cold  but I had already eaten half of the small basket before I thought to say anything.  Remember  I was there after a long day of beer drinking.\n\nThere could be some potential here  but I will be going for the more expensive sausages if I make it back.  The hot dogs just weren't that great in my opinion."", 'Great hot dogs and super service! I got the char dog and the whistle pig and my husband got dirty jerk and the Joliet and we loved them both! He got tots and I got onion rings. So good! When we go back I want a plain dog I think because the hot dog is THAT GOOD! The gentleman working the counter was wonderful and asked if we had ever been there before and we told him it was our first time and he took extra time to help us decide what we wanted and even brought us to go menus and stickers to our table! Customer service alone would bring us back but the hot dogs and onion rings are a huge bonus!', 'Just a great place. Onion rings are awesome  hot dogs are perfect. They have great staff.

My favorite dogs have come from the specials section.\n\nDon\'t forget to check out the pickle bar.  I know what your thinking... What is a pickle bar?  They pickle carrots   cucumbers  peppers  and a few other things  and you can just grab some.  Your supposed to put them on your dog (I think)  but I always just snack on them add I wait for my food.\n\nThe prices are reasonable  the location is trendy  and the dogs are delicious.  Five Stars all day.', 'First  let me state that I want this place to succeed.  It\'s in a great location and there\'s not really anything similar in the area.  Getting hot dogs on a Saturday afternoon has been a longtime routine of mine.\n\nPros:\nThe hot dogs I got(the Char Heel) were fine.  Nothing really to complain about there.  Chargrilled and potato rolls  can\'t go wrong.\n\nI love the location  the atmosphere  the patio  the deck.  I especially like paying tribute to the original tenant at that location  The Drum.  nice touch!\n\n\nCons:\nThe main reason I couldn\'t give a rating higher than 3 is because they said they had taken french fries off of the menu.  How can you have a hot dog place and not have french fries?!?!  Perhaps the cashier misspoke.  Because considering the place was not even a week old  and to already take something off of the menu  seems like an odd decision.\n\nMy next complaint  and it is minor  is all of the references to upstate NY.  I understand being proud of where you\'re from.  Or even a ""themed"" restaurant.  But when you have a Char Heel dog  a Maui dog  a Joliet dog and a Sonoran dog  you lose a NY theme possibility.  When you\'re in the heart of Charlotte  a ""Go Panthers"" dog seems more appropriate to pleasing your customer base than a ""Go Bills"" dog.', 'Oh my goodness this place was awesome! I love hot dogs  so when my friends who lived in Charlotte suggested that they take me here  I was thrilled. This was the best hot dog that I have ever had.  The onion rings were out of this world as well.  Another plus was that they have a station with all the jalapenos and pickles that you could ask for! A hot dog  side and drink were right around $10.  It was a gorgeous day when we went and we sat on the adorable rooftop.  It was a great experience! Love this place.', ""NOM NOM NOM! \n\nHow did it take me so long to find my favorite lunch place in Charlotte? I am so sad that I didn't eat here earlier. I love that their menu allows for vegetarian and turkey hot dog substitutions (for a non-red meat/pork eater). Their onion rings and tater tots are delicious and they have a great beer selection.\n\nSure  I may have to add an extra hour of workouts a week  but this place is well worth it!"", 'I have been here twice and never had a bad visit. The food is delicious! The service was just ok  but nothing bad. The atmosphere is inviting. Good prices! I will definitely be coming back.', ""The pickled bar takes JJ's to 5 stars in my book. Love salsa bars? Try a pickled bar! Pickled onions  jalapeños  cucumber (of course)  carrots.\n\nI usually go with the Sonoran  a southwest style dog - beans  salsa  cilantro crema. Good stuff!\n\nI have been meaning to try more of their sides  but I love the onion rings too much. Thin cut style with a crispy  flaky shell. I could eat those all day if I had enough Tums. \n\nMy only wish is that the milkshakes were thicker; mine was a bit thin. \n\nJJ's is now one of my go-to spots; especially when I want to keep it under $10."", '***This review is for Sausage Fest 2014***\nHad a GREAT time!! All you can eat sausage and BEER!! Had Elk  Italian  Oriental(w/shrimp!)   Lamb and Turkey sausage.Tasty sauces/condiments to go with each..All very good  my top 2 favorites were the Oriental and Italian..Also had a pepper jack Brat w/ coleslaw..One of the highlights which did run out was a chowder..WOW!! Could have eaten a gallon of that!! Good bands also..Had awesome beers from NODA   Triple C  Wicked Weed and a few others.  Very friendly staff!!  Good vibes all around.Will go back to the restaurant proper in the future and hope there is a Fest in 2015!!', ""Honestly  the hotdogs were average. I've had a better hot dog at Cookout (restaurant). Maybe next time I'll try the sausage dog instead. I was kind of disappointed with my hot dog & my onion rings weren't fresh. I still believe this is a great spot to try if you like hotdogs. I may have just caught them on a bad day or I didn't order the right kind of hotdog. The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice. They also have outdoor seating if you like the outdoors. I'm going back the next time when I visit Charlotte  NC to try something new & rewrite this review if anything changes."", 'People that love Hot Dogs love this place.  I had their brat dog and it was one of the best I have had in a long time!\nTry It', ""One of the best hot dawgs that I've had in a while. Bread was cotton soft and the chili was great. I had the Char Heel & a Chili Cheese Coney. 2 Thumbs up!!"", ""I love JJ Red Hots! You can't go wrong with anything you order from here. Surprisingly  this place has one of the best salads- add some salmon and BAM! Delicious! \n\nThey also have a great drink special for craft beers in Saturday's so that makes this place even better!"", 'I had heard about this joint on the radio about new successful restaurants so when I was in the area I was excited to try it out. \n\nThe dog of the day was ""Shred  Hot  and Bleu"". Right up my alley!  I asked about the dog size and the nice lass behind the counter said average size.  She was right and I was a little disappointed.  \n\nI figured one dog wasn\'t enough for a lunch  and at $3.99 I wasn\'t going to spend $8 on 2 hot dogs of average size (there was a 2 dog meal but it didn\'t seem like a value) I was certainly ready to be wrong!  I got the onion rings as part of the combo (which was a good deal). \n\nI was quite disappointed with the dog  flavor and bun. There was supposed to be a hot sauce component but I never tasted it (I saw a tiny bit of a reddish sauce). The slaw was good and the Bleu cheese was just the right strength.  The dog itself was small and not hot (temp)  the bun was 2nd rate (maybe a bit too humid? It didn\'t taste fresh). \n\nOnion rings were hot and delicious.  Very light batter.  Little crumbly made it tougher to eat with a nice shirt on but worth the effort. \n\nIf the dogs themselves were better (a lot larger and hot) and they get the balance of toppings right then they may have a $4 hot dog but as it is now  I would pay $2.00-$2.50 for one.\n\nSo I came back about a year later and got a Sonoran w/rings (free rings thanks to Yelp coupon!).  The bun was much better this time  but the rings were greasy.  Dog itself (good beef taste) was really good (& messy!). Pickle bar was cool but no plates to put the stuff on!\n\nVerdict: still overpriced for hot dogs but good for a change of pace.', ""I think I'll have to go back \nThey have lots of different options & fountain Cheerwine.\nStaff was nice & food came quickly.\n\nUPDATE\nI love this place it's my go to lunch stop.\nNot a fan of the mustard but definitely love the Whistle Pig & the dog that has pimento cheese & slaw ( my favorite one so far)\n\nThe Southern Girl dog is the best!!! No mustard so you can taste the pimento:)"", ""Having been to Buffalo  NY many times in college  I loved getting my Red Hot fix.  I cannot explain it  they're just better than regular hot dogs.\n\nSo  while in Charlotte  I figured I had to hit up some Red Hot dogs.  This place did NOT disappoint.  Lots of great combination Red Hots and Sausage options.  \n\nTry everything. We each got something different  and I was impressed with every combo I saw.  Onion rings are great too. \n\nService is friendly.  Place is clean.  I will be back when I'm in Charlotte next time."", ""My friend and I have been very much anticipating a visit to JJ's. Sadly we were very disappointed. The staff was unfamiliar with the menu and it took over 10 minutes just to order. Our food arrived before our beers. I can honestly say I can make a better Chicago style dog at home. The seasoned chips were the best part of the meal and the manager looked like he had just crawled out from under a car in a garage. The only reason we will return would be for beer and chops on the rooftop during the summer."", 'Love coming here  its like going to Teds back in Buffalo and they have the #1 combo which is the same thing i would get in buffalo with everything on the dog with webersmustard.', ""Not a terrible experience  but by no means the best dog I've ever had.\n\nEnded up here on a Sunday afternoon after a whole lot of walking at Freedom Park  mostly due to the convenience of its location. I'm more of a burger guy myself  but I hear good things about JJ's so I was excited to give them a try. \n\nNot particularly busy when we arrived. The only time spent waiting was while we looked through the menu as I believe this was the first time here for all but one of our party. Quite a variety of choices  but I settled on the Chili Cheese Coney (minus the onions) fries and a drink. Staff at the counter seemed to be enjoying themselves and were genuinely polite. It's a fast casual set up here so I grabbed my little number sign and put it on the end of our table. Table itself was clean  but one of our group sitting a little closer to the window said the ledge right next to the table was super dusty. Not great. In the mean time I tried the sweet tea which was rather good. Well brewed adequately sweet tea is a easy way to win points with me. \n\nDidn't have to wait very long for our food  always nice. First thing I tasted were the crinkle cut fries. I assume they're brought in frozen (like a lot of places) but they were definitely a step above what you get at the store. Nice and crispy. Unfortunately the dog itself was actually my least favorite part of the meal. For starters  despite the menu stating all dogs are served on toasted Martins potato buns  mine was definitely not toasted. I wouldn't mind on a regular dog  but when chili is involved a toasted bun adds some needed structural integrity. Speaking of chili  this was the main cause of my disappointment. No spice  very little flavor and upsetting levels of sweetness. The menu states it is made in house  but it reminded me of a bad store bought spaghetti sauce. The wiener itself just tasted like any old hot dog. Maybe it was the chili overpowering it but it didn't step up to the plate in terms of flavor. \n\nI still had a pleasant visit but I attribute a lot of that to the company. I don't really have any plans to return here over other places nearby  but if I ended up in the neighborhood again maybe I'd try one of their house made sausages. Perhaps those have a little more flavor. My personal opinion at the moment is there are simply better place in Charlotte to get a hot dog."", 'I fell through for International Hot Dog Day and had the house special: a beef dog with jalapenos  beans  cheese  bacon and mustard. I sampled the pickled bar  and got over-excited to see a sign that read pickled okra  but the container turned up empty. In JJ\'s defense  it was during lunch rush  and the pickled cauliflower (kind of) made up for it.\nOverall  the meal was just OK. My dog was all bark--it looked good  but I like the kind of sausage that ""snaps back"" when you bite into it. If you can\'t have the casing  though  at least have the burn. The dog was too pale for my taste. My hubby liked the bun  but I found it rather heavy and bland for a potato roll. \nMy side was the borracho beans  which boast a little beer and a sprinkling of shredded cheese. But even with a douse of Tabasco AND Texas Pete  the flavors didn\'t pop. It\'s a nice try  but for gourmet dogs the king is still Miami\'s Dogma  at least in the southeast.\nShout-out to JJ\'s Dog of the Week  the Creative Loafing-inspired dog Fear and Loafing. You can\'t go wrong with bacon  crushed pineapple  Sriracha  no matter what.', ""I will start by saying I will come back to try some other items on their menu but I have an issue with their hotdogs. The style of hotdog was not good quality. When I crave a hotdog  I want a firm dog that's snaps when I bite it. These were soft a pale in color. This place offers something very very far from a Nathan's  Sabrett's  Hebrew National  etc. The biggest sin..THEY DON'T HAVE MUSTARD!!!!!  They do offer some weird bright yellow stuff that may resemble mustard to those who do not know better. If you think French's or Hienz is mustard  I have a bridge I'd like to sell you."", ""So...\n\n... From the get go  let me say that if you follow my reviews and check-ins  you know that I'm pretty partial to a certain hot-dog business at the corner of 4th and Tryon. That's not to say that I'm not open to other places! I was actually looking forward to trying what many people would consider Charlotte's best mass-market dog. I wanted to start by saying I'm first and foremost objective when it comes to business reviews  especially local Charlotte businesses. So what happened?\n\nAfter spending a good 4 hours at Freedom Park  walking nearly 7 miles and burning 1100 calories  we had a party of 6 that was very tired and hungry. JJ's was pretty close and cheap according to Yelp so we decided that it was a great opportunity to diversify our weenie portfolio. Walking in  the restaurant is somewhere between rustic and retro. Honestly the decor would have been just fine if some of the more discerning factors of cleanliness were addressed. Tables seemed like they were wiped frequently  but the drink station was a mess  and immediately we noticed that the ledges above the booths were covered in an even layer of dust. Rocky start already  we were all glad one member of our household that has a chronic dust allergy stayed home.\n\nI got two dogs: The Char-Heel (Chili  slaw  onions  sub Mustard for 'rocket sauce') and the Quarter Hounder (BLT with queso and Secret sauce). Somewhat redundant I also got slaw on the side  which I'm glad I did because it was actually pretty good!\n\nFirst off  the char-heel  this Hot Dog was okay. No one at the table who got Chili was blown away by it. We all agreed the dominant profile was sweet  which was a little strange. The rest of the dog was good but the Chili just didn't do it for me.\n\nThe second dog had just too much going on to be able to describe a profile. The Quarter Hounder  like the char-heel  was an OK dog. Between the queso  the secret sauce  bacon  tomato  etc  it wasn't memorable due to nothing really standing out. On both dogs  I really liked the 'just-right' amount of char  unlike some at the table I can appreciate the flavor it adds.\n\nThe one thing I was really happy about was the pickle bar  oddly enough I usually universally dislike pickles. Something drew me to the hot dills and the picked onions and adding them to both dogs made them much better in my opinion.\n\nSo with all that said  hours after our meal I ended up very sick  stomach issues (not going to get graphic  but pretty bad...). My meals for yesterday were as follows: Small Bowl of cereal at 10am  then JJ's at 6pm. I have what I would consider a very resilient constitution  I can handle spicy/rich/heavy carbs with no issue  but last night something went wrong. Dehydration set in and then it was a rough night.\n\nWhile I respect the reputation that JJ's has made for itself in Charlotte  I don't think I'll be coming back. I struggle to give any place a low-star review and in the moment it wasn't a bad experience. It's just what followed that sealed the deal for me."", 'I LOVE THIS PLACE! \n\nWe go there all the time. Everything on the menu is good. Never a disappointment. I have tried both locations in Charlotte and will continue to go. Great service and great options. Onions rings are amazing.', 'Always fast and good service. Very clean and very nice staff. I ordered the dirty jerz with fries and a drink. Came up to 7.50 a little steep but food is good. Will come back', 'Killer dogs  selection of beer  sides  and all for an incredible price. Service is good  decent parking  inside is nice.', 'Exceptional service and food.

Only drawback would be the somewhat soggy bun bread on one side  but I'm still coming back for more!"", 'Love this place....Slice of home as sahlens are a wny staple.

Kid friendly with a lot to choose from.  I will have to come many more times to enjoy it all.\n\nThey have a ""hall of fame"" menu that is on the table  so check that out before you order. They have a text club and when you join you get a free dog! Also free rings with a yelp check in...wow! \n\nI can\'t wait to return for more.  And make sure you stop @ King of Pops on your way out for a frozen treat.', ""My wife and I just stopped by for lunch on a Monday around lunch time.

It took us less than 30 minutes to order  eat and get back to the car so great spot for a quick bite or a sit down."", ""Great options for a low priced vegetarian meal. The veggie hotdogs are absolutely wonderful. They have a self-serve topping section as well with two different types of house made pickles and some pickled ginger-carrots. Don't miss the Ogre sauce that is stored next to the pickles  it's a great tangy barbeque sauce that tastes great on tots."", 'An epic lunch spot hidden in Dilworth! My boyfriend and I love going when we want a treat. They really have epic food and service. They make all of their sausages in-house and you can taste the difference. A great atmosphere and place to grab a quick bite to eat.', ""The first things I noticed after ordering were that the cup lid dispenser looked dirty  and the area around the drink machine needed a wipe down. The metal number that they gave me to take to the table had ketchup on it. And the ledge along all benches and windows was just coated in dust. Further down I could see cobwebs. Not really starting off great there. \n\nThe Coney Dog didn't really wow me. It was just okay. One note really. The chili was too sweet and onions on it were placed on top in the very center. If onions are on a hot dog  they should be sprinkled all the way across it so they can be enjoyed with every bite. Instead  half of the meager pile of onions toppled off when I picked the dog up because they didn't have anything to hold them there. \n\nThe #1 claims that it has spicy relish. Which it just wasn't. I'd call it mildly spicy as the regular old yellow mustard had more bite to it. Grab the Tabasco  by the forks and spoons  you'll need some if you want some heat. The pickle wedge inside the bun is just a bad idea. The dog just bullies it out as you're eating. You could try to hold it in like I did  but you'll get coated on mustard and relish. The relish also brings a pickle taste to the dog  so let the pickle escape and eat it at the end. Aside from the pickle  the rest of the toppings were evenly enough distributed  though the bun was rather wet. This dog is definitely more acidic than hot. \n\nAfter eating here  I just don't get the hype with this place."", ""I have traveled around  and lived in quite a few different places but I can say without reservation that JJ's serves the BEST dogs I have ever eaten. I know that is a pretty strong statement  but JJ's takes the simple concept of a hot dog and makes it something much better. The dogs themselves are TOP quality  the buns are TOP quality. Then the dogs are chargrilled  and the buns are toasted on a grill. That is hard to top by itself  but they offer topping combinations that take an AWESOME dog  and knock your taste buds out of the park.  Am I raving about hot dogs ? Absolutely ! Try them for yourself  and you'll be a believer."", ""This is a very good hot dog place. There are many variations on the basic hot dog. They also feature bratwurst and andouille sausage items as well. Their slaw is excellent too. Our table tried 5 different combinations and we enjoyed all of them. Caution!  Eating these hot dogs can be extremely messy.  The proportions are generous. We also enjoyed the hand cut fries and onion rings. \nJJ's also features local craft beers too. This is a great place to hang out with a bunch of friends. It is a very roomy restaurant"", 'I got a Char heel which is the southern staple of chilli  mustard onions and slaw.\nIt was very refreshing to see an actual real grill top charing up the dogs....nothing better than a grilled dog...hate boiled ones. \nActual weiner tasted great but the toppers needed more punch to them...all on the bland side. You do have the option to create your own dog or try one of their many variations   but I love the Carolina dog and was a little let down. \nMy best dog in the Charlotte area search continues...but the deli beside Amelies French bakery on Davidson is still in the lead.', ""My hot dog is always so good when I get one here! It's always perfectly grilled so it has that snap when you bite into it and then middle is just delicious and juicy and pink. I really like the potato buns  and I always get a side of french fries  and they're always so good! I want to try the onion rings  but maybe next time! I really love the atmosphere  the people are always nice and helpful  and if it's a great warm day sit upstairs  outside!"", ""So my friends told me that this place had veggies dogs  with me being on a vegan diet  I was a little skeptical.

The answer is yes: on your next trip to Ravi's.\n\nThe only downside is that it's not free.  In addition to not being free  it's not super cheap  either.

I could eat this by the gallon!!', 'I\'ve only been here once but definitely plan to come back!\n\nI came here with my running group and there eight of us who ran 14k with this place as the final destination on a Saturday morning.\n\nThe prices are on par with soup prices at ""fancy"" restaurants but you get a good deal if you go for the combo with a wrap (although the soup portion is a bit less in a combo).\n\nThe soup variety are not the typical ones you find in a can at your local grocery chain so you\'ll definitely fulfil any culinary desire to try something that\'s not ""run of the mill"".  \n\nI also enjoyed the presentation of the food where you are provided with a personal Lazy Susan to help you navigate your meal.  Definitely a nice touch!\n\nAfter the feedback and word of mouth  the eight of us plan to run back here but it sounds like our running group will double!', ""I'm in love with Ravi stew. Chock full of veggies and chicken and great flavor. Not from Toronto but I now go here whenever I'm in town for the stew. The flaky cheesy biscuit you get with the stew is like icing on a perfect cake.

Who does that anymore?!). Good people with great food."", 'After wanting to try Ravi soups out for months it did not disappoint. The curried lentil and apricot soup was the clear winner of everything we tried. We also tried the veggie wrap  pork wrap  and corn bisque.', ""I like it. They've got wraps  and they've got soups. Order them both as a combo and you save several couple dollars (though the soup is a bit smaller than the stand-alone offering).\n\nWrap is flavorful  soups are hearty. The lamb wraps and chicken wraps were satisfying; not too small  but not too big.\n\nThe Ravi Stew is just stuffed full of vegetables and chicken; very nice.\nChicken hot pot soup was also really good."", ""To be perfectly honest  I've only had the mushroom soup. Mostly because it is the most delicious soup I have ever eaten. It's so rich and 'meaty' (with no meat-meat  just 'shroom meat) that I just can't help but order it everytime I go there.\n\nIt has been a while but the last few times I went  my soup came with a home made biscuit (aweeeeesome) with some sort of home made red pepper jelly (awesomely delicious).\n\nThere are now two convenient locations - one at Adelaide and John and another at Queen and Dovercourt. yumyumyum!\n\nGO HERE. You will be drifted away to soupy goodness..."", ""I've been to Ravi Soups multiple times. My go-to is the wrap & soup combo  with the Ravi stew and the Curried Lamb wrap. These are the most expensive options on the menu  but worth the extra couple of dollars. The flank steak wrap is also pretty flavourful.  Portions were sizeable  and soups came out hot.\n\nHaving tried pretty much anything on the menu  my least favourites were the Porcini Mushroom Wild Rice and the Roasted Pork Shoulder wrap  both of which were just pretty bland compared to the other options.\n\nYou can eat there and be served on a lazy susan  or get it to go. They are relatively quick  so a great place for the quick bite."", ""Butternut squash soup. Whatever you are picturing in your mind  it's better. I actually dreamt about it last week. The chicken wrap  soup and scone is one of the meals I would orders for a last meal before my execution.  It's always busy but not too busy that you want to walk out.  Take out or eat in - Equally as good."", ""3.5/5  +.5 for service\n\nI finally got a chance to try Ravi Soups after hearing it for so long!\n\nA sign parked outside the restaurant mentioned that Beef Miso Soup was one of their specialties. I love miso soup  but I've never tried it with beef before  so I figure I'd give it a shot.\n\nThere's not much decoration in this place  although they have a nice patio at the rear. In here  you order beforehand and then find a table to sit  and either someone will deliver the food to you or they will call your number and you pick it up.\n\nI ordered the Beef Miso Soup. While the price was a little steep at $9.99  the soup did come with a biscuit  and the portions were quite large. The first thing I noticed was that there was a very heavy spice taste upon sip after sip  so if spice is something you can't take I'd suggest ordering another soup. The ingredients were overall good for the amount I paid  and I especially loved the baby spinach that was added to the soup. As for the biscuit  it was a good addition with the soup  but not something that I felt spectacular over.\n\nService was excellent  and if you're a first time visitor the cashier will help you with your order. Not bad I must say!"", ""Delicious!  Fast  inexpensive and just fantastic.  I got the soup and wrap combo:  Porcini Mushroom wild rice bisque and the roasted chicken wrap.  I had to be back at work and only had 30 minutes and didn't know what this place was like but they were literally 5 minutes to have my order ready and everything was perfect.  Had a nice sit in the back patio  enjoyed my meal and still made it to work on time.  I didn't realize how amazing this place was to Yelpers prior to coming.  I was originally looking for a pita and on the way to the Pita Pit  I saw this place.\nThe wrap was just fantastic!  The chutney inside was amazing and there was something in the mayo that was also delicious.  I feel like they could have added a bit of spice to it (the chutney was a super mild) but size was good and overall I was happy.  The soup was a tad saltier than I would have liked and just on top of the soup I could see a little bit of grease bubbles.  BUT  it was yummy none the less.  Main reason I only gave a 4/5 was because I was hoping that with the word Soup in the places name  I expected this to be the all star of the food I bought.  The salty part of the soup for me wasn't even that big of an issue but the grease in the soup..... After I ate the soup I could rub my lips together and they would slide.  Yes  it was that greasy.  Great taste but in my opinion  they need to back off the oil a bit.\nI will still be back here but next time I want to try the Ravistew."", ""3/5\nSo I finally made a trip to Ravi Soup. After all the good reviews and my friend's recommendation  I was very excited about this place. \n\n I ordered soup and wrap combo: curry lamb wrap & corn crab chowder which was around $12-3 include tax. What a great deal?! However when I got my food I was bit disappointed. Corn chowder was decent but nothing special. It was creamy chowder with bits of corns and light touch of crab meat. When I heard about corn chowder  I was expecting deep corn flavor and a nice touch of crab meat.  There was barely no corn flavour or actual corn in the soup. To be fare  soup itself was still better than a lot of other awful places  but it definitely didn't meet my expectation. Same for the wrap  but at least wrap delivered what it promised to deliver. It was a nice fresh wrap packed with lamb meat and a light curry kick.  It has a bit of typical stench of lamb meat but curry covered it nicely. Also after a light kick of curry  sweet potato smoothen the pallette. It was a good balance but still not extraordinary. I personally enjoy more defined and characteristic dishes. if you enjoy not over seasoned dishes  you will definitely enjoy Ravi Soup. \n\nThe restaurant is more of a loud and busy. It's more of hit and run kind of place then an actually restaurant or a quite cafe. There are few small tables and a huge table at the back. It will be a good place to grab something during lunch hour at work. They also have a patio at the back. It was too cold for me to go check out but seems pretty nice. \n\nOverall  Ravi Soup was a nice place to grab something light and warm food if I'm around the neighborhood. At this point  it's not worth a making trip but just in case if it's a bad day thing  I will have to make one or two more visit to make a right decision."", ""So good I ended up devouring most of it before I could take some solid photos. \n\nDid the wrap combo with garden veggie wrap and apricot and red lentil soup. Wrap wasn't as big as I would have liked but was of very high quality. Soup was similarly awesome. On the spicy side. Both items had tons of Indian flavour to it. So if you like those spices and flavours  this will be right up your alley. \n\nHighly recommend. Had this in the summer. Must be even better during the winter."", ""Ravi Soups is one of my favourite places to eat in Toronto. You get a very high quality meal for under $15. Their food is all full of amazing flavours and incredible value considering the quality of the ingredients.\n\nI have tried pretty much everything on the menu but my favourite soup/wrap combo is the Curried Apricot & Lentil Soup with the Curried Lamb wrap. It doesn't get better than that! If you love mushroom soup definitely try their Porcini Mushroom soup.\n\nA soup/wrap combo is the best value and will cost $10.99 plus tax. They offer takeout  or you can eat there. The patio is really nice in the summer months!\n\nHere is my blog review on them if you are interested: http://www.cheapdude.com/food/ravi-soups/"", ""I've been here multiple times. The food is amazing. I get the grilled veggie wrap and a soup. Every soup I've had is delicious.    I've never been disappointed.  The service is great.  They are quick and friendly.  And it's a good deal too. Less than $20 to fill your belly and maybe even take some home for later.  I give 5 out of 5."", ""I love RaviSoups. I always heard great things about this place and a few years back I stopped in and had the best wrap and soup on a cold winter day. I'm rarely in this area  but I always want to stop in when I am. I needed a quick dinner one night before the Jays game so I popped in here and ordered a wrap. Also a plus that they had beer! I also ordered via Foodora for their wrap and soup combos. They look small but once you actually eat the entire meal it's enough. Some of the items I've tried and recommend: steak or chicken wrap. As for soups  I like the corn chowder (has crab)  butternut squash or ravi stew!"", 'Came here for the first time last week even though I go by it count less times. Wife and I got a soup + wrap combo and another solo soup to share. I\'ll keep this review short since it\'s not about the food  it\'s about the experience. The quality of the food was okay but sitting in the back with bathroom tiled decor eating our $30 meal did not feel worthy of the price. It didn\'t feel ""clean"" as another reviewer said and the bright lights just showcase every imperfection of the place.\n\nMy review is also slightly biased because I\'m generally never craving soup. Not that I don\'t love a good soup but there is never a day where I say to myself  ""I really need a soup right now."" It\'s generally...""I need a poutine or I need some Asian food."" Soup...not really. So perhaps that is why I felt as though the price (min $10) for the soups are a little high. I also like paying for ""effort"" and when someone makes soup in bulk  pouring it into a bowl for me doesn\'t seem like much ""effort"". \n\nNow if you are a soup lover then this might be the place for you.\n\n3 stars for an average experience due to the decor and the high cost of the simple meal.', ""Delicious soups and wraps.

I'll change my review to 5 stars when I go back and get a good soup."", 'The food at Ravi Soups makes for a quick and moderately priced lunch.  As the name suggests  their menu includes a selection of soups.  Both tasty and unique  each soup is very good indeed.  The portions are a little small however  and it is somewhat on the expensive side.  The quality and freshness of the ingredients is apparent  and certainly justifies the price tag.  \n\nIt is their wraps however that really make the place worth visiting.  The lamb wrap  is exceptional.  Without doubt some of the best curried lamb I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy.  The addition of pineapple really helps balance out the flavor. \n\nAll in  this provides a great place for lunch or dinner  the price point is a little high though.', ""My boyfriend and I went here for a late lunch  as I was craving something delicious and warm on a rather chilly day.

So many good flavours and lots of juicy lamb.\n\nGrilled Steak Wrap - Also delicious. The cheese was yummy and so was the sauce.\n\nButternut Squash Soup - Possibly best squash soup I've ever had  and I have had many.

The italian sausage wrap was fairly lackluster  the meat tasted like the stuff you purchase from supermarkets.\n\nValue: 6/10\n\nWe got the soup and wrap combo for $14 (wrap + half a bowl of soup).

As a great spot for take-out or dine-in  Ravi always seems to be the place to indulge for most of us in the Fashion and Entertainment districts.\n\nRavi gets his inspiration from native Sri Lanka. As previous  saucier and known ""soup master"" of Mildred Pierce  he decided to open up his own kitchen and enchant us with his creative and delicious soups and wraps. Inspired by exotic ingredients from beautiful Sri Lanka and other parts of Asia  Ravi has been able to wow the crowds of 9-5ers looking for a different and tasty lunch fix.\n\nAlthough all of the featured wraps at RaviSoups are amazing  my absolute favourite is the Curried Lamb wrap.\n\nThis wrap has the most delicious and creative ingredients one can never find in any other wrap  anywhere! This unique flour creation comes with lamb  roasted yams (a.k.a sweet potatoes)  baby spinach  mango pineapple salsa  edamame  lime chili and mint cilantro. That\'s Ravi\'s secret  innovation and creativity with flavour in mind!\n\nThat said  Ravi\'s famed reviews come from his hearty and yummy soups; hence the name RaviSoups.  The soups are something extraordinary and tasty. For those that are soup-averse  you will need to try Ravi before you say ""pass"". \n\nMy choice for lunch usually starts with the Curried Apricot and Red Lentil Soup. A must have.\n\nThough my belief is that Ravi does not disclose the full length of the spices and ingredients of the soups  he does provide a sneak peek at what seems to be the best possible combination for a hearty soup - red lentils  curry flavoured apricot (my guess is this is blended in the curry)  cilantro and lime creme fraiche. And that\'s just a preview  your palette will be able to tell you more once you try it  trust me!\n\nSince RaviSoups is still working on their website  I have not been able to include a link to it.

Can\'t stop coming here for lunch whenever I didn\'t bring lunch to work  so much so that my husband goes ""I\'ve noticed this Ravi Soup place on the credit card bill a lot lately...""\n\nI\'ve had the beef wrap  the chicken wrap  and the chicken stew. Like others have said  the soup and wrap combo is huge portions - I usually save half for dinner. Similarly for the chicken stew  every time I go I\'ve had to ask for a take-out container. How they can make the soup/broth so delicious is beyond me. I really don\'t think I\'m able to recreate the flavours at home... Definitely try this if you\'ve never  especially now that the weather is getting cold!', ""Best soup and sandwich combo you're going to find anywhere! Seating can be a little challenging  depending on when you arrive  but to me that's part of the intrigue of the restaurant as there is one giant table in the back that a majority of the people sit around. That being said  highly recommend!"", 'Where do I began... these guys have taken the soup and sandwich combo and spiced it up to the next level! I typically never liked soup and sandwich because it is more like a cafeteria food but with these indian/middle eastern type flavours and ingredients you cannot go wrong. And shall I add that is extremely healthy and conducive to any clean eating diet. LOVE LOVE this place and be back at least once a week..\n\nThanks for doing this guys. Keep it up!', ""As a lover of soups  I honestly really wanted to like this place  but unfortunately it just wasn't very good.\n\nI'm usually very indiscriminate with my soups. Soup is my go to appetizer  and I almost always enjoy my order of soup  even if the soup itself isn't the best. I was really looking forward to the soup here  but I ended up disappointed with what I got at Ravi Soups.\n\nI ordered a leek and artichoke soup  and what I got was closer to coconut milk with a sprinkle of leeks. The soup tasted extremely under seasoned to me (if it was seasoned at all)  and I have a light palate. It was also lacking in flavour. There was a hint of leek maybe  but all I got was warm coconut milk. I think the most blasphemous fact of all was that the soup wasn't served piping hot  but rather slightly warmer than lukewarm.\n\nThe sandwich I got was pretty good though  but this place isn't called Ravi Sandwiches."", ""My go-to place if I want a nice bowl of soup. I don't believe in soups but this place brings soups to a different level. Great quality  affordable price ! I don't see it as an ordinary fast food place. I live nearby so it is my regular lunch place."", ""So I was intrigued by the name. A place that focuses on soup? Normally a restaurant has a soup section on the menu  but not a soup menu.\n\nI went here for dinner and loved how simple their menu was. Less than 15 total items and a few daily specials. The focus is soups and wraps. You can also get a combination for ~$10. \n\nRavi's soup was outstanding  the ingredients were fresh  and the flavors were deep and rich. Ravi (who wasn't in when I dined) made the receipe's and has earned my respect! A balance of flavors that were outstanding!  I also got the chicken wrap and loved  again  all fresh ingredients  and a decent portion size. \n\nI strongly recommend you check the place out AT LEAST once  get a combo and enjoy the daily specials! They have vegetarian options if you need them! You'll love the full flavor and won't feel guilty or like you've overeaten. \n\nhave fun!"", ""I came here for lunch one day. This place is easy to miss as there isn't a big sign or noticeable location. It gets overshadowed by the hipster place next door. I came in and wanted to try the soup and wrap combo which was nicely priced. The drink selection isn't great though  and the freezer wasn't exactly cold. Once I ordered  I sat down to get a view of the outside  nothing too special  but it was a gorgeous day out. The soup and wrap was brought out to me and the presentation of it all was beautiful. The service was fast and really really nice. The food tasted fantastic  and it really speaks to the kind of diversity you will find in Toronto as far as food is concerned. I've included a picture of my meal for reference."", ""This place is minutes from my work and I really enjoy the food here.  I usually get the Curried Lamb wrap with the Porchini Mushroom soup combo.  I have tried other items such as Corn Chowder  Chicken wrap  Pulled pork wrap  Beef Miso  and Ravi Stew and they are all very enjoyable.\n\nSo why only the 3 stars you may be asking.  Because it's damn expensive!  I know why others have rated this so high though as most of the people the go there are wealthy suits.  But for a small wrap (about 5 inches) and small soup (about a cup and half) it's $13-15!  If you want their full size wraps and soups it's $7.99-9.99 each.  Others may not know this but soup is not expensive!  It's suppose to be peasant food ffs.\n\nI still come here because it's one of the few healthy options in the area.  So sad :("", ""Quite excellent. A bit pricey but worth it for the amazing flavour combos and filling portions.

Just to sweet because of the sweet potato. Not too bad though."", ""Been here on several occasions and I always go for the soup and wrap combo. \n\nThe curried lamb wrap is my usual  packed full of flavor and lamb isn't dry at all.  The pork shoulder isn't bad either  there is pineapple in this one which adds a nice contrast but the pork does get dry in some places.  \n\nThe soup is what I really come here for. The blue crab and corn chowder soup is by far the favorite here.  There isn't much blue crab but the flavors are right.\n\nOne of my go to comfort places for when I need warm soup and quick bite to eat."", ""This place was very convenient  located right behind the hotel I stayed at (Hyatt Regency).

I haven't even made it to the steak wrap the other customers rave about. The decor and staff are casual and not intimidating  and the food is fantastic."", ""The place serves up wraps and soups that are unique and original. It's a compact menu and the food is pretty much as good as it gets as far as food goes - reasonably priced  tasty  simple  fresh  and healthful. This is probably my favourite place to eat in Toronto right now.\n\nApart from the food  the seating space is simple and uncluttered - some stools at the front facing out to the street; a massive beautiful hardwood dining table in the back (not sure how they got that in there) and an outdoor space in the back - nothing eyecatching (apart from the aforementioned table) but not ugly either.\n\nWhy not 5 stars? The washroom is a bit knackered and down a dodgy steep flight of stairs; it's a bit tight and crowded (and steamy) during their rush hour as they're pretty small.\n\nAll in all  definitely a nice little gem."", ""What to try?!\n\nTheir awesome soup and wrap selection. Initially I thought it was Indian soups  but I soon realize their soups are from Sri Lanka after I read up on the origin of the restaurant afterwards. Started by a guy named Ravi  he slowly but surely made a name for himself in this arena. \n\nWe tried the curry apricot and lentil soup and the beef miso soup. Because we ordered the soup and wrap special  we get half of each full order. The wraps we got were roasted pork shoulder and free range chicken. I thought the soups were very flavourful and rich. Enough for a full meal if you're having with the wrap or if you want a quick snack  the soup will do. The wraps were huge in my opinion! I honestly think the soup and wrap special is enough to feed two ppl comfortably. They make it right on the spot and they heat the wrap up on the pan to seal the wrap. \n\nIt's interesting how they serve their soups and wraps on a lazy Susan or a turntable. Maybe there's a special meaning to the way the food is served. But i thought it moved too much when I tried to scoop the soup. I didn't like the lazy Susan too much so I took my food off the lazy Susan altogether! Perhaps serving it on a serving tray made more sense and it's less weight to carry around all the time...let alone  takes up less space in the kitchen!\n\nLast tip?\n\nIf it's not too cold  dine in the patio out in the back of the restaurant. The patio has a very colourful backdrop and the patio is tucked away between buildings so you get a sense of privacy and peace in such a busy downtown neighbourhood!"", 'Good chicken wrap and corn chowder soup! Always hits the spot. Also the table is pretty dope also', ""Went here for a quick meal after a tiring day of travel. I had the Ravi stew. It was one of the best soups I've ever had.

Mmm delicious! It is so perfectly warming on this somewhat chilly winter day in Toronto  though I actually find the Ravi Stew to be a little bit spicier (and I mean that in a good way!). My friend swears by the veggie wrap  so that's up next on my list of things to try. It has brie in it. BRIE! I can't believe I haven't tried it yet. \n\nThis location is always super busy at lunch time  but service is surprisingly friendly and fast. They have the tiniest little kitchen and yet somehow they're able to handle large quantities of orders quickly and accurately. They have a proven system. Although there's room to sit  I usually get my order to go so I can't comment on the seating or even apparently the little patio that's hidden in the back--but come summer  I will certainly be checking that out. You can count on that!\n\nIt's not cheap  but prices are standard for the area and for the amount of food you get--and the satisfaction it brings--it's worth it.

I ordered the soup and wrap combo - the corn chowder and the pork shoulder wrap. I have to say the prices on their menu is average pricing for places like this. The food was fresh.  The flavors were delicious. I would say this place is great for lunch and a light quick dinner too. I think my favourite was the soup. The soup was really delicious and it had the right amount of spice in it to make it flavorful but not overly spicy. I would definitely come back to this place and would recommend others to come try too. I think next time I am going to try their stew.', 'Yum.

The feel of the restaurant is lunch room-ish  but the food is made of excellent high-class feeling recipes.

We ordered our food at the front and a friendly server brought it to our table within 5 minutes. The portions were large  hot  and filling. My lamb wrap was delicious! The meat was tender and I really enjoyed the combination of the spiced lamb and the sweetness of the mango-pineapple salsa. Unfortunately for my friend  the miso beef soup he ordered turned out to be spicy. This is a person whose favorite 'spice' is salt  so he had a hard time with this soup.

Yes please! But note that Ravi Soups is very popular and is packed at lunch time. My suggestion is to call your order in and pick it up.

There are large tables in the restaurant  but good luck finding a spot.\n\nOn to the food  shall we? I've been here twice now. The first time  I had the chicken broth. Not bad  but nothing special. If you order the soup only  it comes with some bread. On my second visit  I ordered the soup and wrap combo for $10.99. I find this to be a better deal  but the soup size is obviously smaller. I ordered the corn chowder  which contains pieces of blue crab. Yum! Blue crab happens to be one of my favorites. I also ordered the chicken wrap. Delicious."", ""Mmm...love me some Ravi Soups. This place was absolutely divine!! :)\n\nOver the holidays  Husband and I made another trek across the border to Toronto to expand our culinary adventures in this great cosmopolitan city. Ravi Soups was on my to try list for ages  and this trip  we were finally able to make it.\n\nFrom the exterior  the place is a bit hidden  but mostly because the signage is hand written in a script fashion. I love the rustic and hand written style  but if you're not careful  you can easily miss this place. However  if you miss it  just round the corner at John St. and you can loop over. Whatever you do  don't give up on trying this place!\n\nOnce we found parking  we scrambled inside to quickly seek some warmth. After perusing the menu offerings  we decided to split their curried lamb wrap ($8.99) and their corn chowder ($8.99). FYI  you place your order and pay  and then grab a seat.\n\nThe seating arrangement is a bit funky with a long communal table running a good length of the place made out of carved wood  with a 4-5 side tables and a small bar off the entrance. Husband and I love sitting at communal tables  so this was definitely a nice touch to our eating experience. There were already 7 people sitting at the communal table by the time we arrived  and they all seemed to have ordered the soup and wrap combo. Priced at $10.99  i think this is a great deal if you're looking for a smaller portion of their wraps and soups.\n\nHowever  since Husband and I were hungry  we went with the regular portion which was filling  earthy  and extremely flavorful. The lamb wrap had such a fragrant taste with the cumin seeds and the yams incorporated throughout. The subtle bitter undertones of the baby spinach amplified the curry taste in the lamb. Not only was the lamb moist and tender  but it was just the right temperature (not too hot and not warm either - heaven in my mouth!). A great mint chutney with mango pineapple salsa topped off each bite.\n\nNow the corn chowder was another story. :) The sweet flavor of the corn really balanced out the woodsy flavor of the lamb wrap. Topped with some shredded crab meat and thai basil  I had never experienced a wonderful corn chowder like this. What was awesome about it also was that some of the corn kernels were left whole in the pureed soup. The small bits throughout was really nicely thought out. Crab meat wasn't just topped but it was mixed in throughout and they were generous in the amount placed in the soup without being unbalanced.\n\nSince it was cold outside (~20F)  this place really hit the spot. Fresh ingredients  good portions  great value  relatively quick service  and friendly service  Ravi Soups is a must visit if you are into Indian-Southeast Asian inspired wraps and soups in the Toronto Downtown Core. \n\nGreat for vegetarians  carnivores  omnivores  kids  adults! We will certainly be back!"", 'I live near the Queen St location and just discovered the location downtown. Same amazing recipes with a nicer interior and faster service.

I don't usually like sitting at community tables so maybe thats why I didn't like it. The whole restaurant felt a bit dingy though that could just have been the weather. \nI got the porcini mushroom soup and roasted pork shoulder wrap. The wrap was excellent and I highly reccomend it. The herbs and the sauce go really well with the meat. However I was a little dissapointed with my soup. It felt a bit too salty and harsh. My friend got curried apricot soup instead which tasted much much better. Reading over the menu again I think I should have gotten the chicken hot pot instead. Maybe next time. One thing I didn;t like is the fact that the soup was served on one of those lazy susan rotating trays which made it a bit wierd to eat. Overall a really good restaurant.

My free-range chicken wrap was ''nice''  but definitely not anything to rave about. Certainly not considering I paid over $10 just for a wrap.\n\nThe size was very generous (more of a burrito than a wrap!)  the accompanying ingredients were fun and creative (yams!) and the chicken was of great quality  yet still the wrap seemed to lack flavour. There was no 'wow' factor for me that justified the price and the hype (and my long walk....grrr....)\n\nThere was a huge amount of chicken in the wrap  which some would appreciate  but for me the over abundance of meat overshadowed the other ingredients and the sauce and made me feel as though I was eating a lightly seasoned  almost plain chicken wrap. \n\nAgain  fine  and very nice  but just not standout enough for the price and all the super-positive reviews. \n\nAnd allow me to be old-fashioned for a sec - the radio was excessively loud!"", 'I had the curried lamb wrap and soup special Ravi stew and blue crab corn soup I for 11 bucks very good deal.

It's no-frills and hard to miss from the outside if you're not paying attention  but seek it out! \n\nRavi has a good selection of soups and wraps  but my go-to is the Ravi Stew. A hearty tomato-based broth full of shredded chicken  sweet potato  veggies and topped with fried shallots and edamame  it's a huge  healthy bowl of goodness for $10.  Plus  it comes with one of their to DIE for cheddar biscuits - rich  flaky and perfectly matched to the spicy mango chutney served on the side. Everything here is on the spicy side  but it never overpowers the flavors.\n\nIn my opinion  Ravi represents the best that Toronto has to offer:  tiny hole-in-the-wall  mom-and-pop restaurants winning acclaim for good  healthy  home-cooked food.

I read many reviews  and Ravi Soups consistently received rave reviews from diners. So I got three friends together and we visited the Adelaide location (they also have locations on Queen Street West and Charles and Yonge). The space was rustic with plenty of seating indoors  and they also had a patio. My friends and I found seats and we eat took turns going to the front to order. The three of us decided to get a combo (soup and wrap). I had spent a lot of time reading through the menu  and recommendations from other diners  and decided to go with the very popular Corn Chowder made with blue crab  thai basil and crispy shallots.\n\nThe food looked great  and my expectations were high  but I found the highlight of my meal to be the cheddar cheese biscuit and red pepper jelly that you get on the side with a soup order.

Only cheese biscuit not so healthy.', ""I'm writing this review after my second visit to Ravi Soup.  I went for a quick dinner on a Wednesday evening.  My previous visit was a couple of years ago during lunch on a weekday.  I remember the place being busy  but the service was prompt (although the food took a while)  and the food was delicious.  \n\nFast forward to tonight.  Dinner time around Ravi must be a dead zone because it's night and day versus lunch time.  We walked in and there was nobody except two girls just finishing up their dinners and leaving.  Otherwise  it was completely empty.  After poking around a while  someone finally comes up from the basement to take our order.  Weird.\n\nThe place being empty gave us a chance to at least get a better look at the place.  It's not a sparking gem  but it's functional with a larger seating area at the back.  There's a counter at the front with stools.  In warmer weather  they open up the window in this area so that counter sitters can enjoy a nice breeze with their meal.  However  the counter itself wasn't exactly clean (not filthy  just not clean) and the stools were uncomfortable.\n\nI ordered the pork shoulder wrap  and my companion had the organic chicken wrap.  We didn't co-ordinate and both ended up getting the mushroom soup.  I don't remember what I had a couple of years ago  but the lasting impression was that the food was delicious.  That hasn't changed.  My wrap was moist  delicious with a lot of flavours going on.  Definitely not a Mega Wraps style wrap.  The chicken wrap was also proclaimed to be fresh and tasty.  However  we both agreed that although the mushroom soup was very flavourful and deep  it was much too salty.  I wish we had gotten different soups so I could see if this is a problem for only the mushroom soup  or all soups.\n\nI was a bit torn between 3 or 4 stars  but after mulling it over  I think 3 stars is more appropriate.  Yes  the food is delicious  but overseasoning is a sin of cooking.  And as at it's heart  Ravi is a soup and sandwich place  I don't necessarily care that their decor is virtually non-existent  but cleanliness and comfortable seating should be a basic even here.  It's too bad.  I really did want to rate this place higher."", ""Delicious wraps and sandwich combos! Amazingly fresh taste. They've got their sauces down. The texture of the wrap is thin but crispy. \n\nCurried lamb is my favourite wrap  chicken is average (good quality chicken but too much yam)  the pork shoulder is very filling and a bit dry but that can be fixed with their delicious sauce as a side on the plate.\n\nThe mushroom soup is my favourite. Clam chowder with crab was very good too  you can really taste the cran. Ravi stew is alright  it's on the spicy side. \n\nThere is a backyard patio which is nice during the warmer months. It's a little dead during dinner time but the quality of food is just as great.\n\nI wish they would keep updating or change up their menus!"", ""Came here with friends after catching a movie and you can't go wrong at Ravi Soups.

If you only get their soups  they range from $7.99 to $8.99 which is a bit pricey. They also offer a soup combo which comes with a wrap and a bowl of soup for $10.99. I believe the portion of the soup that comes with the combo is smaller than a regular order of soup. \n\nI ordered the curried lamb wrap - with roasted yams  baby spinach  mango pineapple salsa  lime chili and mint cilantro. I was surprised to see that they made the wraps fresh to order. It certainly isn't fast food since after assembling them  they heated them up on the flat top.  It was a decent sized wrap  filled with a generous portion of lamb. I liked that they wrapped the filling inside the baby spinach so the tortilla didn't get all soggy. The flavour of the wrap was amazing. The curry was really flavourful and the meat was tender. All the ingredients just went really well together.  I highly recommend this!\n\nI also ordered the corn chowder - with blue crab  thai basil and crispy shallots. The wrap and the soup came served on our own personal lazy susan's  which was something definitely different! The crab in the soup was nice and the crispy shallots were a great garnish to the dish. The soup itself was great  but I actually found my wrap to be better than the soup.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the roasted free range chicken wrap - with roasted yams  baby spinach  caramelized onions  tomato chutney  chipotle mayo. This wrap was another winner. The combination of all the ingredients worked really well and the chicken was nice and moist. \n\nHe also ordered the Porcini mushroom wild rice bisque - with crispy shallots and truffle oil to go with his combo. This soup was out of this world. It had a strong mushroom flavour and was simply delicious. Definitely order this if you're a fan of mushrooms!\n\nAlthough the place itself is one of those hole-in-a-wall type restaurants  the food itself makes up for the lack of décor and atmosphere."", ""Really enjoyed my meal here tonight. Came here on a friends suggestion to try some place new. I called ahead not sure if I needed to make reservations due to all of the positive reviews on yelp. Got there and it wasn't busy. Ordered the soup and wrap combo  lamb wrap and butternut squash soup. The lamb wrap was pretty awesome  it had curry base so it helped knock out some of my under the weather I was feeling. The soup was delicious  it was hot and complimented the wrap perfectly. Will definitely return for the same thing again!"", ""Contrary to the name  I'd recommend this place for the wraps much more than the soups. The veggie/mediterranean wrap is a great vegetarian option too."", 'Great wraps  great soups and all with a really nice price specially if you do a combo', 'Probably my favouite lunch spot in the financial district.  Butternut squash soup with caramelized onions and pear along side the curry lamb wrap with mango and pinapple.

Most importantly very tasty :))', 'Went to Ravi because of the rave reviews on Yelp -- very disappointed!\n\nI ordered the chicken stew and my boyfriend had the soup and wrap combo (mushroom bisque and the steak wrap).\n\nThe soup was delicious for the first few spoonfuls  but after a while  both of us found the soups to be overly salty and overly peppery! Both soups tasted like we were devouring pepper soup. \n\nThe only high note was the cheddar biscuit  which was particularly tasty.', ""I love soup.  I coule eat soup every day.  The soups and wraps at Ravi's establishment are veryflavourful and satisfying.  I tried a curried apricot and lentil soup with a lime cream drizzle and I sampled the butternut squash soup.  Both were awesome.  I look forward to going back to this place for lunch.  Some vegetarian options and a banana bread that I have yet to try.\nI went to the Queen Street West location (they also have a location at Adelaide/Peter).  Plenty of space to sit here  I like the counter space myself."", 'Ravi Soups is really A-OK -- if you are in downtown and want a fresh  quick  unique meal  you won\'t go wrong with a wrap & soup combo from Ravi.\n\nHowever... it\'s not all 5-star. The front entry & order counter area is definitely a bit grotty. It doesn\'t scream ""clean and fresh"" like I expected. Nonetheless  the staff are very attentive  friendly  and nice. You\'ll be happy with how you are treated  and get your food promptly -- who doesn\'t like that?\n\nFor the food? Had the lamb curry wrap and the apricot & lentil soup. \n\nThe wrap was very good  but wow  the spice was hotter than I would have expected. I\'m never one to shy away from spicy food. However  I do think that in this case  some of the more subtle flavoring gets lost in the spice  and that\'s a shame  because baby spinach  edamame  and more lurking in that wrap...\n\nThe soup -- similar issues. But in this case  it was that the soup was SO HOT. I got take out  walked the soup 2 blocks back to my hotel  set the soup on the desk for 15+ minutes  and it was STILL too hot! Must have been put in a nuclear reactor back at the shop... Once it cooled down  the flavors were wonderful. Portion (as I almost always think with soup) is silly big. I would have been OK with 1/3 of that little tureen...\n\nBottom line? Try Ravi Soups. They are nice and their food is cool!\n\nOnly reason I didn\'t give them 4-stars is that they kinda goofed my order  so it took 5 - 10 minutes longer that it normally would have. Also  was keen to try Burrito Bandidos as my other option  so a little bummed that I didn\'t get a steak burrito...   ;)\n\nEnjoy!', 'Checked this place out based on the Yelp ratings. Was totally worth it. Got the Curried Lamb wrap for $8.99  which had in it: lamb  baby spinach  yams  pineapple  mango  lime chili and mint cilantro. Was a little on the spicy side and could have used some more meat but other than that very mouth watering good! Friendly service as well. Left feeling satisfied. Will definitely be back.', 'Three stars for food and an extra star for the patio!!! This restaurant has a very cozy and beautiful patio (backyard). \nI wish I could have a back yard like that in the city haha', 'I have been here many times for a light but hearty dinner. My go-to soup is the Porcini Mushroom Wild Rice Bisque. I love the biscuit served as a side with all the soups - it is always served warm  buttery and flaky. \n\nThere is an option to eat inside the restaurant. The back of Ravi Soups has a large wooden table with newspapers for patrons. It can be a casual place to catch up with friends while you enjoy your soup.\n\nI would not worry about the portion sizes not being adequate for dinner. The soups are large and the biscuit is filling. If you are worried about being full  I recommend ordering one of the wraps with the soup.', ""The soups are delicious and the portions are healthy in size... the salt content of the soups though  definitely unhealthy. If they could've kept the flavour without all that salt  it's be a full 4 stars.\n\nDon't get me wrong. It IS delicious. Tons of flavour but we were left super thirsty afterward due to the high sodium content.\n\nExtremely efficient operation and the staff seemed very friendly as they brought our soups over. We were there for dinner so it wasn't too packed  but it's small and I can easily see this place getting really busy at lunch time."", ""I'm not a big soup person so I wasn't wow'd by the soup I ordered. But the curried lamb wrap was amazing. If I go back here I'll just stick with a wrap. I also found this place a bit over priced.  I went at lunch and the place was pretty busy but I got my order quick."", ""I WISH THEY HAD A LOCATION CLOSER TO ME! \n\nA friend and I had the pleasure of eating here in the summer. I've heard amazing things about the legendary Ravi's Soups and had to have a taste.\n\nThe soups are rich and full of flavour. This is important because I love soup and it's so hard to find a soup that is rich and full of flavour. I literally ate every last drop. My sandwich was amazing and it was full as well. I had a wrap that fell apart because that's how full it was! Ravi gives you your money's worth!\n\nIt's a bit pricey  but I got a soup sandwich combo which was more than enough to fill me up. \n\nWe ate on the patio and it was so cute and intimate. This is a great place to have lunch  grab lunch and go  or just spend an afternoon with friends. I love the oak table in the middle of the bistro."", 'A little overrated here on Yelp.  It\'s ok but end of day it\'s just a soup and wrap joint.  Not a cheap one either.  I had the mushroom ""bisque"" which had no cream in it so not sure how it can be called a bisque.  It was pretty flavourless to be honest - was in dire need of seasoning.  The chicken wrap was good but nothing really that special.  I think this place gets pretty high reviews because people seem to go crazy for anything with some Indian spices in it.  It also has the kind of location and decor that will make the average suburbanite feel downtown cool for having eaten there.', 'Feeling under the weather due to a cold  I wanted some soup.  After doing some search I found out that Ravi soups is only 10 minutes away from my work  so I made the trek.\n\nIt. Was. Worth. It.\n\nI had a soup & wrap combo.  Modestly priced at $10.99 it was worth every penny.  The soup (chicken broth) was a lot heartier than I expected  and packed a pleasant kick.  The quantity of fresh vegetables in the broth  and the flavour  more than made up for its ""lunch size"".  Moving on to the pork wrap  I was treated to another taste sensation.  The first bite  literally  opened up my taste buds.  And every bite thereafter was just as good as the first.\n\nI went before the lunch rush (before 11:30) and the place was pretty much empty except for one of the staff lugging vegetables to the kitchen area.  The enclosed back area is very secluded and made a great place to read a book while eating my meal.  Presentation of the food was excellent: everything was placed on a miniature lazy susan  so it was easy to just ""spin"" each plate in front of me.\n\nMy only complaint was that the wrap was a little *too* juicy and I managed to get some all over my hands  but I feel that the juiciness goes to the freshness of the product.  All said it was worth the trek  and my cold seems to have run away from the spices in the soup.  I\'ll try out the takeout next time to see if it is as good when I get back to my office.', ""I regularly visit here for my lunch break during weekdays  and this place consistently delivers fresh  affordable  delicious food in an area that is full of overpriced and underwhelming restaurants. The decor is warm  with an open kitchen  wood furniture and eccentric art. I recommend coming early since the place gets packed for lunch  and that alone is an indicator of popular this place is. Having tried every dish on the menu  my favourite is the corn chowder and the Ravi stew  both hearty and bursting with flavour. There are veggie options and the service is always quick and friendly.  \n\nI also love the back patio with the colourful murals  it's a quiet oasis in the middle of this chaotic street!"", 'To tell you the truth  from my limited experience of non Asian soups  I found most Western soups I got from restaurant really uninspiring. Either they are so creamy  so salty (really need to watch my sodium level)  tasted like canned soup and full of MSG. \n\nPorcini Mushroom Bisque we ordered during our Mega food crawl is A-OK! The truffle oil is really the star of the show.. just smelling the oh so good and enriching smell just makes me heart go WoW! I think if I am going to have a real lunch at Ravi Soup  I would have order the combo with a wrap because eating/drinking this light soup alone will be too light a lunch for me. (OK  I guess I can always have dessert after!)\n\nThe patio at the back for sure is a nice place for a leisure lunch during a nice day. I found inside is a little stuffy and steamy...(maybe from the steam of all these soup warming up on the stoves)\n\nHowever  I can find myself dropping by on a cold freezing snowy winter afternoon for some warm comfort soup......hmmmmm', ""Fantastic! Had the veggie wrap and porchini soup  both were truly amazing. Can't wait to get back to Toronto so I can visit them again"", 'My friends and I came here to warm up after walking around the city for a bit  and it was absolutely delicious! I ordered the corn and crab chowder and flank steak wrap combo. My friends ordered the butternut squash soup and a chicken wrap. The soups were full of flavor and depth  and the wraps were super filling! I loved the edamame and chipotle aioli in my steak wrap. This is definitely the place to go if you want a healthy  delicious meal. \n\nAlso  bonus points for the awesome wooden table in the middle of the dining area!', 'Excellent excellent excellent! Love this place!!! \nTried the chicken broth and it is amazing\nPricing is good\nService is prompt\nGreat tasty food', 'I ordered their soup via hurrier. I selected the Chicken Hot Pot Soup which was lovely and the Ravi stew. However  I think for the price the quantity was not sufficient. The soups were tasty but slightly peppery and the serving needed to be way larger for $9-$12 per soup.', ""I was there today and ordered the corn chowder. I thought because it was a chowder I would be getting a hearty cream based soup  but it was completely the opposite. Maybe I made an unfair assumption based on t he word 'chowder' but the soup was not creamy at all  it was a yellow soup that had a lot of spice. I actually thought they'd given me the wrong soup until I checked photos online. \n\nThe soup wasn't bad  but there was hardly anything in it besides the actual liquid. There was a very small amount of corn and blue crab. I was just very confused and felt like it wasn't what I'd ordered.

Take out is probably your best bet. The place has a big back patio. It's surprisingly big. I usually get the $11 soup and wrap combo. It's a good amount of food  and it's probably easier to justify spending that much on the combo rather than $9-10 for big bowls of fancy soup. I'd like to talk about all the different soups you can get  but I keep getting the Butternut Squash. it's too good.\n\nThe restaurant is run by a bunch of Tamil dudes  so that's basically a reason to go right there.

The place was buzzing but not overly crowded. We ordered the flank steak wrap and the Chicken Hot Pot Broth soup. The wrap was delicious and the serving size was plenty. I loved the biscuit on the side with the red pepper jelly. The only reason this review is getting 4 stars is that  although the soup was great  it was lacking salt.

Will definitely be going back!', ""Having heard great things about Ravi Soup  I came for dinner one day. I was a little surprised to see that it was almost deserted  but perhaps this is a more popular spot for lunch and take-out. Undeterred  I ordered two soup combos to share. In total  I tried the following:\n\nPorcini Mushroom Wild Rice Bisque - this was my favourite soup of the two I tried. It was rich with mushroom flavours  yet not very heavy because it wasn't super creamy. I love a good mushroom bisque and this definitely hit the spot.\n\nCorn Chowder - certainly a heartier choice of the two  this one is filled with blue crab  thai basil  and garnished with crispy shallots. I think I would get full if I just had this and a biscuit on the side\n\nRoasted Free Range Chicken wrap - with roasted yams  baby spinach  edamame  caramelized onions  tomato chutney & chipotle mayo. I love the combination of roasted yam and edamame in the wraps (I think the put this in almost every other wrap). The chicken itself wasn't very memorable  but the chipotle mayo was quite delicious.\n\nFlank Steak Wrap - with roasted yams  baby spinach  caramelized onions  mushrooms  edamame  brie  and chipotle mayo. This was my favourite item- I like it better than any of the soup here. The portion is enormous  sure to make anyone full. I saved half of my wrap for lunch next day and it was still very delicious.

I would highly recommend!\n\nAll in all  Ravi Soup is a great cheaper eats option in the Entertainment district!"", ""One of the best lunch locations I've yet experienced in Toronto. The presentation of the wrap+soup combo is artsy and utilitarian; the soups are unique and full of umami; the wraps sometimes have a bit too many spices in them  but always end up satisfying you.

Large helping of Soups or a Wrap range from $7.99-$8.99. If you're very hungry then get the soup AND wrap combo. \n\nFOOD: I love their intense flavours. Some border on spicy/hot. If you're one who prefers milder and subtler flavours  - Ravi may not be your cup of tea/soup. :P\n\nIf you order soup on it's own  it comes with this awesome flaky scone  with red pepper jelly on the side (a lovely complement to their soups).\n\n\nI'm definitely a repeat customer here!"", 'Fantastic food  quick service.

I look at the menu board to see what to order and there is a good selection of soups to choose from. I chose the Shrimp Bisque Soup to go and took it back to the office. I opened it up and started  and sure enough the soup was delicious. The take out soup container was pretty small. I should have opted for dining in as the amount of soup in the bowls were more worth while. The soup came with some kind of biscuit. It was fluffy and moist. Great healing food for my sickness.

The chowder was delish  with a refreshing aroma of corn  and (very) small bits of real crab  really enjoyed that.

I've tried every dish on the small menu and you honestly can't go wrong with any choice. My favourites are the Flank Steak Wrap (who knew edamame and brie would be so good together??) and the Ravi Stew.\n\nThe interiors mainly accommodate the open kitchen but there's a large communal reclaimed wood table in the back. Orders are taken at the counter and can be taken out or delivered to the seating area - it gets especially packed during lunch but service is fast.

This was my first meal on a trip to Toronto and it sure was a memorable one. I had a pork shoulder sandwich thats is made with cole slaw  tamarind ketchup and cilantro. That combination is one of the most delicious sandwiches I've ever had. The sweetness of the ketchup and coleslaw mixed with the pork shoulder is outstanding and the cilantro just puts the icing on the cake. They also dont go light on the meat portions which is a huge plus. There's nothing worse than a wrap that is full of everything except meat\n\nThere's also a really awesome courtyard in the back of the restaurant with tables and umbrellas for outside dining in the warmer months.

I just moved to Toronto from the Windy City and with Chicago being the Restaurant Capital of the US  I was worried about how Toronto would stack up with all the chains I have seen downtown.  Ravi's has helped to quell my fears.\n\nThe soup I had was filled with fresh (flavorful) ingredients  not only broth  and topped all the soups I have had tried in Chicago...and I am not even a soup person  but am now converted.  If you like going to places like Whole Foods to get soup quickly  save some money and go to Ravi's which is way better (Whole Foods prepared soups are good in their own right).  \n\nThe wrap was also great as well; flavorful with great ingredients.  But the soup wowed me since I rarely have soup unless I get sick or feel like having some on the off occassion.  Now  I feel comfortable having soup more regularly  and the wrap/soup combo was quite filling.\n\nThe operation itself was very efficient.  There was one cashier and one chef in a tiny open kitchen where you could basically watch him make your food  and he got it done fast.\n\nHopefully more people in the city start supporting independent establishments like Ravi's soups so that we see the rise of similar places that can give fast food chains a run for their money.  From my experience at Toronto establishments in general so far  I am starting to feel Torontoans may be a bit harder on their restaurants than their Chicago counterparts  but I am too early in the game to have my final say on that."", ""I love this place. I have had all the wraps and I believe it's one of the best places in Toronto based on flavor and value.  My personal favorite is the curied lamb wrap with spinach  mango chutney  and a pineapple salsa.  The tortia is crisped with butter on both sides (my favorite!). The lamb is spicy  intense  and buttery soft.  Quite a nice balance of a light sweetness of the pineapple salsa and mango chutney. I will note that the wrap is quite intense  so if our sensitive to spice  choose another wrap.  The roasted vegetable wrap with a pineapple salsa and chipotle mayo is also quite yummy.  \nAnother amazing things about these wraps are the value.  Great prices and great food!

The meal ended up costing about $12 - which is sort of on par when in comparison to places like soup nutsy.  Anyhow  after one sip of the porcini mushroom soup  I was totally sold!

In case you were wondering why there are like 5 different prices for the wrap and soup combo  the more expensive the individual wrap or soup you choose the higher the price of your combo.\n\nThe Ravi stew was good with a decent amount of ingredients in it. The wrap was huge and was packed full of meat and veggies. I did find the roast pork a little dry but overall it was ok.\n\nThere isn't  too much space in the seating area and given how busy this place can get might want to consider doing take-out \n\nOverall a pretty good place if you like soups and prices are reasonable for what you get.

I placed my order and the gentleman on the other end of the line said hey would call when the food was ready  and prior to delivery.  He called back  and 10 minutes later  the food was at my door.  I thought this was a very nice courtesy.  I took the lid of all the soups and stew  thinking I would taste each and just have one for my dinner.  I went from butternut squash soup  to porcini mushroom soup  to chicken  hot pot broth  to ravistew.  With each item  I could not believe how amazingly fresh and flavourful  each one was.  Each soup was unique and different  with spectacular ingredients. I just kept going back and forth from one to the other  enjoying the different flavours. The butternut squash soup is by far the best I have ever had. Ravi is King of Soups.  To top things off  the soups unexpectedly came with a delicious cheddar cheese biscuit that could probably rival some of the top French pastry chefs (I'm not kidding)!!  Finally  I couldn't resist biting into the wraps that were going to be saved for the next day's lunch. I ordered both the Free Range Chicken Wrap  and the Flank Steak Wrap. Once again  I was pleasantly surprised by the freshness  flavour combinations  and quality of ingredients. Ravi you have a new fan.  Now if you could just lower the delivery minimum to $30.00  and reduce the delivery fee  I would be in Ravi heaven."", ""It was a rainy day in town  and I was seriously craving soup. I've heard great things about Ravi's  and since all the other places famous for soup (Soup Nutsy  etc.) were all closed  we decided to trek to Ravi's for a taste.\n\nI  naively  thought that the soup and wrap combo came with a full side of soup.

The lunchtime crowd was young  diverse and hip  a typical slice of downtown Toronto.  Order at the counter after looking behind the counter on the wall at the menu.

No big deal  because what I ordered was fabulous.\n\nHere's the deal:  soups and wraps  a couple of sides and drinks.  But the soups and wraps are really inventive.  Get the combo meal  which offers you a smaller bowl of one of their soups along with a smaller wrap of your choosing.  $13 and change.  \n\nThe 'smaller' is a bit of a misnomer here.  Both the wrap and the soup serving size was perfectly adequate to fill the chasm that was my tummy today.  If you need a full size bowl of soup or wrap  the things look gargantuan.  \n\nThe vacuum in my gut was filled by the Lamb wrap (which has yams  spinach  big chunks of tender and lean lamb simmered in a surprisingly spicy curry.

I couldn't eat it fast enough.\n\nAnd the soup I tried was the corn chowder with little chunks of crab meat.  Also excellent  but perhaps a few more chunks of crab meat would have made it sublime.  \n\nThere's a massive single table made out of the center of an enormous tree  ringed with at least 14 stools.

My sister dragged me here on a cold and windy evening  and as I stepped inside  I felt my already bad mood sour even more. The front area was dark and relatively deserted  with only one employee working in the kitchen and front of house. We weren\'t acknowledged for at least five minutes and had no idea what the process was - were we to seat ourselves? Did we order and pay first  or pay later? We stood murmuring awkwardly until our orders were taken and we were told to take a seat. I opted for the oven roasted veggie wrap  while my sister selected the soup and wrap combo. As we sat down  I couldn\'t help but notice the lingering scent of bleach that wafted throughout the back area of the restaurant  and the whole atmosphere of the space made me feel as if I had tunnelled underground to drink spirits with gnomes. When my wrap arrived - spinning around and around on a lopsided lazy Susan  and accompanied by a really sad and wilted salad on the side - I bit into it eagerly  and the first taste was actually quite good. As I kept eating  however  I found myself met with an overwhelming amount of dripping chipotle mayo coupled with HUGE chunks of vegetables. I got about three-quarters of the way through my wrap before my stomach started turning and I couldn\'t bring myself to eat any more. Maybe it was a mistake to come to a place with ""soups"" in the name and not order a soup. I was really hoping that a good meal would lift my spirits  and although my sister had positive things to say about her food  my experience here was a real miss for me. I definitely wouldn\'t go out of my way to come here again.', 'Three stars for food and an extra star for the patio!!! It was very beautiful environment!', ""This place is always busy  so it's hard to find a place to eat if you're coming near a meal time. However  the soup is 100% worth it.

Absolutely phenomenal flavors  quick service  and super-reasonable prices. \n\nI love that they have an option to get a soup and wrap as I am the most indecisive person in the world. The wrap with a smaller portion of soup was absolutely perfect. I had the roasted pork shoulder wrap  which comes with ""RaviSlaw"" - I have no idea what this is  but assume that a key ingredient is crack because I did not want to stop eating it. OMG. This was accompanied by a bowl of the corn chowder which comes with nice big chunks of blue crab. Mmm. The icing on the hypothetical cake was a delicious biscuit - imagine Red Lobster\'s cheesy biscuits  but classier - served with an awesome savory jam. SO FREAKING GOOD. \n\nI came with 6 friends and it only took about 10 minutes for all of us to be served.

The broth based soups not as much but I guess that just comes down to personal preference."", 'I came here for lunch today and expected to be blown away from the reviews here on Yelp. I have to say  I was a bit disappointed - while the food was alright  I didn\'t think it was spectacular.\n\nSince it was such a nice day  we had our lunch on their patio at the back. It\'s a cool space with tons of plant life and a gorgeous mural on one of the walls. The food is brought out to you on an individual sized lazy susan and the wait staff are pretty nice.\n\nI had the Corn Chowder and Curried Lamb Wrap combo. The corn chowder was alright - while the soup tasted as though it was made from scratch  I was expecting more of a ""fresh"" corn flavour though  if that makes sense. The crab in the soup seemed to have a bit of a fishy flavour and wasn\'t as sweet as I hoped it would be. The wrap was the better choice of the two - there was a nice toast on it and the ingredients inside were also very fresh! The only thing about it that I didn\'t like was that the spice on the curry was a bit too overwhelming for me - I can\'t handle very spicy foods. For that reason  I wish there was a bit more mango-pineappe salsa to cut the heat. \n\nMy lunch partner had the Roasted Red Pepper Bisque with the Flank Steak Wrap (sorry I can\'t remember what exactly it\'s called!). He loved his soup (I agree with him  it has a very nice  rich flavour to it) and the little bits of shrimp inside there were perfectly cooked. We both liked my wrap more of the two though because there was some funny tasting sauce on the Flank Steak that we thought was a bit overwhelming. Both soups also had Thai Basil on them I think  and I liked that special little touch! The herbs were fresh and bright tasting and made things a bit more interesting.\n\nOur lunch came to a total of $24.84  which wasn\'t too bad for food that you\'re getting downtown I guess. I wasn\'t blown away  but all in all  it was pretty decent - better than anything you\'d get on the PATH at least! It\'s a lunch place worth trying  but don\'t expect it to perform miracles.\n\nEDIT: Ahhh okay. So after trying some other stuff to eat downtown  I realized that my expectations for Ravi Soup might have been a little bit inflated - compared to the other stuff available  it\'s probably considered really good food. Thus  I am bumping this review up to 3.5 stars! The soups all contain a variety of textures for contrast and also contain many more complex layers of flavour than at some other places (say for example  the hand-held and sippable soup cups Petit Four).  So while it\'s a little better in my books  it still isn\'t the best.']"

Wont waste my money again', ""Got married this weekend - and wanted to celebrate at The Salt Cellar on Saturday Night. \nI have been here several times  and the food is always great! \nWe made a reservation for 8:00 PM. \nService was great - they messed up my order  and was able to get the correct order in on-the-fly... the only part that sucked was that my husband had waited until my food came out because he didn't want to eat without me. So  he had to eat cold lobster. (I told him about 15 times to please eat. I would just pick off of his plate.)\nI felt horrible - it was an easy mistake by the server. \nWe did not give him a hard time  because he was very stressed out and felt awful about making a mistake."", ""The Salt Cellar is a true gem! They fly their fresh fish and seafood selections flown in from around the world. Clams from New England  Steak from New Zealand  Crabs from Maryland  etc. My first experience was a weeknight in August with a friend. We were fortunate to be seated in Toni's section. Toni is knowledgable  friendly and offered fantastic suggestions. \n\nThe oysters were incredible  very large and flavorful. It was my first time having turtle soup and I was very impressed - Salt Cellar delivered on all the build up of the controversial dish. The sauteed scallops were exceptional. I tried to request a quart of the sauce to-go  but to no avai. The crowning glory is the Maryland Crab Cakes. They have large pieces of Crab  with only enough of the other ingredients to hold it together. They are grilled to a crispy goodness. I have returned 4 more times  and always order them.\n\nThe restaurant is an actual cellar  making for fun conversation - be sure to check out the ceiling carefully. The restaurant atmosphere is a balance between upscale and comfortable - great for romantic dinner or family events. On weekends  it's a popular date place. The bar offers a slightly more casual atmosphere. Alex the bartender is personable and makes a great drink.\n\nThis place is an excellent choice for both tourists  locals and regulars."", ""As you walk in this place it seems awesome...It's underground! Walking down the stairwell was fun! \n(minus the heat-felt like youre walking into an oven) \n\nThe server was awesome. She knew her job well. She does crack your crab legs for you- that was cool.\nOther than that  the food quality was poor. \n\nThis was extremely overpriced for the quality! We were in a  party of six and all of us had to  agree we were all upset about the blan food. Im not a huge salt fan- I had to put salt on my food about 4 times to give it flavor. I do not think an expensive menu makes for good food."", ""I love this place... I love their happy hour it's so delicious... mussels are so good along with their oysters on a half shell. I also like their lobster tail. Delicious and service is always amazing."", ""Who'd have thought that in a part of the country where basements are nonexistent  there's a fantastic restaurant that's entirely underground? Salt Cellar has always been my favorite place for sea food in the valley. The quality of the fish is always good and fresh  especially when you consider that Arizona is a landlocked state. \n\nMy girlfriend and I had a wonderful Valentine's Day dinner at the Salt Cellar. She can't eat shell fish  which eliminates a lot of the items on the menu  but there's plenty of good options to pick from. We split a Halibut ceviche appetizer  which may have been the best ceviche I've ever had. Nothing against shrimp  but the Halibut is much more flavorful. I had Swordfish with mango salsa. The mango salsa was unreal. They left everything cut in big chunks  which was a little shocking at first  but it covered the whole fish  and was quite tasty. The fish itself tasted a little dry to me at first  but as I got to the center  I found that it was perfectly cooked  and the salsa continued to enhance the flavor. My girlfriend had Mahi. I tried a bite  and it was also delicious. \n\nEntrees are around the prices you'd expect to pay at this type of establishment. But orders come with a salad  vegetables  and choice of potato or rice. Two glasses of wine  an appetizer  and two entrees cost a little more than $100 (not including tip). Not bad for a special occasion. \n\nThe place is very small (be prepared to be seated a little too close to the party next to) so reservations are a must. For parties of two  you can make them on Salt Cellar's website. They only thing I think Salt cellar needs is an update. While the dim lighting  wood and nautical theme is cool. The walls and art hanging on them walk a fine line between out of date and nostalgic."", ""My husband and I went here for our anniversary last night. We made a reservation even though I thought we might not have to since it was a week day. But glad I did because they were still pretty busy even for a Thursday. \n\nWe started off with the sauteed shrimp san remo that our server recommend and I have to say it was amazing!! Our serve even told us to dip our bread in the sauce and I couldn't stop eating it. I almost wished we had ordered a second one. Would highly recommend getting the sauteed shrimp san remo as your appetizer. \n\nFor my entree I got the sauteed sea scallops and add the crab legs as well. They crack the crab for you table side so you don't have to work for your crab which I think is great! My entree was very good  I very much enjoyed both the scallops and the crab was awesome! Almost wished I had just ordered a bigger crab entree. My husband got the beef wellington and crab legs as well. He very much enjoyed the wellington and he couldn't get enough of the crab either! \n\nWe had a great time over all and were very happy with everything we ordered.

Romantic.', ""Celebrated our 1 year wedding anniversary here and our experience was wonderful! We were asked to wait in the bar before we were seated and were  offered drinks right away. We were then seated within 5 minutes. We started off with muscles and three different breads with broth and butter as dipping sauces. Very delicious! As for our main dishes  hubby ordered the halibut with lemon and caper butter and I ordered the Alaskan king crab legs which both dishes were shared. Diana  our fabulous waitress  cracked the crab legs for us at our table so it was easier to eat. For dessert  we shared the amaretto cheese cake  which was very tasty and not overly sweet. \nFor those who are slightly claustrophobic  you actually don't feel so closed in with the restaurant being underground  so I don't think it would be a problem. It was a great experience with delicious food  elegant  but casual ambiance & wonderful service! They have a separate bar service to make sure your drinks are full throughout dinner. \n\nIt's such a neat and romantic place to dine for any special occasion!\n\nHighly recommend this place!"", 'This place has amazing food  I had the fried shrimp and oysters. They were AMAZING with the cocktail sauce and horseradish. So it was a 10 out of 10 for me. The fried shrimp was so crunchy like a chip  while the inside like a juicy crab.', ""We enjoying coming here for the fabulous seafood. Plan ahead and make a reservation.  If you can handle the 3 pound lobster make sure you reserve that too! It is a unique little restaurant that's easy to drive by  but don't be misled by its looks  it's the best seafood in town and it's all underground!"", 'Went this past weekend for our anniversary. They never fail to please! We try to go a couple of times a year  usually special occasions. Atmosphere is excellent and food is just delightful! King crabs legs- to die for!!!!', 'So I came here on a whim because it was a Sunday night and most places were already closed so my options were limited. I wanted something quick and they\'re open until 1:00 am  I had this place already bookmarked so I said ""why not?"" because at that point I was starving! It\'s located off the beaten path in the south east area of Scottsdale and when I approached the building I was confused because it looked like nothing was there!\n\nWhen I walked in the door......wow what a surprise! It\'s LITERALLY a cellar lol! You walk down this really nice all wood staircase and wood walls/ceiling  dark with movie theater type lighting guiding the path and a chandelier to top it off of course! I finally got to the bottom where I saw a guy and asked ""am I in the right place?"" because I didn\'t notice the sign saying where the heck I was! He laughed and said yes. I asked if I could get something to go and he said I could but I wanted the crab cakes with vegetables and I could only dine in to get it. I said why not it\'ll be a quick bite so I agreed and followed another lady to my seat.\n\nI got to the dining area and man! I was not expecting a 5 star type dining place! Dim lighting  relaxing music  setting the mood perfectly. Everyone was all dressed up and I walk in with a regular blouse and jeans  whatever. Hostess sits me down then I\'m greeted by ANOTHER person who asks if I wanted some wine to start off with  me not being a wine connoisseur I nicely declined the offer but I took a water and told him I was ready to order. Didn\'t even look at the menu so honestly I didn\'t know price of the meal before I ordered! He started me off with some bread and a side salad  salad was amazing and a meal itself (bread not so much  a little too bland and dry)! I order crab cakes with vegetables and a baked potato  the wait for a simple order was kind of ridiculous in my opinion  or maybe I was just really hungry  but I think they could\'ve brought it out sooner than they did.\n\nI finally get my entrée and the presentation was beautiful! Nicely plated  and they put a lemon cut open into a star shaped with some chilé on top  awesome! Baked potato with just chives was pretty good  and the vegetables with a light cheese sauce was great! Saving the review for the crab cakes for last because.....this is where the 4 stars comes in. Crab cakes could have been much better in my opinion  I like crab cakes to have big chunks of crab and less breading. These crab cakes had a lot of crab  however it was shredded crab so the texture was really hard to get used to  because it was kind of mushy and just didn\'t taste as good as a chunky crab cake. The flavors were there however! All in all I enjoyed majority of my meal (just not the main item unfortunately). The price was a reasonable price for the service that I received  it would have gotten 5 stars if I enjoyed the crab cake as much as I enjoyed everything else and if it didn\'t take so long my for my food to arrive. I will come back but I will try something else next time.', ""Everyone at the Salt Cellar is AMAZING!!  The food is killer the service of the staff is impeccable and the owners really do care about their customers.  We had my Moms 50th birthday party there.  It wasn't a small group either  there where 22 of us  for any small restaurant like the Salt Cellar that is a really large party.  The staff was super attentive to all of us making sure my Mom was given extra special care.  Glasses never went dry and food came out quick  hot  and all  together!   I can't express how pleased I am with the wonderful service we received."", 'The FRESHEST seafood I\'ve found in Arizona resides in a basement. Well  really an underground restaurant. And being from Baltimore originally  I like to think I know a thing or two about fresh seafood! \n\nMy wife and I decided to splurge for our anniversary and we mutually agreed that seafood was the way to go! Upon arrival for our resevation we descended the stairs to the ""cellar"" where we were greeted and shown to our table right away. We were seated in a dimly lit dining room with a few other couples  and despite what other Yelpers have complained about  we did not feel the least bit crowded!\n\nOn to the food!! We ordered the bucket of steamed clams for an appetizer (looking back I wish I had ordered the escargot as well). They were steamed to perfection with good texture and flavor  and served with drawn butter and a clam wash! For my entree I ordered the Blackened Sea Bass and my wife ordered the Baked Stuffed Lobster at the recommendation on MANY Yelpers! Our meals were amazing! My fish was seared to a light crisp outside  but was still soft and full of flavor inside! Her lobster was stuffed with WHOLE sea scallops and jumbo lump MD blue crab meat! Our waiter Tony even cracked it for her at our table!\n\nAll in all I\'m very impressed with the Salt Cellar... food AND service! Don\'t believe the bad reviews out there. Bottom line: this is REAL  fresh seafood!', ""Old school steakhouse feel. Service is fantastic and the range of food on offer is impressive.\n\nTurtle soup is best I've had and the deserts are great as are the mussels (when available).\n\nBUT...fish and lobster was overcooked on both occasions I had them.\n\nNot often I say this but the quality of wait staff balanced out the disappointment around the over cooking.\n\nGood drinks and that's important."", ""I've eaten here many times  but none as bad as last night.\nService was excellent  and highly attentive.\nFood  absolutely horrible.\n\nMy expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood. After all  they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye. \nWhat I was hoping for was a 1- 1-1/2' thick steak  cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered. \nWhat I got a a 3/4 in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat  gristle  and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style. \nSalad  similar to something you could get at Chick Filet\nVeggies  blah.\nBread basket  ample  but day old  and if not  it certainly wasn't fresh. \n\nIn addition to bad food  we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables  listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye  and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French  until the waiter showed up  then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English. \n\nI've had it with this place.\nIf I'm going to pay 150 bucks for dinner  it'll be at Mortons  or Maestro where the steaks are 1-1/2 in thick  cooked to perfection  and half of it doesnt wind up on the plate as fat and gristle"", ""Can't believe it is still open after 40 years...\n\nIf there ever is a fire  everyone is dead...Seriously...Only the stairs up will get you out....Yes folks  it is a Cellar....\n."", 'The young guy at the front door was very pleasant and helpful. After that  we received literally the worst service I have ever gotten in my life. Bartenders were rude and continuously bad mouthed us right in front of our faces. I have never seen anyone in the service industry seem this annoyed by having customers at their bar. We even had a former Salt Cellar employee with us. We will not return. Too bad because the food was excellent as always.', ""Great place for a celebratory dinner. Primarily seafood menu with giant stuff lobsters. This is my husband's favorite place to go in Phoenix.  We go for his birthday every year.  It is a bit pricey  but definitely worth it. \n\nThere is a romantic ambiance with dim lights. ASK FOR A BOOTH!  Otherwise the tables are pretty close together so it feels like you're part of their experience too."", 'Came back to this famous place after years of not going and ordered the appetizer fish and chips. It was the very best fish and chips I have ever eaten anywhere. Just wish the portion size were just a bit more and the price was a bit less. But will definitely be going there again to have something different on the menu because if they can make fish and chips this great the rest of the meals must be fantastic. The beer and drinks were served in smaller than usual glasses put charges the same price as if it were 12 ounces or more', ""Obviously not a hidden gem with 350+ reviews but I do like that it is kind of away from the heart of old town. It has a very cool vibe as you park and walk down stairs to main area of the restaurant. It has a rustic/80-90's fine dining vibe but the staff is courteous energetic without being overbearing. It seems like they work together as you will typically have a server for the night but someone else who takes care of drinks. Respectable selection of wines and liquor. I paid the bill but didn't want to look at the breakdown of what my drinks cost :) . This not for coupon or penny pincher folk but definitely a good experience. The first time I came I had the lobster with stuffed crab but I told myself I would get something else this time. I was starving so couldn't settle for just crab legs or crab cakes. Wasnt planning on a surf turf kinda night but I knew it would fill me up. My mom had the grouper grilled with the blackened (cajun seasoning). We both had the mixed veggies and salads. We all tried the turtle soup just so we could say we had it and Manhattan clam chowder as well. I actually prefer teh tomato base instead of the creamy one because that tends be lots of chunks of potatoes. We had the halibut ceviche and the shrimp mushroom appetizer. It was funny that we were more focused on dipping the bread in the sauce than eating the actual shrimp. The shrimp were semi dinky in size but we had plenty of other food to keep us happy. Creme brule to seal the deal and perfect way to end the night. Thank you good people of Salt Cellar for a respectable seafood meal in the desert"", 'Not being a fish person (so take that as you wish) my mother wanted to take my wife and I with my daughter here for dinner because she likes it (on Friday 6/10/2016). I found the whole experience to be very overpriced for the quality they deliver. Starting with the parking lot.\n\nI started with the Turtle soup  being from Philadelphia  Snapper soup was a staple at a restaurant there. Although the Salt Cellar\'s soup lacked seasoning (and lazily puts the sherry on the side) I didn\'t think it was that bad. I\'d give it a 3/5.\n\nSalad dressings choices leave to be desired  and I can\'t eat mushrooms -- but the waiter never told us they had mushrooms and by the next time I saw him our entree was there.\n\nI had the Beef Wellington  and so did my daughter. We both found it overcooked -- and no seasonings. The raspberry syrup they dump on it is absolutely awful. It totally killed the whole thing  but I suppose when they don\'t season it  that\'s what you should expect -- heavy syrups.  And definitely not Grade A cuts  nothing more than you can buy at a supermarket (for the lower grades)\n\nMy wife had the salmon which she said was okay  they spend more time in presentation than flavoring again.\n\nThe free desert they give us for our anniversary for chocolate cake seemed liked they found a  stale doughnut from a store and microwaved it with chocolate sauce. Good thing we didn\'t pay for that.\n\nI\'d say this place is overpriced by at least 200-300% given the quality. The staff is friendly  but the waiter doesn\'t get you drinks  some cocktail one does -- so be prepared to get everything different. The beer she refilled wasn\'t the same I had (nor did she ask) and she refilled my mom\'s Gin and Tonic with Sprite -- but charged us for a Gin and Tonic.\n\nWe didn\'t eat half the meal as the sides were barely edible - the kus was nothing but water and the broccoli and cauliflower had some sauce on it that made it taste and smell ""off"". The baked potato was microwaved and not even scrubbed. \n\nNot one elicit response from the waiter  cocktail waitress  or even a manager to come up and ask what\'s wrong given that we barely ate 30% of the meal. I\'m guessing they just bank on overpriced  completely under-quality food and hope that people still believe this is some type of ""place to be seen"" given its Scottsdale address.\n\nI\'d expect more from a place that averages about $60 a plate with tip and drinks -- you should also. Their management seems to have no issues with it.', ""I had no ideas this place was here. So small from outside  I drove passed here many times for the past 16 years but didn't even notice. On the day I came here  I missed the exit from the freeway and was driving up Hayden Rd to get back to Scottsdale eventually  when my friend said there should be a good seafood restaurant nearby  and when he spotted this place  we decided to try here instead.\n\nTaking the stairs down  I felt like I was going down to a wine cellar. It's such an old school  I felt like I was back in time. Apparently they haven't changed for over 40 years. I liked their classy ambiance. \n\nServer said halibut was fresh so we shared halibut ceviche. Fish was fresh and really liked the taste of ceviche. It was so hot that night  fresh appetizer was perfect choice.\n\nYakimono Hawaiian ahi had a great flavor. One of the best ahi I had before. Outside was charred just perfectly  I enjoyed every bite of my ahi.\n\nPortion size was very big. I didn't have enough room left in my tummy for desert. \n\nServer was as friendly as he gets. He sounded like he's been working there for a long time and knew what he was doing. I had such a good time there that night  I hope I can come back here again soon."", ""As a lover of seafood I have been wanting to go here for awhile but given the prices just couldn't get myself to go. That was a mistake! I did get a nice spot bonus from work so decided that it was time to head down into the cellar. The food was GREAT. The service was even better. I loved our waitress. We had oysters  lobster and dessert. Even the people there were friendly as we were talking to our neighbors who said they will just split a dish  so my excuse that it's too expensive to go regularly may have just gone out the window. If you want a seafood spot in the desert  this is it!"", ""Just average.  It's cool that it is in the basement but they pack you in like sardines.  My wife and I felt like we were on top of the other tables.  We had the halibut ceviche  average. Escargot appetizer  ok. My wife had the salmon  average and I had the halibut checks  again average.  \n\nIf you want seafood  I suggest skipping this place and go somewhere else."", 'Food: the food is good  I got the small steak and crab legs. I enjoyed it  but I honestly was expecting a little more. What I would have liked to see was something a little more flavorful that seems like a chef made it  rather than it feeling like something I could have made.\n\nService: the service was adequate. However at a nice restaurant such as this I have the tendency to expect above average service  seeing as they generally get an above average tip since the food is pricy.\n\nLocation: I think the ambiance is what people love so much about this place. It is underground and gives you the sense that you are on a boat. The lighting is dimmed so low that at times it can be hard to see the menu. I used the flash light on my phone to view the menu.', ""A couple weeks ago I was set to bring my sister in to enjoy some ahi  as she had been craving it for 9 months. It ended up being 4 of us and I'm so glad it was as we were able to enjoy multiple dishes. We started with the scallops  which are a must have  and an escargot. For dinner we had the ahi  of course  the crab legs  and the salmon Oscar. (I am actually headed back for dinner tonight  because it was all amazing.) We also enjoyed 2 bottles of wine. The wine list at the Salt Cellar amazes me. The prices are barely higher than what you pay at the store. Anyway  our server Cara was very attentive and knowledgable.

Loved it all and would absolutely go back .', 'Had a great date night with my husband. The macadamia nut halibut was wonderful. Server was great and gave us plenty of personal space. We told him we were not in any hurry and he respected that. My only concern was the abrupt /rude hostess when I called to make the reservation. Not friendly or welcoming at all. But on a good note the bartender and waiter made up for the lack of the hostess. Food was wonderful!', ""Tried the Salt Cellar for a special occasion.  We started with salads that had bottled dressing and vegetables that came out of a bag.  I ordered a steamed lobster and it clearly hadn't seen the ocean in a very long time.  It was obviously pre-cooked and re-heated.  My husband ordered the crab cakes and they were way more cake than crab.  Baked potatoes were lukewarm and the poor broccoli was smothered in some unidentified sauce.  The service was good but that's the only thing that was."", 'We have been going to the Salt Cellar for the past twenty years and have always raved about the food and the service and  of course  the atmosphere.  \nLast night  we went there for my birthday dinner.  We started appetizers  shrimp San Remos and Oysters Rockefeller.  The shrimp was delicious  but the Oysters were definitely lacking something and not up to par.  I had the baked stuffed shrimp (my favorite)  and again something was definitely lacking--flavor.  Our bill for four adults and two children was $300.  So prices have definitely gone up!  Even so  the service was excellent and our waiter was very knowledgeable. The cheesecake and chocolate cake was also delicious.   Unfortunately  my craving for Oysters Rockefeller and baked stuffed shrimp will have to be fulfilled elsewhere in the future.', ""I dined here a few years ago and then again this past Saturday and it still is just as amazing. We sat at the bar until it was time for our reservation and we tried the turtle soup. It literally tastes like beef stew. The bartender Dale was beyond amazing and made me a drink based on just a few things I said I liked. Chuck was our server for dinner and he was awesome. I had the crab legs and my husband had the stuffed lobster. Both were delicious. The only thing I don't like is how crammed you are but it's easy to get over.

There was absolutely no seasoning on my steak... no salt... no pepper... no flavor.\n\nIf the kitchen can't prepare a decent steak  they shouldn't have it on the menu and it shouldn't be $40.

I would rate this place 5 stars in both the service and quality of food. Definitely delicious fresh tasting seafood I've had in the valley. The baked lobster and Shrimp San Remo is a must get! I'm giving it 4 stars because it was a bit pricey.  I understand if this was at a high end fine dining restaurant maybe they can get away with the prices  but it isn't.

This is type of place that I would love to bring guest from out of town...a really neat and interesting restaurant experience.  The facility itself is well worn  interesting  and a bit eclectic.\n\nThe food was HIGH quality and very well prepared. We started with the Shrimp San Remo (which I read about on Yelp) and it was excellent.  I have never had anything  like it.  The sauce was even better on bread.

The wait and bar staff were all super friendly and well versed on the menu (our waitress even cracked our lobster and crab for us.)  The service was great and they did a very good job of taking care of us.\n\nI will say that being seated at 8:20 for our 7:30 reservations was frustrating and we met several other parties who had also been waiting nearly an hour.

The Manhattan Clam chowder was merely ok. No better than a C. If you appreciate a tomatoe based chowder  don't order it here. Go back to NYC.  Finally the Oysters Rockefeller. Meh. Better than some I've had like Casey Moores Oyster House in Tempe - the worst. But not in the league of Durants  downtown - fabulous. \n\nSo here is what irritated me. I ask the bartender about happy hour and he says $3.50 well drinks - darn good deal. I order two G&Ts (gin and tonic if you don't know).  About three or four drinks and our appetizers later  I pay the bill and we leave to head to Lon's at Hermosa for phase two. I thought the check was a little heavy  but we were all having fun  so what the heck. \n\nLater that night  I looked at the bill and the bartender had been using Tanqueray and charging me considerably more than $3.50. I can't say whether he was clipping me intentionally or if he misunderstood  but the net is he should have verified. Not pleased.

Highly recommend!!!', 'I only stayed one night in Phoenix so this was the restaurant of choice and I am very pleased with the selection. The service was great  although a little rushed until we slowed them down a little.  The wine list was not very large  however they had a full spectrum of choices in all varietals. They also have a large cordial list.  The menu is extensive which made our dinner choices difficult. Our appetizers were on point and the waiter was extremely helpful making any last minute decisions. I especially enjoyed the skewered calamari and the crab cake was excellent. The appetizer portions were reasonable and enough for us to share (I would recommend one app per person). I opted for the Bone-in Swordfish and it was excellent. Cooked and seasoned to perfection. The fresh vegetables were also perfectly cooked. I will definitely come back when I am in town so I can check out more of the menu.', ""I was excited to see the groupon for The salt cellar  since it was pretty good last time and seafood is usually expensive. \nMy husband went for a date night and besides the quiet atmosphere and friendly staff  we were not very impressed. \nMy husband's lobster was good  however my king crab legs were fishy tasting and the texture was a little weird. The rice and vegetables had less seasoning than a retirement home. We ordered calamari and it was pretty good  and the bread was decent too. \nI feel bad for the staff that they have to serve\nSuch mediocre food. Even with the groupon it was way too much $ for what we got. I think I'll cook my seafood at home for half the price next time."", ""My hubby is obsessed with crab legs  so every year for his birthday I take him out to places I know he can order them. He is always down for Red Lobster  but ugh I'm not  so I searched for an alternative. We had been to Salt Cellar once before  but that was about 4 years ago  so I thought we should check it out again. I made reservations for Saturday at 8pm  but I let them know we were running 30 minutes late & they said that was totally fine because they were a bit backed up that night. We only had to wait about 10 minutes & our table was ready. The dining room is small  I'd guess there were only about 12 tables in there. We got an awkwardly placed table that faced everyone  & since it was up against a wall we had to sit side by side. It sucked but oh well  we were so late I was glad they still sat us! I do love how this place is underground  but the decor is so boring/dated!\n\nI can't remember our server's name but he was very nice & checked on us often. For starters we got the bucket of steamed mussels with sides of plain butter & butter with herbs. This bucket seemed bottomless  I swear there were at least 50 mussels in there! One thing that bothered me about this app was that it smelled fishy to me  didn't taste fishy though so we didn't get sick  but still. The complimentary bread & whipped butter they brought out was pretty good. Onto our entrees; hubby got the king crab legs (1.5 lbs) & I got the baked stuffed lobster. Both meals came with a salad  veggies & rice or baked potato. They cracked his crab legs & my lobster at the table & then we dug in. Hubs loved his crab  the meat was fresh & sweet. My lobster was ok  the crab  scallops & bread stuffing were too much for me  I would just order a regular lobster in the future. \n\nTotal for one cocktail  an app & 2 entrees was about $130 (not including tip). While the food was pretty good & 4 star worthy  I felt it was overpriced & the place lacked any ambiance  so I think 3 stars is appropriate."", 'Bar service is sooooo slowwwww.........the mixed drinks are terrible...in short the bartenders need retraining.', 'Food was amazing  we had the Halibut and  salmon dish special and the were both good to perfection.

But I have given it several tries and I just can\'t recommend it.  Had one mediocre meal and said   "" we\'ll try again"" . Went for my birthday and it was worse than Long John Silvers  albeit more expensive. Complaining (politely) only garnered more mediocre food along with a poor attitude.  Tonight we thought  Oh  we\'ll just try the bar for happy hour. Scott greeted us and seemed pleasant but Dale actually managed to take our order and deliver it without uttering a word. In fact  I thought he was not going to say a word at all until we left. But he must have overheard me telling my husband that NOTHING ( mussels or any of the mystery dipping sauces they came with ) had ANY flavor. The only thing I noticed was a strong smell of sewer. Anyway   he said "" oh! So Is your stuff any good?""  I said  "" Meh. It\'s ok. but really bland"". At which point he walked away  never to be heard from again. I asked for the check which Scot delivered. The bill was $ 43 and some odd cents and I left $6 and some odd cents. I don\'t care if he thinks I am cheap (former server  good tipper) because I will not return. Everybody says the economy sucks. I think peoples attitudes suck. When we go out to spend our hard earned dollars make it worth our while.', 'This restaurant is actually in a cellar.  The kitchen dishes out straightforward  fresh seafood. For appetizers try Chesapeake Bay crab cakes or oysters.  Try entres such as Idaho trout  Yakimono Hawaiian ahi  or grilled salmon.They also offer a huge 5-pound Maine lobster.', ""Went for my birthday and was so disappointed.  From the weak drinks and the terrible happy hour service  we made our way to the dining room and it didn't get better from there.  The bread arrived at the table it was warm and tempting however  the butter was  well some seafood broth must have creeped into it because it was nasty.  They did bring fresh butter to the table upon request.  I asked for my salad dressing on the side but instead it came to the table  not only on it  but so much of it  it was like Elmer's glue.  The steamed broccoli was terrible and the sauce they put on it was awful similar to the Elmer's glue on the salad and so much of it.  Ickkkkk!   The lobster was over steamed so it was a bit tough but it was sweet.  Needless to say I won't be going back.  Very disappointing."", ""This restaurant was horrible! I went there a few weeks ago with my husband and his parents for my husband's birthday. All of the seafood we had was overcooked: lobster  stuffed shrimp and grouper. I highly doubt that they fly their lobsters in from Maine daily. The vegetables were not fresh or seasonal and the baked potato had no substance. How do you screw up a baked potato??! I think the lighting is so dim because they do not want you to actually see the food on your plate. The dessert  chocolate lava cake  wasn't even good. I grew up on the east coast and love old fashioned seafood restaurants; however  there is no comparison. I couldn't even dent the food on my plate because the thought of eating it made me feel sick. There are too many amazing restaurants in Scottsdale to come here and pay for overpriced  not fresh seafood."", ""I've eaten here twice  food and service was great.

Salad  bread and butter were good. There was four of us and we all ordered different seafood dishes. Stuffed lobster  stuffed shrimp  crispy grouper and halibut. Unfortunately they were all dry/over cooked to some degree. A place that specializes in seafood should know better.

The atmosphere is very romantic and the food is consistently delicious  we celebrate most of our special occasions here because they are so reliable. It is all underground so when you drive up it leaves you to wonder what type of place you are heading to.   When family come out from back east we take them here because the seafood is so fresh.  The staff is top notch and have always been accommodating.  I highly suggest reservations  especially on the weekends  It has a quaint and intimate bar and you can enjoy appetizers there as well.

The happy hour is excellent (half priced oysters - hoooyaa!) The Lobster so fresh and delicious (for AZ). During dinner they have reasonably priced wines (which is nice when you're dropping 40 bucks on a lobster). It also rocks that the place seems so small from above and it is always cool to impress guests that it is underground.. especially in the summer. The only drawback is the dining area seating  it is really cramped  so don't go expecting romantic secluded tables. Other reviewers have noted the high price  but you get what you pay for and where are they finding all this cheap seafood anyways?"", 'Wow!

It's not the same anymore.\n\nWe went for my wife's 30th birthday.  My dad decided to join us.  My wife ordered steak and shrimp  my dad ordered steak  I ordered a crab stuffed lobster.  I have had the crab stuffed lobster many times before.  I was craving it.\n\nWe got our appetizer's.  Dad got snails  wife and I shared steamers.  My dad was happy with the snails.  But then again  how can you go wrong with snails doused in garlic and butter?  The steamers were steamed little neck clams in a garlic broth.  It was not long neck clams like the rest of the world calls steamers.  I wasn't about to argue with the server that these are the wrong clams.\n\nThe food came and for the first time in my life I was asking the server to take back my meal before I even tried it.  It looked dry and over cooked.  I told the server I've had this dish many times before and this is not the way it's supposed to be.  He told me this is what it's supposed to look like and begged me to try it.  I took one bite and I couldn't even swallow it because it was so dry.  Of course the server was gone by this point and didn't come back for 10 minutes to ask me how it was.\n\nWhile I was waiting for the server to return  I told my family I was just going to get the steak.  They just shook their head and told me not to.  I took one bite of my dad's steak and spat it out.  How do you screw up steak this bad?  It tasted like beef jerky and butter.  My dad and wife would have complained too  but it's my wife's birthday and I am already stealing her thunder.  I swapped my meal out for a steamed lobster.  How do you screw up a steamed 1 1/2 lobster?  Fortunately  that came out fine.\n\nSo we left hungry and $300 poorer.  I used to not mind paying the money they charged but now  it is not worth it.  I am really hoping people stop coming here so they can just close down."", 'After my lower review I was promptly contacted by the staff at salt cellar  given an apology and told the best means of resolving issues should something like this happen again. Tell your server promptly  go to the manager quickly. It seems sometimes lobster can have issues beyond the ability of the staff to be aware of until it is actually cracked open. I will give the Salt Cellar another try in the future.', ""I was excited to go to Salt Cellar because I had heard good things... The food was good but nothing worth writing home about.  I ordered the baked stuffed lobster.  There was more of a thin  overcooked layer on top of the lobster than being stuffed... It was so thin and dry that it was hard to taste any of the seafood in the stuffing.  It is served still in the lobster  my personal preference is to be served the lobster as a filet out of it's shell.  Overall  it was rather tough  dry and flavorless.  The sides were unimpressive.  For the price  I believe there are better restaurants to go to."", 'If it wasn\'t for the cool speakeasy style restaurant this would be a 1 star for the value. \n\nLocation and Parking: Great location. Away from the busy streets of old town and mill but close enough to venture there before or after. Plenty of parking.\n\nStyle: This restaurant has a classy speakeasy feel but casual attire is fine. The restaurant is open until 12am and the bar open until 1am. It\'s hard to find someone serving ""upscale"" food  past 10pm so we were excited to check this place out.\n\nNow for the very unfortunate part.\n\nThe food: Wow  just the worst value ever. We ordered Shrimp Cocktail  2 glasses of champagne  market bay scallops and lobster stuffed shrimp. \n\nFirst we got the bread and champagne. Everything was going great. The bread came in huge slices and was fresh. It didn\'t come out warm but it was still fresh and tasty. It was served with a whipped butter. I prefer oil myself but it was good. The champagne was great.\n\nThen we got our shrimp. It had that refrigerator taste to it. Like it was made earlier in the day and then wrapped in plastic and thrown in the fridge. We could both taste it. It wasn\'t the worst shrimp ever and we did eat all 5 jumbo shrimp but we were a little turned off already. \n\nThen we got our salad. We got the house vinaigrette as a dressing. Salad was fine. Lettuce was fresh. It was presented poorly though. I\'m not usually a stickler on presentation but if you\'re charging $40-50 a plate I figured some effort was coming. It looked like a diner salad and for some reason they give you a huge heap of mushrooms on the side. Whatever  salad is a salad. We were still optimistic about this place. It was so cool and classy and close to home that we wanted to love it. Still no real complaints.\n\nThen the dinner came. Ew man. Ew. My Scallops were flavorless. I was expecting big scallops seared and delicious. Instead  I got these miniature flavorless scallops served with a side of broccoli covered in some type of sour cream sauce. And this weird seasoned lemon as a garnish. The presentation was horrendous. It looked like a dish you get from a Mexican restaurant. As soon as we were served we gave each other that  ""what the hell is this"" look.\n\nHer dinner was just as bad. Her stuffed shrimp had shells in it. She literally took one bite and didn\'t want to eat anymore. I tried to eat a few more pieces of the scallops but it was not good. The sides were even worse.\n\nWe dropped $115 plus $20 tip. We frequent nice restaurants and have no problem spending on good food. Check our review history. Take my word for it or be disappointed  the value for this place is simply not there.', 'My husband and I love this place.  My parents met here  so it has special meaning to me.  \n\nThe last time we went  we ordered the HUGE lobster and shared it.  It was a delicious meal  and the server takes all the work out of cracking the lobster.  \n\nShrimp San Remo is the best appetizer  along with the escargot.  \n\nSalt Cellar has one of the best Happy Hours in town as well.

My friend agreed that not only did they have a bit of a sour taste were just ...not good!\n\nThe last thing we ordered was escargot  this dish is for the folks who enjoy butter and ggarlic.....not my taste but I did try one and again.....tasteless other than the garlic    taste... I enjoy the taste of seafood and this dish did not do it for me.\n\nI must reccomend the bread  which is soft and extremely good and I was shocked that they actually charge you for bread when you are spending $50 in food but I will admit I was happy to pay for it.\n\nThe prices are not cheap but again  I do not mind spending money on good food....this was NOT it!\n\nNow on to the ambiance and service.\n\nWhen you enter the restaurant you have to walk down many stairs into restaurant which is underground....very kewl concept unfortunately the moment you walk in you feel like you are in a sauna....very hot and humid ...it overwhelms you....especially when the temps outside are 100 plus......HELLO....THIS IS ARIZONA....USE SOME AIR CONDITIONING!\n\nAs I mentioned earlier Dale was the first bardenter we saw and as efficient as he was I think he left his personality and smile at home...he did not make us feel welcome at all.\n \nOf course its possible there is some other reason he is unfriendly such as he was having a bad day  or he hated his job or......or......or...... nope...no or's.... a bartender should be friendly...

Even if you are busy?\n\nI had asked an employee his name and we were told he has been working there since 1986?  I am thinking its time for Mr personality to get another job.\n\nThis is my opinion of Salt Cellar and it is because of our experience that we will not be returning.\n\nI am sure there are wonderful items on the menu that are delicious but the service and food we did try turned us off.\n\nIt is my opinion if you want to spend a chunk of money on seafood try someplace else.... or not....its your call  but until you do.....\n\nBon Appetite'"", 'Food was great service was at average nothing great. But definitely overpriced!!! Save your money look elsewhere....', 'We celebrated a friend\'s promotion here last night.  If you\'re going to dine here  I would strongly suggest a reservation.  We had one and we still weren\'t seated on time.  \n\nIt\'s a unique experience as it\'s underground.  However  that does make for a pretty crowded space all around.   There seemed to be quite a few people that were there just to hang out in the bar and given the limited space and mild sense of claustrophobia  that is not something I would choose to do.  \n\nThe drinks were done well and they have a great selection of spirits at the bar.  The complimentary bread is tasty but the pieces are huge.  Our crab cake starter might well have been my favorite item.  It\'s super extra crabby and in this case  that is a plus!  \n\nThey have a case with ""live"" lobsters but I suspect these guys had at least one claw in the dish.  (That  or they all have a terrible case of the thorazine shuffle.)  My lobster was prepared well enough but it was fairly chewy.  My steak was delicious but it was prepared medium rare rather than the medium I requested.  (Thankfully  the lighting was low which made it difficult to see the clear evidence of murder on my plate.)  The amaretto cheesecake was tasty and you get a little glass of amaretto with it.  \n\nIt\'s hard for me to balk at prices because they\'re serving fish in the desert.  But know that it\'s going to be a pretty spendy evening.   \n\nGiven that some of our favorite restaurants are just down the road in Old Town  I would probably not choose to come here again.  It was a fun evening and I recommend coming at least once but for me  it won\'t be a repeat experience.', 'Been coming here for years and it is slowly going downhill. Frozen crap. Super disappointed.  No pride left in this restaurant. Very sad. Also sad that I do not see even one response from the owners or management in regards to the many bad reviews .

We got seated in a horrible location with servers walking by every three seconds and a view of the kitchen - we did move after requesting. The server was kind but the drink server was curt. The food was extremely expensive for what it was. The lighting is horrible - you can\'t see anything. One of our dinners was awful (Beef Wellington) - one was okay but small portion and nothing we couldn\'t get at a chain restaurant for A LOT less cash (A few Crab legs for 50-bucks!). If they are going to charge this much $$$$ for food  atmosphere and service they need to bump it up a few notches. Will not go back here and waste my time or my money. Please consider yourself WARNED.', 'I heard about this mystic underground seafood restaurant by chance and I made a mental note of it. My roommate picked up on it when I explained  as best I could  that this place is essentially a parking lot with a restaurant underneath it. And apparently  the seafood is to die for. So when the next special occasion arose (my birthday)  my roommate and I made plans to travel to this netherworld of seafood delicacies and subterranean mystery.\n\nThe experience was better than I could\'ve imagined. First  there was a small crowd waiting for the place to open. Seating is limited  so it can fill up pretty fast. But this added to the adventure feeling  as if we were all on some sort of marine odyssey and we had to gather at the gangplank. We descended into the rustic interior along with the other guests  and then bellied up to the bar to have some appetite-enhancing cocktails before our reservation time. The bar is pretty cool and has a great selection of mixed drinks... I may have to return just for their Happy Hour sometime  and scarf down what looked like a great menu of seafood appetizers.\n\nWhen it was our turn to enter The Abyss  rather  the dining room  we were prepared. We had done our research and watched a clip from the local PBS show ""Check  Please! Arizona"" where the reviewers drooled as they described the sauteed shrimp San Remo appetizer. We had to have it! We made sure to indulge in the fresh baked bread in thick-sliced hunks  perfect for sopping up this most heavenly  buttery  garlicky  tomatoey sauce. This is truly a magnificent  superstar dish that I still dream about (despite the buttery stains that soaked through my napkin onto my dress slacks)! This appetizer is so delicious  that I had no problem eating it AND wearing it.\n\nMy entree was also quite special. I ordered the mahi mahi (with macadamia nuts)  which came with wild rice pilaf and sauteed veggies. I expected this to look like Trout Almondine  with slivered almonds atop. However  the macadamia nuts are actually part of a toothsome  applesauce-like topping which confused me greatly. The sauce definitely has the crushed nuts  but the flavor is a bit sweet and reminiscent of ginger-bread spices. It wasn\'t until I was several bites deep and I squeezed all of my lemon on the fish  that I understand the genius of the flavors. The lemon really opens it up and lets you experience the delicate texture and savory character of the fish accented with gingery and nutty notes from the sauce. Truly a novel approach to what might otherwise be dismissed as just another white fish dish.\n\nAlas  we had a fabulous time at the Salt Cellar. We even got along famously with the couple at the table next to us who were celebrating an anniversary. It seems that the novelty of the underground location and the fabulous food makes for a real treat! I consider my meal here one of my most unique and unforgettable dining experiences.', 'Love love love the crab cakes! Did I mention I love the crab cakes.

We're all looking forward to going back again!"", ""The best seafood in the East Valley. Pacific Club is far more expensive but the quality is the same.

Try the turtle soup  steamed mussels and the raw oysters. The steamed mussels can be eaten without any sauce. It's that tasty. The escargot is nice too. The baked oyster was kind of bland. But you'll have to try it yourself.\n\nThis place is for people that want to be fancy for the night. Eat and drink like an important person. Service is not bad and the food is good.

One of the tables was half way through their meal before the other table received their dinner and we ordered at the same time. When the bill came the staff literally separated each ""beverage"" order (1 coke  3 teas  etc) so they had to redo the ticket. It was time consuming. The food in all honesty was marginal at best.

Very rich  a perfect blend of garlic  butter  portobello mushroom  sun dried tomatoes and who knows what other secret (crack) ingredients. YUM. We couldn't help but dip our bread in the extra sauce. The New England clam chowder was thinner than I've had in the past but full of clams instead of weighed down with endless potatoes-- very tasty. \nWe ordered steak and an ahi tuna special. The steak was large  juicy and steakhouse quality. The ahi was cooked perfectly-- seared and rare in the center with tasty  but not overwhelmingly blackened  spices. They brought a free dessert for my birthday. Despite telling our superior server  Chuck  that we had no room for dessert  he insisted we get it and take it to go. We got a chocolate lava cake type dessert with raspberry and it was rich and super yummy. \nEverything was delicious  the service was over-the-top accommodating and we were so very impressed. If you love seafood and want a unique environment with delicious food and outstanding service  please do not miss out on the chance to try The Salt Cellar."", ""You have to know what you're looking for to find this place.  I've passed this location several dozen times and never realized that a restaurant & bar was located underground.  A friend of mine invited me to have a few drinks and some dinner and I was intrigued  so I decided to go for it.\n\nWe sat at the bar and ordered glasses of Wine and some Oysters.  The bar was packed  but we were able to comfortably enjoy our food and have a conversation.  The food was OK.  The Wine was the house Zinfandel  which was *eh*....but I didn't like the call options  so whatever.....now I know not to order Wine here.\n\nOverall  it wasn't too bad of an experience.  Next time  I'll go with a Beer instead of Wine and try sitting in the dining room.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%"", 'Excellent evening  food and service were amazing! Highly recommended if you are looking for great seafood in the desert!', 'My Mom and I found ourselves in the Scottsdale area and we considering going to a have seafood  when we drove right past the Salt Cellar.   I\'ve lived in AZ since 1971 and never had made it to this restaurant.  Karma was with us on this Friday night  from the moment we drove in the parking lot and got the last spot.  We were greeted with a wonderful lady  later to find out was the owner  and as we told her  ""no  we don\'t have a reservation""  she said that she would see what they could do.  This was a Friday night folks.  They found a nice little table with an atmosphere that only matches the incredible reputation this restaurant has had for years.  The server  Diana  was wonderful and we had the wonderful food and best dining experience.  This is truly a special place.  I will definitely return for a special occasion with the hubby and make sure I make a reservation.', 'I heard a lot about this place before going to it  however  it is nothing like i expected.  I would say the food was average  the service was great  but for the price it is not worth it.  I had better seafood at Wild Fish and Ocean club  for similar price.', ""My boyfriend and I went to the Salt Cellar for our anniversary - we saw a Groupon  checked out reviews on Yelp  and decided it would be a good choice.\n\nWOW  were we wrong!  Going back over the reviews  I'm convinced that no one in AZ actually knows what fresh seafood looks/tastes like.  It certainly can NOT be found at the Salt Cellar.\n\nThe meal started with bread  which was meh.  A seafood place that doesn't serve sourdough?  Odd.  The bread was very plain  even though one slice had olives in it. \n\nFor an appetizer  we chose crab cakes.  They were at least 50% bread crumbs  had a very slightly canned flavor  and came with a very plain tartar sauce.  Pretty mediocre for $15.  They were cooked nicely  however - nice and crisp on the outside - so we finished them. \n\nNext up  salad.  I had Creamy Bleu Cheese and my boyfriend had House.  Again  meh.  The mix was just iceburg lettuce  some carrot shreds  mushrooms  and one cherry tomato.  The house dressing just tasted like vinegar and oil  the bleu cheese was a little musty.\n\nThen the main course... at this point  Boyfriend and I were thinking that the entree would at least be as good as the appetizer  but hoping for much better.  Based on reputation  how could it suck?  Oh... it sucked mightily!\n\nI had Mahi-Mahi sauteed with Macadamia Nuts (a house specialty)  the boyfriend had Salmon Wellington (on their fresh market menu).  \n\nSide dishes were a baked potato that was microwaved and a piece of rubbery  inedible broccoli.\n\nThe salmon was wrapped in spinach  then in puff pastry  kind of like beef wellington  and served with hollandaise. Sounds promising  right?  It was over cooked  mushy  and tasted old.  The hollandaise tasted like plain butter.  Pretty bad  but still a little edible.  Red Lobster-level quality at triple the price.\n\nThe Mahi-Mahi was a disaster!  It was definitely not fresh fish  and actually seemed like it had been cooked hours before I ate it.  It was lukewarm and rubbery  with a pile of candied macadamia's on top.  Even if it had been cooked well  the seasoning and flavor was way too sweet.  After a few terrible  mushy bites  I cut open to the middle - the inside was GRAY and mealy.  DISGUSTING.  I didn't eat any more of it.\n\nIn any decent restaurant  if the server sees that the patron hasn't eaten any of their meal  they'll ask what's wrong and try to make it right.  Our waiter didn't even raise an eyebrow.  Either it's poor service or it happens all the time.\n\nSo  to sum up  for $100 we got two sodas ($8 for those!)  some plain bread  mediocre crab cakes  overcooked old salmon  and pre-cooked possibly near expiration Mahi.  For a meal this quality  save your money and go to Red Lobster.  At least you'll get cheddar bay biscuits!"", 'Fresh Sea Food is what makes a sea food restaurant in the desert.  Salt Cellar has created a science that allows them to have such a unique menu.  If your looking for large lobsters by the lb then you have to check this place out.  I rationalize a heavy purchase of a lobster when I share it with someone and still have more than 2 lbs on my plate.  \n\nThe Salt Cellar is one of the only fine dinning experience that is open late.', ""Decided to stop in recently for happy hour on a Friday. We wanted to do something out of our normal box so we headed to The Salt Cellar (bonus as it's super close to our house) and we got there about 15 minutes to spare before happy hour ended. We found two spots at the side bar but decided that if two seats opened up at the bar we'd take those...well  two opened up and we sat right down. We looked at the menu and quickly ordered so we could still get the happy hour prices. I had 1/2 dozen oysters  escargot  and an oyster shooter  my boyfriend had the clam chowder and shrimp cocktail. We also each ordered a drink. Our bartender Alex was awesome!!!! My oysters came out and they were AMAZING! I cannot wait to go back and get more! My boyfriend really enjoyed his shrimp cocktail as well. Then my escargot came out and it was so garlicy and good!!!! The clam chowder was also very satisfying. We had such a great little dinner and cannot wait to go back. Food was awesome and so was the service!"", ""Love the unique local atmosphere. Have driven by this place for years and finally took the plunge with the motivation of a groupon.\n\nOverall  great service. Staff was very friendly and personable. I had the Alaskan crab legs (my first crab experience) and I thought they were delicious while my bf said they were the best he's ever had. We also ordered the sauteed shrimp appetizer as an entree (comes with pasta  mushrooms  artichoke) and that was absolutely exceptional! Great flavor and portions.\n\nOnly downside is the prices are high but as long as you are prepared for that going in  it's a great place for special occasions or groupons!"", ""Setting: Beautiful wood walls  nicely lit  good dining room. \nFood: The food did not meet my expectations for the price  the quality of seafood is like Red Lobster. The menu seems to have not been updated since the restaurants inception. The chef could easily add some modern flair to it  update the bread (it's literally a Sara Lee dinner roll)  add some variety in the seasoning of fish. The swordfish and halibut were not very flavorful. I know Arizona is landlocked  but I've had better fish in Colorado. Not sure about their meat  but perhaps that's what is best to order. The salad with the tarragon dressing was delicious. \nService: Mediocre  the server seemed to be overworked but she was pleasant. \nDrinks: Good wine selection  this is not a place for craft cocktails\n\nOverall  I will not return there again. There are better options in Arizona for good surf and turf. This place has potential in regards to their menu. I'm honestly surprised how many people recommended this place to me  I was disappointed in the quality."", ""Dined here for the first time  based on a friend's recommendation. Made Saturday night 7:30 reservation for a party of 3. Upon arrival we were greeted and seated right away and were even accommodated to change the table to a different table. Our server Scott  was excellent.\n\nNot sure where all the 4-5 stars are  but this place seems to have missed the boat for us. I should of gotten the clue when I specifically ordered a Cosmo  not too sweet and it came the color of a maraschino cherry and there was a cherry in it. I did not order a Shirley Temple  I ordered a Cosmo.\n\nHaving cocktails while pursuing the menu  we decided on appetizers of the Clam Chowder  1/2 Oysters  and the Crab Cake. Entrees were the New York Strip Steak  Stuffed Shrimp and the Mussels as an entree. Note all entrees are with a Salad  choice of starch  and vegetable. \n\nClam Chowder tasted good but consistency was way off like watery (not creamy and thick). Oysters were a good size served with cocktail sauce  where was the horseradish sauce? (always served hand in hand) and had to ask twice for it. Crab cake was very good but for $18 for 1  the tarter sauce it came with tasted and looked like it came out of a jar. Salad  nothing special  croutons out of a box? The New York Strip was a big cut of meat  cooked perfectly  but little to no seasoning. Stuffed Shrimp looked like it was pre-made  patted down into one pile of mush in the dish and heated up  was just very unappealing. Mussels size and quality were very good  perfectly cooked  but they were just steamed  no seasoning in the steaming so they were flavorless. The 2 options of butter dipping sauces were horrible  no taste in the butter at all and I don't know what the other dipping sauce was  but it was not good.\n\nThe Restaurant is NOT CHEAP $200+ for a party of 3 for what we ordered  by any standards and for the cost it should be much better in taste. It just missed the mark."", ""My husband and I have been here 4 times in the last 2 years and each time it was wonderful.  We have always had great service and the food is divine.  I actually crave the house dressing they have!!!\n\nMy favorite is the crab and scallop stuffed lobster.  It is so tasty!  Love the atmosphere  it's where we go for special dates.  The wait staff cracks your crab legs and lobster for you - that rocks.  At the end of the meal they bring you warmed moist lemon towels to take the sea food smell off of your hands.\n\nThe only negative:  they charge for refills of sodas.  Order water instead."", 'Fantastic experience! Every part of the meal was flavorful  fresh  and cooked perfectly. Possibly the best king crab ever! Service was fantastic including when we made the reservation. We had originally asked for 6:00 and the only time available was 5:00 which we took.

Truly a great night!', ""Savana and Dominick are amazing! By far the best service and experience we've had. It's a must try!"", 'The food was awful  we got shrimp and fillet and oyster combination  it came in a superbig portion  it was terrible  the quality was sooo low.

There are great deals to be had at their happy hour but you have to get there early because they really do fill up  it's a very small bar.\n\nI wasn't a fan of the stuffed oysters. I also didn't care for the littleneck clams but I am not a big clam fan anyway.\n\nBut try the smoked marlin - BEST DISH ON THE MENU. I didn't even want to try it but when I did  it was the most delicious thing there. That's what I keep going back for!"", 'After a heavy dinner  I was craving a dirty martini. The husband and I had wanted to try this place for a while so we decided to grab a drink or two by the bar. The concept is fun - walking down steps into a ""cellar"". The restaurant is not what you expected (in a good way). It\'s dimly lit  cozy  and intimate. I absolutely loved the ambiance! It would be a great place to go on a date or bring a parent for a nice dinner. We grabbed a seat by the bar and ordered our dirty martinis. It was made pretty well. The bartenders seemed pretty busy so it was hard to get anything  but they were always nice when they did serve us. There were a few gentlemen to our side who ordered a slew of appetizers. Everything looked good! It would be a great place to come for happy hour or reverse happy hour and enjoy good seafood.', ""Having been in business for 45 years  they must be doing something right...but unfortunately my expectations were not able to be met. They claim their seafood is flown in from the east coast twice a day so that it's truly fresh and the lobster itself was really tasty it was also a bit rubbery. I had the stake and lobster dinner for $50 which included a good size lobster and a small stake with baked potato and carrots and a salad. The stake just wasn't very good. I don't know how else to say it. I also had Manhattan clam chowder soup for $6 as an appetizer. Now that what excellent! The bread was really good too. I had a $6 Margarita that was OK but it was a very small amount and was gone in about 3 sips. To sum it up  the price of my meal was not justified by the taste and I probably won't be returning any time soon."", 'Quality of this place has def gone downhill over the past year.  When you come here  be prepared for a dingy room w stuck up servers and hosts. Im pretty sure there is only one guy there who rules. He is bald and super friendly and hysterical- may be the only person who cares about his job. The price on the menu says of what management values in their linen white table cloths. Everything is swimming in a pool of butter. The only item that was remotely decent was the shrimp toast. I also did not get any wine suggestions and nobody steered me away from the very dry pinot blanc i was served. Call me crazy  but i didnt want to be lathered in butter and rolled up the stairs on the way out. The carrot cake looked tempting but after half-eating a plate i could recreate as an amateur for half the price i wasnt even going to order it.', ""We finally made it to the Salt Cellar after years of hearing how good it was. We had a groupon  so it made it more attractive for a first try. We were disappointed at the decor--or the lack of it. \nThe waitress could not have been nicer or more helpful  but the food was totally mediocre. We started with Oysters Rockefeller. Tasteless. Salad was drowned in dressing.  I had halibut  'cheeks'  a specialty available only part of the year  for $37. They were delicious  but covered in large capers--totally overpowered the fish. My spouse had haddock--much better. The price of the dinners simply does not justify the quality of the experience. We gave it a 2 out of 10.

Ordered the whole lobster for dinner. Was a little tough  but still tasty.\n\nDownside: A bit smelly!

Overall  not bad but not great either.', 'If you choose to eat here food is VERY good! But MAKE SURE TO CHECK YOUR BILL! They have hand written bills with no break down  and they DO NOT know the pricing in their menu and over charge.', ""For twenty years my husband and I have enjoyed dining at the Salt Cellar  unfortunately the last few visits left us wondering what happened to this once excellent restaurant.Last night was no exception. We planned on having appetizers at the bar but the bartender Daniel was so rude we moved to a table so we could be served by someone who would actually take our order. We typically start with the San\nRemo . Unfortunately the chef must have quit and taken the recipe with him because this was not the San Remo I used to dream about. It tasted like it was swimming in Tabasco sauce  the shrimp were tiny and overcooked. The shrimp\ncocktail was so bad we had to send it back. Even the server said she wasn't sure what the stringy things were hanging off the shrimp???  We should have run for the door at this point but we were starving and couldn't imagine that every item we ordered would be so lackluster and void of flavor. The Salt Cellar is expensive and with all the new restaurants opening that actually care about the quality of food they prepare and offer excellent service we intend to spend our hard earned money elsewhere. Goodbye Salt Cellar it was a good run while it lasted."", ""Went there for dinner. asked for a place that could accommodate a baby in a car seat. The person who took a reservation didn't take note and they jammed us into a booth. No biggie. Was there for my babes 25th birthday. So it would take a lot to mess up the evening. food was great.\nDad complained that the lobster was smoked. So he wasn't overall thrilled with that aspect of the 3.5 lb lobster which coming from massachusettes  he knows what lobster taste is ideal. Tried babes scallops. I never eat scallops  but when she offered. I dug right in. Not sure if they are supposed to be gritty. But i think they needed to be prewashed a lil more.\n\nOther than that everything was great. Ambiance is amazing. I'll be back regardless. Freshest seafood in AZ i'd say besides oceanclub"", ""I've been eating at salt cellar for the past 15 plus years. Shrimp San Remo is my favorite dish. I was sad when they took it off the happy hour menu. Now they've switched bread. They use to have amazing bread. But now they have these dense tasteless rolls. It was a great night when I could go for happy hour and enjoy a beer and dip my bread in my San Remo and savor the goodness. Oh and they use to have the best bartenders. They would greet you with a smile and looked genuinely happy. I realize the service industry is stressful and hard on the feet. I believe my breaking point was reached when I went there on a slow Monday night and the bartender looked perturbed by our presence. I found myself apologizing to him that I had to order another drink and more appetizers. I believe it's the end of an era. Gone are the days of great service and food fit for kings for the older restaurants. They're are several places in Scottsdale that have popped up and are giving the Salt Cellar a run for its money. It makes me sad to see the place go down hill. Many good memories fill the place."", 'Took my Great Grandmother here had a reservation for 4 ended up having another person come along. Had to wait a little longer due to the change in reservation  no big deal. place was uncomfortably hot. Hostesses weren\'t very nice and seemed very unhappy. Started with bread that came from some special bakery the sourdough had no sour tasted like  plain whitebreak if you ask me. We ordered the filet and king crab legs filet tasted like a denny\'s steak  tough  no flavor  had to chew it a lot. Crab was just steamed also no flavor the butter was plain needed garlic or salt or anything for that matter. my grandma had the lobster stuffed with scallops and crab meat  also NO flavor it was all plain again with the plain butter. I was surprised it looked amazing better then the king crab and filet. Last but not least I had the Salmon under thier favorites with the dill topping. It was very small again no flavor the veggies tasted like something out of a frozen bag. Im not being harsh  I\'m serious. The baked potato was probably the best thing on the plate. The appetizer shrimp was good also but that is it. Even though it was not the best experience the waitress was awesome and the environment was cool minus ut being hot.

I was closer to several people sitting at other tables than I was to my own wife which made it difficult to have a conversation.  (2) The food is way overpriced.

Ordered a Mum Napa champagne split at the bar with cocktail server #18  which was wonderful and have had many times.  Before cocktails were done we were shown to our table.  I ordered another Mum Napa split when seated. The dinner server came and was telling us about the menu and chatting with us.  During this process cocktail server #18 brought my champagne and set it down.   After the menu process with our dinner server  I noticed there was not a split bottle next to my glass(it usually fills glass with some left in bottle) but didn\'t think much of it.  I took several sips of my drink and noticed a big difference in taste and not having the bottle I was pretty sure it wasn\'t a Mum Napa but maybe the Prosecco that is also offered.  When cocktail server #18 came by again  I discreetly asked her if this was a Mum.  I did not want to make a scene or anything close to that with business colleagues there. Cocktail server #18 said indiscreetly  ""you saw me pour it  it was a Mum"".  Whether I saw her pour it or not was irrelevant. You do not respond to a customer with a comment like that and a tone of voice like that.  I actually do not remember her pouring it with everything that was going on at that time and maybe I would have if the bottle had been left with remainder of the Mum. After that encounter  cocktail server #18 became pretty condescending.  They did take it off the ticket which they should have because it either wasn\'t a Mum or it was a bad split bottle.

Highly recommended and will be back.', 'My wife and I heard this place was better than another high class restaurant that will go unnamed  from a professional chef.  He claimed the steak was delicious and perfectly cooked.  Also that in addition to the steak  at the Salt Cellar you get two sides.  So ""you get better value  and better tasting food for the same price!""\n\nI like a good steak.  I picked the ribeye (one of my most favorite cuts)  and waiting in anxious anticipation.  I had high expectations and was very excited.  My wife ordered the stuffed lobster  and we waited.  The atmosphere was nice.  The furniture could use updating  but everything was clean.  Our waiter was very nice and helpful.\n\nWhen the food came it looked wonderful.  However  the steak was tough.  It tasted good  but it was very chewy.  While it looked to be cooked to my liking  I expected it to be easier to chew and swallow.\n\nMy wife was very pleased with her lobster.  She raved over it  and would probably give a 4-5 star review.  The service was the redeeming factor for the Salt Cellar.  But for that you\'d be looking at 1-2 stars.', 'Went for appetizers with my 88 year old dad and 10 year old granddaughter. Clams on half shell delicious and fresh. Only downfall  prices are very high.', ""Really just isn't good. Used to be one of the better seafood places around town but the 2 times I've been forced to come here in the past 3 years its been awful. \n\nThe only reason I go is because my 85 year old grandfather with dying taste buds remembers how good this place was 10 years ago and he still thinks he likes it. \n\nOrder the lobster or order the crab and I swear to god it's been dead for a week. The best place to get 25 dollars worth of food for 150 bucks."", 'During a birthday celebration we were turned down after 4 drinks. Garbage. Go somewhere else if you want to have fun', 'We had been wanting to try the Salt Cellar for years  having heard good word of mouth and mostly positive reviews.  We wanted to like it.  We really really did  but our experience was less than stellar.  We started in the bar for happy hour.  This was  for the most part  the highlight of our evening.  The happy hour food is reasonably priced.  The same can\'t be said for the tiny overpriced drinks.  Obviously what you save in food cost is made up on the drinks.  We had raw oysters  raw clam  halibut ceviche  and the shrimp san remo  which is a signature dish of the Salt Cellar.  the oysters  at $1.50 each  were a bargain.  Plump  briny and with just enough ""chew"" to give them substance.  Served with an average cocktail sauce and lemon wedges  it seemed we were off to a good start.  Same for the ceviche (I believe it was about $8.00).  Bathed in a flavorful lime juice  the moist fresh chopped halibut was ensconced in a bed of chopped onion tomato and herbs.  Again  delicious and refreshing.  Just \'ok\' was the Shrimp San Remo (about $12.00).  Eight medium shrimp in a spicy sauce which also included portabello mushroom pieces.  While tasty with just enough spice to keep it interesting  the sauce was a bit overly oily.  Our waitress brought us a basket of bread and the oiliness didn\'t stop us from sopping up the tasty sauce.  Although my stomach did not appreciate the grease later!  Now the bad.  The clams ($1.50 each) had gone south.  They had a rancidness to them that was very off putting. We brought it to our waitress\' attention and she offered to exchange them for oysters  which was ok  but when we got our bill  we had been charged for the extra oysters.  Not a huge deal  but when you drop almost $90.00 just for happy hour  it would have been nice if the oysters had been comped or at least offer to buy us a drink. \n\nOn to the dining room.  First  the whole restaurant is in need of a major decor remodel.  Not saying change the charming theme  but get the mustiness out and update the upholstery  carpet and tacky pictures on the walls.  Just freshen it a bit.  then whole decor harkened back to those rotten clams.\n\nThe wait staff is professional enough  nothing particularly outstanding  but capable and attentive without being a perpetual shadow.\n\nI ordered the scallops in crab/shrimp cream sauce (about $35.00)and my date ordered the stuffed lobster (about $45.00).  Both came with an average mixed dinner salad and a bread basket.  When my dish came  I was a little surprised  to see that there was no accompaniment  just the n\\entree.  No veggie  which would have been fine if the dish wasn\'t so miserly on the scallops.  Only four lonely  medium sized scallops floating in a soupy pink ""sauce"".  The sauce had a faint taste of fishy cream and little other flavor. It had shreds of crab meat that seemed out of a can and those tiny little shrimp that have no flavor whatsoever.  The scallops were overcooked so they were rubbery.   The aforementioned cream sauce added nothing to the dish and the mound of white rice in the middle of it all only served as a reminder as to the minuteness of the actual seafood in this dish.  Not at all a bargain for the cost.\n\nMy companions dish didn\'t fare much better.  The lobster was decent size but grossly over cooked.  The soggy vegetable accompanying it had no flavor  and the stuffing was dry and flavorless as well.  There was a nice surprise of about three scallops in the stuffing.  Perhaps they had crawled off my dish to keep warm  which would account for the amount I received.  She also elected the lemon rice.  Perhaps a bloodhound could detect a faint whiff of  lemon  but we sure couldn\'t.  \n\nThe Salt Cellar clientele seem to be a bit on the older side  which might account for the lack of seasonings  or perhaps they think the seafood can speak for itself. Well  if the seafood was fresher and cooked properly  perhaps that would be ok.  But given the circumstances  it NEEDED A FLAVOR INJECTION!\n\nIf this were a medium or lower priced seafood restaurant  I could give them a pass  but I dropped over $240.00 between the happy hour  dinner and tips and in no way was what we were served worth that.  they charge high-end restaurant  premium seafood prices but deliver sub-par food and just ok service.  It\'s apparent that there are quite a few people that like this place and are repeat customers.  We won\'t be counted amongst them  although we might consider coming again for happy hour', ""Anytime I'm in AZ my family eats at the Salt Cellar. Hands down the best in Thea valley by far! Not to be missed:)"", 'Ordered wine for $13/glass.  Asked them to make sure it wasn\'t old.  They assured me it wasn\'t.  I told them I would know right away.  Sure enough  $13 wine tasted like rubbing alcohol and was ""corked.""  Sent it back.  They opened new bottle.  New bottle was fine.  \nThen ordered $16 crab cakes.  They were frozen and fried. Doubt they were even crab.  Isn\'t this a seafood restaurant? They tasted like frozen fish sticks.  A $16 crab cake at a seafood restaurant should be like they are at other places  lump crab meat  not fried on both sides.  I\'m so done with this place.  I only gave it 2 stars because my friend ordered oysters and said they were good.', 'Passed it up because of how small it is and had to circle back.\nWalk through the front door and head to the underground.\n\nstarted with the san remo shrimp and escargot appetizers. \nThe shrimp was good but probably wouldnt order it again.. Tried escargot for the very first time and thought it would be something i would never try but it was pretty good  might order that one again. \nordered the beef wellington for my main dish and didnt enjoy it  the meat itself was good. when we placed our order the waiter was a prick. he misspoke about the sides and we questioned what he said and then he said it correctly and was saying he didnt say that  we just started laughing because we all heard it and i think that made him more mad. so 1 star because of the waiter  probably only a 2.5-3 stars if he didnt act like this.', 'Very cool place  great wine selection  great seafood a little pricey but you get what you pay for and here the fish is fresh and flown in everyday.....we all know that once you get past the smell not everything is eatable......just sayn  so you ask why only three stars......bottom line  my fish came out cold', ""Happy hour is great if that is just what you are going for.

We just dropped in without reservations so we waited in the bar until a table was available and let me tell you the bartending staff is great and the drinks are what they should be. When we got our table Kara was our waitress and she is probably the best server I have ever had. She quickly assessed what our tastes were and recommended meals. I love blackened dishes but hate it when a place can\'t do it right so I was skeptical when she recommended the blackened ahi tuna. Kara stated with no delay that not only would I be happy with it but to ""just close the menu now  you won\'t be disappointed"" !!! Boy was she right! I am a definite ""foodie"" and I love to eat out and I can\'t remember when I last enjoyed a meal this much.

Everything was done perfectly and we both really loved what we got. Especially mine. They stuffed it with scallops  crab  and of course stuffing. I love that its underground.

We also had the scallops and they were good.\nBut the highlight of the meal was without a doubt the Shrimp San Remo...large shrimp in olive oil  garlic  sundried tomatoes...bread to dip into the delicious concoction...simply amazing. \nOne thing to note  Salt Cellar is not cheap...average plate is roughly $30-40...so not a cheap nite out.

If you get lobster or crab from them  the waitress will crack and de-shell it for you; it's such a great service since a lot of the time I am hesitant to get any kind of crustacean because I don't like getting messy and spending all that time getting the meat out of the shell.  The lobster here  while technically from Maine  is flown in fresh from Boston  and they offer 1.25 lb  3 lb  and occasionally a showcase jumbo lobster.  When I went here they were touting an 8 lb lobster for those with the stomach (and coin) to spend a pretty penny on the Yao Ming of lobsters.\n\nWhile the sides are very basic  the seafood is understandably the real star of the show.  While I was happy with my fresh lobster  I did try some salmon wellington  which was some of the best tasting salmon I've had in some time.  It was very tender and moist  and very fresh.  I'm also happy to report that they have soft shell crabs here this season  which is one of my favorite seafood items.\n\nThe ambiance itself  for me at least  is a bit lacking.  They don't call it the Salt Cellar for nothing  for when you descend into the restaurant through a flight of stairs  it's very dark and a bit damp and chilly.

I remember eating here years and years ago  and it seems like they haven't changed anything about the decor since then!"", 'Probably would not eat here again. Very old school customer base. The calamari tasted like ammonia for some reason. The dipping sauce with my lobster was ponzu and the breading was funky. Nothing flavorful and under salted food over salted crab water.

The first time my party ordered the surf and turf for each person. Ultimately  the seafood (crab cakes for an appetizer and lobster tail with the meal) were decent - nothing special though as someone who comes from a place where fresh seafood is abundant. As for the filet mignon  it tasted as if someone had basted it in maple syrup. For the prices  I expected the steak to be at least edible (everyone left it on their plates practically untouched after the first bite). The desserts were excellent though  so we took a chance and returned for a birthday this evening planning on sticking to just seafood and desserts.\n\nUnfortunately  we never even made it to our table. The staff made an error and didn\'t put us in line to be seated  which was an error I would have been more than willing to overlook despite waiting almost thirty minutes past our reservation time. People make mistakes. No big deal. My issue came with their handling of the matter though. After speaking with the hostess we continued to wait  never saw a manager or anyone come over to say so much as ""sorry for the wait - can we get you anything while we clear your table?""  and the only time they even appeared to feel badly was when we left and took our money with us. The single exception to this was the bartender who saw us waiting and chose to comp our sodas before we left  and if anyone at your establishment reads this review please know that your bartender is about the only good thing we experienced while there this evening. I\'ve never gotten such an impression from a restaurant that I\'m literally just a dollar sign and an inconvenience otherwise. If I\'m paying $200 for two people to eat  I expect a little more decency from the people running the place than what was evident this evening (sans the excellent bartender). I will not go back and will recommend my friends and family also not bother wasting their time and money there after experiencing both bad food and now similar service.', ""Salt Cellar is a hidden gem for the Valley locals.

The restaurant was cozy and romantic with an old nostalgic charm. Our waiter rocked and was very quick to refill our drinks and bring our appetizer and meals. He was very friendly and knowing that we were first timers  he explained the menu and was highly informative. We ordered the Shrimp San Remo for appetizer which we probably would not order again. The sauce was flavorful and tasty  however  the shrimp was overcooked. Also  both of us were not happy campers later in the evening and we believe it was because of this appetizer. However  everything else was terrific. For entrées  I opted for the baked stuffed lobster with baked potato and vegi  and the hubby ordered some kind of sauteed scallop special with mushrooms  baked potato  and vegi. Everything tasted fabulous and we were stuffed. One additional note: I love that the waiter offers to crack the lobster crab for you. At the end of our meal when we thought we couldn't eat another bite  our waiter brought us a complimentary slice of snickers cheesecake because it was our anniversary. It was such a nice gesture and I will not lie  the cheesecake was amazing and really did taste like a snickers bar. So in all  this place was very good and a great option for a special occasion. My only complaints were the appetizer (I don't enjoy overcooked shrimp or being in the bathroom for an hour) and I wished the bread they served was warm (seemed like store bought cold bread). One other little side-note: If you hate seafood  this is probably not the place for you. I am not saying this because the menu has a majority of seafood  as you can still find steaks and other non seafood items  but because upon entering the restaurant  you are instantly greeted with the aroma of fish and other seafood. This could be a bit offputting for some. After a few minutes though  you get used to it if you don't mind the smell of seafood. Some people might not be able to get over it and it could be somewhat unpleasant.

She came back and politely told me that the manager said they just can't do a party like that on a weekend. Welp... That's pretty crummy.

Everyone had mounds of carrots on their plates.  (I'm guessing that this is not their normal style.)\nThe graduate had the lobster stuffed with shrimp and scallops to celebrate and she demolished it.  Another in our party had the halibut which he called delicious.  And another had sautéed scallops.  (I believe they were in a butter and shery sauce.)  \nThe service was excellent.  \nWe really had a nice time and would highly recommend this restaurant  both for the food and for the experience."", ""This was our first time to this restaurant. I could go either 3 or 4 stars and I chose 3. First our party was seated upon arrival. Service was first rate and the food was very good and the portions generous. Why 3 stars? Because the prices are outrageous. For a party of three each with one drink  appetizer and main course and the price was $188! We did not have high end drinks  lobster  crab or anything that you might expect to drive up the cost. We had crab cakes  scallops and halibut.\n\nI've been to many very good places and while the experience was very nice  their prices are way too high."", 'Had the best meal I have had in years.    The seafood was all fresh.   The oysters were fresh and large.    Everything we had was amazing.   The service was perfect.   Shelly was amazing.

I believe you\'re supposed to have a reservation  but we just walked on in and asked if we could be seated.\n\nSeating was a little strange but we got over it. The place is strange in general  so if you\'re looking for ""normal"" you should probably save this for a later date. We sat in a tiny room with another family on the opposite end. The lighting is very dim and romantic  and the entire feel is very ""couple-sy""  so you should probably steer clear if you\'re going through a breakup.\n\nOur server was a straight up Lobster connoisseur. She broke that puppy into beautiful savory little pieces in seconds flat  leaving us with the shell in tact (probably so that we could revel in how much better she was able to do it than we ever would have been  which we did).\n\nWe went all out and had the full course meal  complete with paired glasses of wine. It was quite the pricey treat  but it was worth it.\n\nNoteworthy appetizer: The oysters are absolutely heavenly. I have only ever eaten oysters previously at Casey Moores Oyster House  so it was nice to be able to try them somewhere else... but there was no comparison  Salt Cellar\'s oysters far exceeded my expectations.\n\nExpect to pay well over $100 for two  my fellow cheapskates!', 'If you are handicapped  DO NOT GO HERE!!!

DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!', ""Great place to eat seafood  now i'm from Alexandria  Egypt on the meditteranean born and raised  so sea food is in my blood  i was very impressed with this place  the rockefeller oysters were great  and the atmosphere is very cool.\n\nThe place is a bit loud and busy but that just adds to the experience!"", ""Came to this wonderful little gem the night of my birthday. We started with a couple of brandy old fashions  oysters  and marlin for appetizers and everything was delicious. For our meals we both had the main lobster and added on a sirloin steak. Came with baked potato  veggies  and rolls if you like. The food was spot on  we also had a bottle of the white wine that paired wonderful with the lobster.\nThe staff was so kind and very knowledgeable on the menu/wine selection. Our server must have looked at our notes because at the end of the night he brought out a birthday dessert without us saying anything. It's such a quiet  friendly  and romantic restaurant. I can't wait to go back!"", ""I would say this is definitely the best seafood I have had in AZ so far.  \n\nReally great food and great decor as well.  You pull up and wonder if you are in the right place but then you enter and go downstairs and see that the entire place is underground.  It all looks and feels like the inside of a ship and its surprisingly a very nice feeling.\n\nWe had the crab cakes for an appetizer and then the stuffed lobster and the king crab legs.  Everything was very good.  \n\nCrab Cakes -\nThey were great.  Not huge but great.  Almost no breading so tons of crab and a very nice dipping sauce that I can't recall.\n\nStuffed Lobster -\nNicely sized lobster with all of the meat intact (sometimes I feel that places replace some of the meat with the stuffing to use the meat elsewhere).  The stuffing was very good but seemed like a lot of breading.  Very nice dish though.\n\nKing Crab Legs -\nThese were great.  Very fresh.  No saltiness  fishiness  or hint of freezer burn that you get many times with king crab legs.  Quite a nice touch that the waitress cracks all of the shells for you tableside and even leaves all the kunckle meat easily accessible.  All the legs were an ok size but not huge.  They were cooked perfectly though.\n\nOverall I would say great seafood and a menu with tons of variety and fresh items.  It was a little over priced though.  Pretty much every dish was at least $30 and most were high $30s.  Not obnoxiously expensive but a little much."", 'Absolutely delicious and service was excellent!! Had sautéed lobster over grits and that San Remo Shrimp appetizer and the Clam Chowder were great as well. Paired with a great Chardonnay and would greatly recommend to friends. Very cozy and intimate atmosphere. A great place for a special occasion !!', ""A friend recently took me to dinner here for my birthday. I was very excited since I previewed the menu online and other's I had spoken with about the restaurant seemed to be satisfied customers.\n\nThe service was great. The wait staff was attentive. My friend ordered the Shrimp San Remos (which seems to be a hit with others that have written a review) for the both of us. It was great.\n\nMy friend ordered a lobster and I ordered a stuffed (crab & scallops) lobster. Her lobster was fine. But my lobster had the not so faint smell of ammonia. We even compared lobster smells and she agreed that my dish smelled of ammonia. I didn't say anything to anybody else and I ate most of my meal. It didn't dawn on me until the next day to look online and see why my lobster smelled of ammonia. Well  apparently this is what happens when the lobster isn't frozen or prepared in a timely manner after harvest or death. Although the quality of meat has deteriorated  it doesn't necessarily mean you will get food poisoning. Which I did not thankfully. Anyway  it was more disappointing than anything since it was my first time there and I expected a little bit better fare. \n\nI probably set myself up for failure since it was the middle of the week  an hour and a half before closing and people were just trying to go home. I thought they dealt with fresh seafood... Anyway  just a disappointment.\n\nNext time it will be an easier decision with Pappadeux's right around the corner from me."", 'Have gone here a few times in the last 6 months  and every time was wonderful! Staff is very helpful and the food is great!', ""The food was good. Server was rude. She seemed annoyed to have to wait on us. The male server waiting on the table next to us seemed great. Wish we'd had him. Won't be back."", ""We came here for the  crab cakes. Fair to midland. Shredded the crab way too much. Had the shrimp scampi which was over cooked. Salad was drenched in dressing and the Ceviche was FULL of capers and the Halibut that was part of the Ceviche. Service was impeccable which saves the meal. I am not sure why this restaurant is still in business - maybe it's the only fair restaurant in South Scottsdale. The customer next to us had the lobster and was also big time disappointed."", ""I really love this place  for three reasons:\n\n1) That nearly the entire restaurant is underground is really cool. There's something retro about that  though the place itself does feel modern.\n\n2) It's romantic  mostly because there are no windows and so it has very low light. It isn't noisy either - everyone there (when I went anyway) seemed to understand that the mood was low key.\n\n3) The lobster is actually fresh. They did what they had to do to get fresh lobster to the restaurant the day I showed up to eat it. You do pay for that kind of freshness of course  but please believe me - this is ALWAYS better than eating rubbery  whiffy lobster. If you're going to eat lobster without leaving town  pay the extra for it or stay home.\n\nIt is a fabulous date restaurant. SO LEAVE YOUR KIDS AT HOME. The darkness and closed in feeling didn't work with the one that was there when I was  which was the one downside - a downside the restaurant had nothing to do with  of course.\n\nOtherwise  perfect."", ""Growing up on the East coast makes you yearn for seafood.  I don't count Red Lobster as serious seafood  so when I heard about this place I dragged my family along to try.  The place is wonderful!  I had shrimp cocktail (watch out for the cocktail sauce  it's REALLY spicy  but if you like spicy it's also really good!).  I also had the lobster which the server nicely cracked for me so I didn't have to do any of the work.  The food was great  it was reasonably priced  everyone at the table enjoyed their meals.  We'd definitely go back again!  Be careful when searching this place out though  you may go so fast you'll miss it!"", ""We've eaten here every year for the past ten years.  This year was such a disappointment.  Made the reservation 6 days in advance.  Told them we were celebrating an anniversary - 40 years! Got a call the morning of the reservation to reconfirm.  We arrived right on time for our reservation.  Had to wait 15 minutes for our table.  Once seated  the service was very slow.  It was 40 minutes from the time of the reservation before we had the first sip of wine.  The food was great.  Had the ahi tuna.  The end of the meal  no mention of it being our anniversary.  Needless to say we won't be back.  When looking for a special restaurant for a special occasion  we'll look elsewhere!"", ""Living near South Scottsdale  I'm delighted to have such a nice restaurant so close to home! I really had no idea the extent of this place before I came here for the first time with fellow  famed (Tampa) yelper Steve E. The Salt Cellar is  literally  located in a cellar underground and has been an area staple for almost 40 years. They have mostly seafood as well as steak  and the food and service are excellent. On my first visit I had the ahi tuna with couscous  which was amazing  and there was enough left to snack on the next day. Good choice Steve!\n\nI recently returned with my boyfriend for his 28th birthday celebration. As expected  the food was astoundingly good - this time  ahi and crabcakes - and the service was top-notch. They comped our dessert (the chocolate and caramel gelato  a repeat for me) which was much appreciated.\n\nThis is a great option for an upscale date or business dinner. Make sure you get a reservation and give yourself some time to enjoy everything. You won't be disappointed here. I'll be back!"", ""I've never had a bad meal here...

Thanks JJ"", ""After walking around Scottsdale for hours shopping  we googled seafood in the area and this is the location that was recommended.  So we tried it  I have to say that the wine list was exceptional and that my friends is where the story turned.  I ordered the stuff lobster and though the inside crab stuffing was good  the lobster was chewy and rubber.  My partner ordered a steak and it was a bit cold.  The broccoli thing that came with our dinner was a little weird  it was just a whole Broccoli with some cheese over it  not much chef imagination there.  I was very disappointed  come on we spend $130 for dinner and left with a bad taste in our mouth about this place.  On the ride home I kept thinking to myself  man I could have bought a week's worth of groceries and made better dinners then what we got there..

The seafood was definitely quite fresh though. I do have to compliment their scallops. I did not have them but tasted my husband's and he was quite happy with them.

I had gone to Sees Candy to pick up some chocolates for my husband earlier in the day and I asked the employees there what they recommended.  Both of them highly recommended the Salt Cellar.\n\nTHE ENTIRE RESTAURANT IS UNDERGROUND.  We walked down three short flights of stairs to an atmosphere that was very inviting.  The HOSTESS greeted us with a smile.  The SERVICE was excellent.   Our WAITRESS was very attentive but not overly attentive.  Another one of the staff kept our water  wine and soft drinks flowing.\n\nThe FOOD was excellent.  The bread was delicious  especially when we dipped it in the sauce from our SHRIMP SAN REMO APPETIZER which tasted like nothing I ever had before and was one of the best tasting dishes I have ever had.  I will definitely order that again.\nI had the BLACKENED HALIBUT which was the biggest piece I have ever been served in my life and it was cooked perfecly and the tasted delicious.  The baked potato was also very good.  The BROCOLLI with a touch of cheese sauce was amazing!  My daughter had the KING CRAB LEGs which were cracked open tableside by the waitress.  My daughter said some of the pieces were really good and some were just ok.  For $55 I expected them to all be delicious.  I enjoyed the bite I tried  which was very lobster like to me.   My husband had the SAUTEED SCALLOPS with mushrooms which was absolutely DELICIOUS.  \n\nOUR DESSERT was the BOURBON CHEESECAKE which the server gave to us on the house since it was our anniversary.  Nice touch.  It was delicious!\n\nWe are all looking forward to going back and trying more entrees and we will definitely order the SHRIMP SAN REMO again if it's available!"", ""First time visit Saturday night.  It was everything it was hyped about!

I'm basing this on the main entrees and pricing. The appetizers were delicious and the service was exceptional. That could have been due to the fact that the place was pretty dead for a Friday night.. But nevertheless our server  I think her name was Destiny(?) She was very very good and recommended we try the Sauteed shrimp San Remo  SO GOOD!. We also got a bucket of steamed clams and some calamari. \nMy main issue was with the average tasting  overly priced entrees. My food was tasty  I got the Scallops with King crab & Atlantic Baby Shrimp sauce. Our server gave an excellent description of what to expect when the food came and I'm glad she did because what I got was not what I expected  but like I said  it was OK. My boyfriend and his sister were not particularly please with their entree choices either. \nI think the moral of the story is  unless you have a TON of money to drop on lobster (I'm guessing that's what they're known for) just go to enjoy the ambiance  have some wine and appetizers. You will still have a pretty heavy ticket at the end of the night but it will be a much better experience."", ""My husband and I used to come here on dates in the 70's so decided it would be fun to come here for our anniversary. I had the crab legs and they were so sweet and wonderful. I will never go to Salt Cellar and not order these!!!  My husband had the blackened halibut and was very happy with his meal.   Our server was excellent as well. Highly recommend getting reservations."", 'This was the second time here while visiting Phoenix. The salmon was excellent and the service was outstanding. I will be back.', ""I have been to the Salt Cellar a few times before for happy hour but decided to come in for a nice sit down dinner with a friend and have the full experience. \n\nWhen we walked down the stairs we were immediately greeted by the hostess who was very nice . Since we were a little early for our reservation  she suggested that we sit at the bar for a cocktail and appetizer since it was still happy hour. \n\nOur cocktail server was very polite and promptly took our drink orders.  We decided to have the oysters on the half shell which were just delicious.  We sat at the bar with our drinks and appetizer for about 30 minutes when our server introduced herself and showed us to our table. We were able to transfer our tab from the bar to our table. We of course tipped our cocktail server because she took such good care of us.\n\nOnce at our table  our server went over the menu. We decided to order a bottle of wine because we were there for the whole experience.  She brought us and poured our wine and preceeded to tell us about the menu. One of the appetizers on the menu I have never tried before so we decided to order it. The oysters rockefeller   oh my goodness  it was heaven in my mouth. I would go back just to eat 3 or 4 orders of it for dinner! I finally decided on having the stuffed crab for dinner.  My friend chose the scallops (which I have had before and they melt in your mouth). \n\nLet me tell you about the lobster I had. It was stuffed with crab meat and scallops and I couldn't get enough of it! It was so good! Our server took the time to crack  the claws and I'm so glad she did because the meat inside of those claws was phenomenal.  It was fresh and cooked to perfection.\n\nAfter the amazing dinner we had just experienced  our server asked if we were ready for desert. Now  I couldn't eat one more bite because I had consumed about 2 pounds of amazing  fresh and perfectly cooked food. She suggested after dinner drinks. Heck yeah! More drinks? Why not? So she and another server suggested a drink called Nuts and Berries. My friend and I decided that we would have that. Holy cow! It was probably the most amazing after dinner drink I ever had! I would love to know how you make it. \n\nAll in all i recommend this place to everyone. Between the fresh food  the intimate atmosphere and the wonderful and caring staff  I will definitely be back. The happy hour is amazing  the service is amazing and the food is amazing. Thank you Salt Cellar for an wonderful dining experience! I'll be back :)"", ""This was such a great meal! I went with my best friend who also loves seafood. We had the half dozen oysters on the half shell and the turtle soup to start. The raw oysters are an old favorite  while the turtle soup is definitely a new one. It was served with a slice of lime and a shot of cooking sherry to be added to taste. The mixed basket of bread on the table was perfect for dipping into the dark flavorful soup (my favorite was the olive bread)  and the soup was gone quickly. The turtle meat had been completely removed from the turtle and shredded. It had the consistency of shredded pork  but just a little different. If you've never had it  I highly recommend trying it.  Not only because it's delicious  but because it's always good to step out of your food comfort zone  especially for something so tasty. I promise you will be licking the little bits of turtle meat off of the spoon :-)\n For the main courses we ordered the swordfish with mango salsa and the pound and a half of king crab legs. The mango salsa was a great contrast to the seared swordfish. It was also perfectly cooked and not too dry  which  in my limited experience  seems to be difficult with swordfish.  The swordfish also came with a salad  steamed veggies and either a baked potato or rice.  Now to finish this off with the best part: the crab legs were amazing! The server asked us if we wanted him to crack them and after saying yes  he dazzled us with his wicked awesome crab leg cracking skills. Every piece was ready to be eaten  and only very little use of the very small fork given  was needed.  On a side note  king crab is the way to go if you have the choice. the smaller opilio crab doesn't ever really give you a good sized bite of crab  but king crab is all big juicy bites of meaty crab goodness. \nThe Salt Cellar was a dimly lit cozy environment.  The walk down the stairs into the cellar should have been a warning that we were going to have to climb out of there  which may have limited out excessive food intake :-) there was a cocktail lounge if you just want to have a beverage  and two dining rooms which have great beach and ocean landscape pictures on the walls.  The staff was very friendly  and so were the live lobsters in the giant tank as you walk in. This is a great place to take a friend or a rather impressive place for a first date.  Just make sure that he/she likes seafood."", ""HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! I have been there several times over the last 20 years and always had a delightful seafood dinner.

And what???? no elevator ??? to go down into this underground establishment??? they had handicap parking  but no handicap access !! Isn 't that a law ? ADA? They kindly offered two strong young men to help haul em up...  We were all shaken up and worried by the time we sat down  how the hell were we going to get up those stairs?  My Dad was looking forward to King Crab Legs... they were $50! He went for a steak. We all ordered oysters  and in two dozen got 3 bad ones. ugh! ever had a bad oyster? It's almost enough to cure you... I know  what do you expect in the desert when ordering seafood??  I don't know... Maybe a fair price for fresh food???

It's also wild expensive  but it's certainly worth it to me  I love dining in strange locales and soaking up some history. \n\nWhat you really want to see here is the architecture  and the service.

It is not handicap accessible. No ramps or elevators which they state on their website due to the building's structure. We went for happy hour followed by dinner. The happy hour bar is small and dark. It wasn't as cool down there as I expected. The bar areas were warm. I asked to have the ceiling fans turned on only to be informed that they would pull more warm air down. The restaurant section was very well cooled. The bar was very crowded. We sat at the bar as you enter the restaurant. Both had happy hour. The hostess and servers were friendly and helpful. If you go for happy hour be there when the doors open for a good seat. We enjoyed our bar appetizers more than our meals. The shrimp toast was tasty. The crab cakes were excellent. I would go back for them. My husband said he enjoyed his bucket of clams. The Georges Bank scallops were okay. I think they needed more flavor. My husband had the blackened halibut. I had grouper. Neither of us were overly impressed with our dinner entrees. The salad was delicious. There were pros and cons. Considering the prices we expected more flavorful  memorable food and stronger cocktails. It's something different that we are glad to say we tried. I would definitely go back for the crab cakes and maybe to try their lobster."", ""Tonight was my first time here. I heard great things about this place. Walking down 3 flights of stairs to a wooden decorated underground restaurant made me feel like I was on a ship. I surely thought I was going to enjoy some of the best seafood. But we are no where near an ocean and maybe I had too high of expectations. I had the swordfish and it was the first time in my life I had ever not liked sword fish. I took it home and fed it to my dog. The sides were bland with no taste. The oysters were alright but didn't come with lemon or oyster forks and seemed a little old. The service was some of the worst I have ever had in my life. The staff seemed like they didn't like their jobs even management. This place could be a hidden gem if they hired all new staff/ management."", ""I have not made it to the dining room yet.

My husband made reservations for us online for dinner for my birthday.

I will no longer listen to rumors about how Arizona doesn't have any good seafood."", 'When we got there 20 minutes early and found there was no parking  I had to drive around the block to look for an available spot on the street.     When I mentioned this to the receptionist  I was informed  by a snotty know-it-all receptionist with non-existent customer service ""skills"" that there was ""plenty"" of parking in the lot  on the side  in the back....   We considered leaving right then and there  and wish we had.  People like this DO NOT belong as a first impression representative.  STRIKE 1\n\nHowever  I\'ve wanted to try this place for some time so we stayed.   We were given an abundance of bread and it did not take long to figure out why.  They fill you up with bread  so that you won\'t notice the ""couldn\'t care less"" waiters  forthcoming small portions and terrible food.\n\nI ordered the Beef Wellington.  It was small  raw and tasteless.   I did not know it was possible to make a bad Beef Wellington  but the Salt Cellars have this failure down to perfection.  STRIKE 2\n\nI asked for blue cheese  and the waiter told me they did not have blue cheese  but a tarragon dressing that was close to blue cheese.  I decided to try that dressing since I was given no other options.   The dressing was ok  but I would not order it again and while I was eating my salad  the table next to us was ordering and  unlike with us  the same waiter explained each and every salad dressing choice on the list  which including Roquefort.   I love Roquefort.   And for this waiter to suggest tarragon as a close replacement for blue cheese when Roquefort is available  tells me that the waiter doesn\'t even have a clue about the food he\'s suggesting. STRIKE 3\n\nMy wife had the small lobster tail and something that resembled a filet mignon.   The lobster was very chewy and rubbery with no flavor.  The filet was something totally different and unacceptable.  It was flavorless  and so tough you could have used it for shoe leather.   I have no idea how anyone could do this to a ""filet""  unless  as I suspect  it wasn\'t even a filet to begin with.   She brought it home  and attempted to finish it today  but could only saw through a couple of bites.  The remaining carcass was disposed of in the trash where it belongs.   STRIKE 4\n\nWhile the inconsiderate waiter showed the desert tray to everyone else  he simply brought our bill.  We both though this was incredibly rude and don\'t understand the reason for the crappy service and attitudes and total and complete lack of understanding of items the restaurant has to offer.  STRIKE 5\n\nI can\'t understand why the Salt Cellar is even in business.  The snotty staff has a totally unacceptable attitude towards its customers.  Our waiter knew about all the available salad dressings  but only recommended one and did not even bother with the desert tray.  The food was worse than TERRIBLE.  There was not one good memorable thing about our ""experience"" with the Salt Celler that would bring us back to this disaster.   Everything about this place IS ABSOLUTLY TERRIBLE!', 'We came here to celebrate a co-worker\'s birthday. We\'re a mixed group from all over (Texas  Florida  Maryland  and California). The exterior of the place looks a little odd....... you have to walk down a few flights of stairs to get to the restaurant. But it sure is a lot cooler than down there!!!!! Kind of a unique looking restaurant. \n\nI\'m a natice Northern Cal girl  born and raised in San Francisco....I have fresh seafood at my fingertips on a daily basis. So I was a little skeptical about a seafood place in Phoenix  AZ.\n\nI ordered the New england clam chowder and it was pretty good. Not too salty!!!! I also had the fried shrimp dish. It was prepared just right.  Overall  everyone orderered seafood dishes and enjoyed them. \n\nThe Snicker\'s cheesecake was wonderful.\n\nService was good.........a little slow. Apparantly  the server has to manually compute the tabs if you ask for a split check.  Menu is a little pricey  but worth it for ""Fresh"" seafood.', ""Ate here last night  both my wife and I had the lobster with sides  expensive at $46 each. Both of our lobsters were over cooked  the sides of baked potatos and broccoli were cold. The broccoli was covered with a cheese product that was much too heavy for the vegetable. The baked potato was small and slightly larger than a red potato from the grocery store. Parking is inconvenient and had to park at a business next door. Very disappointing and I will never be back. I don't understand the attraction."", 'My GF and I went to dine here prior to attending Hamilton at Gammage.  I completely spaced that it was a Friday night  because I had intended us to dine at a certain Oyster House in Tempe  and so forgot to make a reservation.  I had not been to the Salt Cellar in over 30 years  back in high school  for a prom or such.  My friend at work reminded me of it  and I am glad he did.\n\nWe put our name on the list  but also got lucky and found 2 seats at the end of the bar.  Extremely lucky  because it only continued to fill up  which we learned is only a testament to the continued popularity of this underground valley landmark.\n\nUnlike another recent reviewer  we ate at the bar.  However  we did order off the Happy Hour menu  so maybe that might be why?  Not sure  but we are returning there in a couple weeks  so I will inquire and follow up.\n\nWe ordered the Oysters on the half shell  Bucket of steamed Mussels  and fresh bread from the HH menu  and also the signature dish  Sauteed Shrimp San Remo from the ""Seasonal Bar Appetizers"" menu.  Strange menu name for a place you supposedly can\'t eat at the bar at?  Again  maybe you can\'t order from the standard menu.\n\nThe Oysters and Mussels were surprisingly larger than we expected!!  My GF remarked on this  as she is a much more experienced seafood aficionado than I.  The bucket of mussels was very generously sized  so I felt a lot better about the $13 price.  The $2 each oyster price  easily justified by their size. The bread was OK.  The Shrimp San Remo  I thought at the time was great  especially for dunking the remaining mussels and bread in  but my GF told me later she wasn\'t that impressed with it.  Worth giving a try to decide for yourself.  Definitely rich though  lots of butter and oil.\n\nDrinks were good  service was good  staff attitudes very welcoming  and the ambiance was very nice.  Bartender (1 of 3) was busy  but very professional and responsive.\n\nAs I stated  we plan on returning.  I am looking forward to trying some new dishes including the Oyster Rockefeller.  We both remarked that it seemed like there were a LOT of regulars in attendance too  so make of that what you will.  How did we know?  Try becoming a regular somewhere and you will learn how to spot them too.\n\nWord of advice - if you want to impress your date and definitely have access to the full menu . . . make a reservation!!  Fortunately  I have the world\'s most awesome GF  so she only teased me for a short time about my failure to do so.  However  I suspect that the fact that we left there happily stuffed probably contributed to that leniency too . . . Nah!!!! She\'s just awesome!!  ;-)', ""Everyone raves about this restaurant but I honestly don't get it.  \n\nThe set up is certainly interesting...the restaurant is entirely underground...thus the name I think.\n\nI went there with a big group and about the only thing I enjoyed was the conversation!  \n\nThe clam chowder was watery and pretty tasteless.  I'm used to good New England chowder after having spent several years on the east coast.  Heck  even Legal Seafoods has better chowda and it's a chain.\n\nThe crab cakes were totally overpriced for what they serve and not that great either.  I've had better and cheaper crab cakes from Costco.\n\nSeriously  this place is overpriced for what you get.  I'd say go to Capital Grille or some such place if you want an expensive meal that also tastes good.  \n\nSorry!  I don't get it!"", 'I will make it a point to visit the Salt Cellar whenever I am in the area! Everything from the service  atmosphere  to the quality of food was A1! For starters we had a spicy shrimp dish. The sauce (good and spicy) was I believe chili peppers in an oil base which was excellent for dipping the rolls  shrimp was cooked to perfection. My entree choice for the night was the swordfish with vegetables a side of King Crab legs. Nice portion of succulent swordfish with tender carrots. The king crab was steamed just right. My son had a baked lobster and was very pleased as well. The restaurant is underground with comfortable seating  nice decor  and a casual upscale vibe. Ended the night with a good pour of Basil Hayden Bourbon from the bartender. Everyone we came in contact with employed by Salt Cellar were professional  friendly  and made sure our experience was great. First timer and looking forward to the next time. KP', 'Went there last year for a birthday. Worst service ever. Food was good but served off time. We felt super rushed even though we had a reservation that was not ready for us. \nIt was the first place I went to when I moved to AZ and had such a good time  with a unique style. But the last time  will be the last time. \nAgain  the food was good.', ""I think this place at one time was pretty good.  I came for dinner with my daughter because she said she wanted to try lobster.  It wasn't very good. I've had better at Red Lobster.  I very disappointed considering the reputation they have.  I would not come here again."", ""I'm from Southern California and know good sea food. This is the one of two places in this state that I will eat sea food. The other is Mastro's Ocean Club.

Well I had on heels  a lace peplum top  and some dark skinnies - and the reality is I was over dressed. The older crowd donned cargo shorts  tommy bahama tops  birkenstocks  and the clothes un-befitting of a reservation based establishment. \n\nWe made it down the wooden stairs and were seated at a gorgeous table. Our waitress was super friendly and talkative and set us up with some specials and brought us a dozen oysters and a wine sampler. \n\nI ordered the salmon served on an onion cake with asparagus spears in a hollandaise sauce. My fiance got this mahi mahi with this pumpkin macadamia nut sauce.\n\nWe finished with a rum dipped cheesecake. \n\nIt was ALL amazing. Every bite was divine. The fish was moist. All of the sauces were super complementary. \n\nTo this day - our eyes open and we think about the cheesecake. We keep meaning to make reservations to come back  but time  life  and distance get the best of us. \n\nIf you\'re looking for a wonderful dinner - this place. go. don\'t wait. be on your way!', ""Oh man  I've been saying it for months & months  people (aka friends)  you have to check out reverse happy hour at Salt Cellar! I do wish there were wine specials (hint hint S.C.) but the food is so outstanding  I couldn't care less about the drink specials they actually do have ($2.75 well drinks & fairly priced beer for those who DO care). \n\nMy friend & I shared several apps which is the best way because you get to try a bit of everything. We devoured almost the entire bucket of mussels that come with a white wine sauce and of course  warm butter. Then the escargo and oysters rockefellar showed up and it was all I could do to not inhale the snails. Ha  that rhymes...anyhoo  be careful not to dive in right away because you may burn your esophogus. Just a fair warning.  The Salt Cellar exceeds with service and delicious food -- it's almost 2nd nature to them -- but the plate presentation all the way down to the side sauces add to every bit of mouth orgasm you can imagine...and this is just happy hour at the bar! Just wait til you can try their entrees!!\n\nI love the Salt Cellar for it's food  but the chill  intimate & classicly styled atmoshere adds to the enjoyable experience.

Out of this world seafood- che.....errr  sorry Salt Cellar  as much as I wanted to love and was excited to try you  you left some to be desired.\n\nAt the suggestions of many close friends whose taste i\'m usually aligned with  I decided this would be my ""special occassion"" pick for my bf\'s bday. The allure of this place is certainly that its uniquely underground and not a chain. You feel as if you are going on a fun  mini trek while heading downstairs to the dining area. Certainly had no probs with the past reviewers comments on noise levels or stuffy air. Salt Cellar is quite small  with limited  close-together seating and a surprisingly stocked bar which houses a great Happy hr I hear. I would suggest asking for a reservation on the ""raised"" corner booths if I were to return.\n\nThe hostess was extremely helpful when I snuck away to order my bf a complimentary bday dessert (you can choose any of the menus offerings) and our waitress was one of the best servers I\'ve had in a long time. Not only did she help us by extensively describing dishes  but she continually checked up on us. We were shocked at the cheap prices of the wine-by-the glasses  yet it all made sense when she brought over some of the smallest glasses that should be allowed to be qualified as wine glases. \n\nEntrees are served with bread  a dinner salad and veggies  and our main course came out lightning fast (is this always a good thing? i think not) I went with the Australian Barramundi w/ Spicy Avocado Vinaigrette ($35)  a white fish the waitress desc. as similar to a halibut. And I gotta say  I thought the point of paying extra $ in AZ for seafood was bc its flown in fresh weekly....but holy moly fishy flavor. I wouldn\'t regard this as a great catch. We were told diners always had a prob with the oily vinaigrette that would separate atop the fish  so they began serving it on the side. This sauce is quite a strong  but good flavor.\n\nMy bf ordered one of the more pricier dishes on the menu - Baked Stuffed Lobster. The stuffing of scallops and crabmeat was ehhh and the overall size of this meal was lacking (altho. we couldve upgraded). The one thing I liked was that you could add an affordable side-order of King Crab Legs to any meal...This dish was certainly better than the Barramundi.\n\nLastly  our flourless choco cake was below par. The consistency almost was as if it was undercooked  and needed a fruit or raspberry sauce to offset its taste. I am curious to try their Kahlua topped  Banana gelato wafer...\n\nOverall  I did enjoy my experience here. Will I be comin back for more and ravin to all my friends about it? Naw. But I can\'t hate on you Salt Celler  afterall  we are in AZ :)', 'Nothing spectacular.... A bit pricy for what it is really...

This was the worst trout I have ever had.  \n\nThe crowd here was mixed  but I got the feeling that the younger crowd was here off the groupon and the normal crowd is older and enjoys the taste of the food.  I could see someone with a different sense of taste loving this place.  \n\nNow the Price is crazy I really should of just left after I ordered a beer and it came in a coffee cup looking glass and the Wife ordered a shot glass size Gin and Tonic for $10.   \n\nI guess it one of those places you have to try once and we did  I just wish I didn't have to pay the $150 tab for fish I going to give to my Great Dane.\n\nI do want to once again point out that the service was good."", ""My absolute favorite fine dining experience.

The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is my most recent dinner there.  The husband ordered steak and lobster and I ordered the salmon.  We both were surprisingly disappointed with our meal.  My salmon was dry and lacked much in the way of flavor  and the hubs said his steak was a bit tough and not very flavorful either.  Our appetizers (crab cakes and steamed mussels) were great  as usual.

Normally when you get seated the cocktail waitress will ask if you need anything to drink...we had no one for 15 minutes even say a word to us after we were sat. Our server comes over and finally takes our order and the food comes out wrong for two of the people. Dore says you can just switch your sides and it will be okay and then walks away. We all just looked at each other and Dore walks away. She knew bringing the food out the entrees were not correct so 1st...why did she bring them out incorrect and not have them fixed 2nd...in a restaurant where you are paying $35-$55 an entree you do not tell a customer to switch sides and food.  NO  our entress never got corrected  we just ate what we had and made it work. It gets even better  we wanted to see the small menu that had the deserrt coffees and drinks in it. Dore tell us we dont really have one and i say to her yes you do we had it when we sat down. Doesnt bring it to us  just lists them off  so i go and get up to get the menu myself.

I ordered a beer and the bartender seemed nice enough  but he also seemed like he was burned out after working behind that particular bar for what must be 20 years.  The beer was served in a bottle and  as usual  overpriced.  A glance at the menu revealed some VERY expensive dinners.  I was SHOCKED to see that these prices were twice what Carlsbad Tavern or Richardson\'s was.   However  it was kind of neat to see this one ""old school"" patron choose his LOBSTER out of the tank.  The timid hostess grabbed the LOBSTER with a net and scurried back the the kitchen was a look of ""ewwww"" on her face.   So  on a 10 scale  this place was about a 7 when I was hoping for a 9.

The decor is very dated and the old cigarette smell sticks after you leave but it has a certain old school vibe about it that makes it unique. I enjoy their mussels and crab cakes.', 'Went there for my daughters birthday. Not a place like it that Ive ever been to. The stairs leading down stairs to the restaurant are very wide and lit up with rope lighting so you can see as you go down. Service was excellent. Servers were very attentive; filling water an brought as much bread as we wanted. Servers were very aware when they had to reach across the table saying excuse me pardon my reach. The table seating was adequate and very nicely setup. Tables were small  but not too close to other patrons. We had halibut  pan fried lobster and muscles. All tasted great and tasted fresh. Plates averaged apprx 34 to 44 dollars. Thats what it cost to fly in and eat fresh seafood in the desert.  Overall 4.5 stars as I prefer to be above ground. Service n food was 5 stars.', 'Food was delicious. Amazing service  waitress named Tony was really helpful and being there the first time. Lobster was expensive but definitely worth it. Whole meal was great and recommend it for anyone looking to find a nice place to eat lobsters.', 'Yum! Definitely a good place for fresh seafood in Phx. Highly recommend! Make reservations and prepare yourself to not see the outside while eating at Salt Cellar. Had the crab cakes for appetizer  halibut and baked lobster as main course. All were excellent and service was an A+!', 'I love the salt cellar . It is my favorite place for sea food. The happy hour in the bar is fantastic with 3.50 well drinks and they just added the four peaks pumpkin porter to theory beer on tab which is delicious :). The tacos  shrimp toast  mussels  shrimp san remo ( shrimp sun dried tomatoes and mushrooms sauteed in a butter sauce...my favorite)  and crab cakes make this place amazing. The service is always attentive and I always feel well taken care of. Dont forget to try the snickers cheesecake for dessert :)', 'I visited last night w/ my family and WILL NOT ever return nor make a positive recomendation.  The hostess was exceptionally rude commenting on our attire  ""Have you seen the ones that just walked in?"" even though were dressed similarly to other patrons.\n\nThe food was below average and the prices high.  I had the shrimp scampi and left it unfinished as it tasted like it was cooked in bathroom cleaner.  There are certainly other seafood places with better quality service and food for less expensive  definitley not worth the $$$.\n\nOur table server was pleasant and professional  much more than I can say for the hostess.  Do not waste your time or $$$ there.', 'Amazing service and delicious seafood! I have been here several times and I keep getting the stuffed lobster. It is so good!!! Escargot was delicious  oysters were fresh and yummy. Great waiter  we will be back!', 'OK  went here because a gal I work with says it is her favorite place in Scottsdale and I got a Groupon sooo...\n\nI actually loved the atmosphere  as other posters state it is underground and dated.  Which  being from the Midwest  reminded me of the ""supper Clubs"" we used to go to with my parents (Midwesterners  you know what I\'m talking about).  Dark-ish  cozy  unusual seating patterns.\n\nFor those complaining about the price  they must still be thinnking in Midwestern terms because $39 for a lobster in Scottsdale is not overpriced (anywhere else yes  but Scottsdale seems to jack up the price on everything).\n\nOK  onto the food  we started with cocktails in the bar which were just meh... average.  We got in late but the place was still hopping even on a Thursday night.  Skipped the apps and went straight for the entrees.  Again reminded of a supper club in that you didn\'t have to order everything ala carte.  All entrees came with salad  vegetable and starch - nice!  I ordered the Halibut cheeks with lemon caper sauce and Hubs ordered the Shrimp Scampi with extra garlic.  I could smell his dish being cooked before it was brought to the table  but he claims he couldn\'t taste the garlic (he is kind of a garlic freak  so a normal person would have said it was loaded).  Cooked nicely with lots of shrimp but nothing special.  The shrimp toast that came with it however was awesome!  I would have ordered this as an entree.  My halibut cheeks were good if a little on the tough side  not so bad but just a little.  They were breaded and pan fried and served with Lemon and capers which was yummy.  Here\'s the kicker  they gave my like 10 cheeks!  That\'s alot of Halibut cheeks  normally you\'d get like 3-4.  So I took a bunch home and made luxurious fish tacos with the leftovers.\n\nSo overall a nice experience  good seafood especially for Scottsdale where it is actually hard to find really good food in general  especially hard to find good seafood.  It\'s no San Francisco or Seattle or Boston  but I would go back and try again.', 'Have driven past this place a ton and decided to give it a try. So glad we did!!!  Fantastic fine dining so be prepared for an experience not a fast dinner. Salmon wellington was fantastic. The Ahi from Hawaii recommended by our server was to die for. Lava cake to top it off.  Spendy meals but well worth the cost for what you get. We will be back in September at our next visit!!', ""The Salt Cellar has been a culinary landmark in the valley since I was just a kid  so I was aware of it's reputation.  I would definitely recommend it based on it's historical significance; however  if you're looking for great all-around seafood experience  you may want to consider some of the other notable seafood restaurants around the valley.\n\nThe atmosphere is cool - in that  the dining area is located underground  making it dimly lit  and the theme is old nautical.  (Although  I did feel slightly claustrophobic once we were seated and had to quickly down some wine to relax that panic.)  The wait staff was attentive and friendly  and we didn't really have to wait long to be served our drinks or meals.\n\nWe ordered the Monk Fish  Crab Cakes  Baked-Stuffed Lobster  and the Salmon.  Everything was tasty and fresh  but the flavors were definitely in line with traditional Seafood dishes.  Not that this is a bad thing - I guess I have just become more comfortable with seafood dishes that have something extra regarding flavor.\n\nI'm glad that I had the experience - hopefully the Salt Cellar has another 30 years left in it  but if I have the taste for seafood again I probably won't go back."", ""Cute little restaurant - dining room  bar and kitchen are in the basement.  Literally a cellar!\n\nThe seafood was good quality and solid.  The mussels smelled a little weird - not sure if it was the broth it was cooked in or the accompanying sauces but something tasted and smelled very weird.  Oysters were good - but kind of expensive.  14 for 6  1.50 if you go to the bar at happy hour.  Stuffed shrimp was not that great.  Alaskan crab legs had a great flavor infused in them.  The sides were not terrible  but not very good - think Red Lobster with much less butter and seasoning (less butter=good  less seasoning=bad).  \n\nAll in all  this is a solid seafood restaurant.  The prices are kind of hefty and I wasn't thrilled with the entree portions.  Recommend just getting appetizers if that.  I will probably go back for oysters at the bar if for anything."", 'Not your typical flashy Scottsdale hang out....  Sounds good to me!  I like the old school interior it is kinda comforting in some sort of historic way.  The food however is to write home about!  For being in the middle of the desert their seafood in phenominal!

Definitely would recommend this place for seafood lovers!!', ""Best in the Valley  it's as good as Ocean's Club in North Scottsdale and not as expensive. I LOVE the happy hour  they also have a reverse happy hour for all you night owls! Great service  fresh and delicious seafood. I'm comparing this to seafood  not just to Phx seafood! It's as good as it gets in the desert.  Love the atmosphere  don't blink  or you might miss it. It looks like an ice shanty on the outside  but opens up underground!"", 'My wife and I visited last night for the first time and really enjoyed it. We arrived not realizing we should have made reservations  so we ended up waiting for an hour; not a big deal. We spent that hour at the bar where the bartenders were very efficient. We tried the scallops as appetizers which were very good. \n\nWe were then seated and greeted by our server quickly. I mentioned my food allergies and the server was very accommodating. I enjoyed the Alaskan Halibut and my wife enjoyed the King Salmon Oscar she ordered. both were cooked excellently.\n\nMy only minor complaints are that it was a bit noisy as it is a ""cellar"" type room  very enclosed. The pricing was a bit high as well  but we really enjoyed our meals so it wasn\'t a big deal. We would definitely return.', ""2.5 overall for the food 3 for the service. The restaurant is old school in feel. My halibut was about as ok as it can get and the side vegetables were over cooked and boring. My mom had the stuffed lobster and was really disappointed  dad finished his scallop dish and seemed happy. My ten year old had the king crab legs and really enjoyed them  I think this was the best entree on the table. My five year olds chicken teriyaki was 18 dollars...we get the hint don't bring your kids. We won't but it's not a nice enough restaurant to get mom and dad to return on a date. Total bill $338"", ""Yum! Can't wait to return for a full-blown dinner here.\n\nCame here for impromptu apps/drinks this past Sunday and was very impressed.\n\nNot only is the location and ambience unlike ANYTHING you'll find in Phoenix  the food was pretty amazing as well. Are you in the cabin of a fisherman's boat in the middle of the Pacific? Are you in the Arizona desert? You'll never know the difference here.\n\nWe pulled up a seat at the bar and ordered a dozen oysters  shrimp cocktail  and fish tacos. \n\nLet me first say that the oysters were HUGE (see pics). The biggest I've ever seen - this might be the first time in my life that I've been full from oysters..the largest shells were the size of my entire palm! I asked one of the bartenders where they came from and he said Chesapeake Bay since the gulf of Cali doesn't produce the best oysters. I found it surprising they were all the way from the East Coast.. they were very fresh.\n\nSensing a theme here the cocktail shrimp were also ginormous and super tasty. Cocktail sauce (has some kick!) tasted homemade  and didn't seem like it came out of a plastic tub.\n\nShrimp/fish tacos were very yummy. They definitely didn't skimp on the portions when they stuffed the tacos and the sauce + coleslaw also had some spicy kick!\n\nTo finish  we ordered the Banana Foster. HOLY COW. It was gone in maybe 3 minutes flat. I'd go back just for that.\n\nWhile this is an upscale restaurant  don't expect to find the nicest of nice things here. The restaurant has been open since the late 70's/early 80's and not much renovation has happened since as evident through the bar cabinets  furniture  etc. I did find it oddly charming the super skinny door entrances (you really feel like you're on a boat!) and that there were high tank toilets with a chain in the bathrooms. \n\nWe will be back soon! :)"", 'Whoaaaa  I can\'t believe I haven\'t reviewed Salt Cellar yet! Well  let me rectify that immediately!\n\nBACKGROUND \n\nI remember when the Salt Cellar was THE place to go for dinner when you had a date.\n\nAlthough there are now all sorts of nouveaux chic pop-ups that are stealing the limelight  Salt Cellar maintains itself as a decent place to get some tasty seafood.\n\nSALT CELLAR\n\nSalt Cellar was established in 1971  and continues to reign atop the ""Best Of Seafood"" lists. \n\nOwners Richard and Cindy Huie follow the business philosophy that consistency  quality  equitable pricing and great service are the key to success.\n\nThe culinary adventure begins with its unique underground location. \n\nOne peek through the ground-level skylight reveals a world far removed from the desert; take the antique wooden stairway down 3 flights and you will find yourself transported to a snug seaside hideaway.\n\nSalt Cellar\'s fresh fish and seafood selections will take you around the world; from Hawaii  Alaska  the Gulf of Mexico  Chesapeake Bay  Boston  Georges Bank and even New Zealand. \n\nThe Salt Cellar is known for always having available a selection of whole Maine lobster; 1lb  3lb  and 5lb. \n\nThe extensive menu abounds with choices that will surely satisfy every craving.  \n\nIn addition to the year-round and seasonal fresh fish  the Salt Cellar serves choice Black Angus steaks  a chicken entrée and even beef Wellington.\n\nTHE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE \n\nAs I mentioned  I\'ve been going to Salt Cellar for years.\n\nOn our last couple occasions  we went for family birthday gatherings. Their dining room is PERFECT for a bigger  yet intimate  setting.\n\nI had the oysters on the half  which were large in cup size AND meat size  and DELICIOUS. I also had the fresh mussels in drawn butter broth  which were FANTASTIC. \n\nI get the fresh lobster every time.\n\nThey have the fresh lobsters in a tank  so you can actually see what you\'re getting.\n\nI even indulged in one of their specialty dessert cakes  which I didn\'t share with anyone  even though they offered several forks.\n\nI had them make me a tasty girly drink of amaretto  orange juice  grenadine  and a ton of cherries.\n\nThe service is usually exceptional  although Tim got a little snippy at the end  making comments about who he had to listen to  and who was ""paying the bill."" Ohhh Tim  big faux pas to discuss the bill AND insult the restaurant picker of the family  but whatever  I\'m obnoxious  so I\'ll take the blame ;)\n\nCONCLUSION \n\nSalt Cellar is an oldie but goodie. I\'m still a fan and will keep coming back.\n\n4/5 RECOMMEND \n\n*Plenty of parking out front.\n\n*Difficult stairway for some to manage.\n\n*For more information: saltcellarrestaurant.com', 'I highly recommend this place. love love love it. service was amazing and everyone was so kind. very nice and romantic atmosphere.', ""It's a hidden gem. Located underground  its ambiance is cozy and inviting. The food is delicious (for the most part))  the service is homy and the drinks are decent. During the happy hour  it's especially inviting ;)\nThe best dish on the menu is shrimp San Remo. Order one person as you won't want to share. ;)\nOther dishes had very great flavor but some (turtle soup in particular) were missing some basic salt and pepper."", ""Stepping into this establishment is like stepping into New England on the coast.  This place is so charming  I love how its entry door is a little shack  and leaves one with woderment of what is to come once you walk in  and down the staircase.  The lighting is slightly dim  giving way to a great spot for a romantic date  or just an elegant touch to any dining experience.  The seafood is amazing quality  fresh  and although a bit pricey  its worth it as AZ doesn't have an ocean  so save a little to enjoy the dishes here.  My favorite is the salmon wellington  and don't forget about the escargot!  By far the best seafood offerings in Arizona  in my opinion.  When its hot out in the middle of the summer  hide in the Salt Cellar  where its cool and charming.  Its a great place to go to all year long  especially great for birthdays/anniversaries."", ""The Salt Cellar has really gone down hill. They just hire anyone off the streets. I sat in the bar with some High End clients and couldn't believe the awful service we received. There was a bald tall gay man working the bar who obviously hated his job. As soon as we sat down I was unsure what I wanted to drink and right away you could tell he was annoyed. We ordered appetizers (witch he nor the other 80 year old bar back never mentioned one time the happy hour specials) then I ordered my martini and it was like pulling teeth. Thank goodness the food was a 6 out of 10 and that's saying a lot. I will never return and I would discourage anyone to come here and bring a business partner  date  etc. To many other places\nto drop a few bills plus at."", ""My boyfriend and I went here for happy hour and dinner before a play on Friday night. I love that they are underground. It does add a romantic feel to the place. \n\nWe started with a couple of oyster shots and stuffed baked clams in the bar. The oysters and clams are $1.50 each during HH and the stuffed baked clams were $1.75 each. The stuffed clams were large and yummy. The shooters were good too but they came with a lot of sauce. They have a cute bar so I can see myself coming here for HH again. My one complaint is that I ordered the stuffed clams when we were in the bar having drinks and they were taking quite some time. While we were waiting the hostess came and got us because our table was ready and told us that they would bring the clams when they were ready to our table. Well we were seated  ordered and got our salads and still no stuffed clams (which I paid for at the bar  they made sure I closed out before I was seated). We notified our waitress and she said that no one had told her anything. She checked and then came back and said they had put in a wrong order and they were just baking. I understand places make mistakes but once someone has been waiting at least 25-30 minutes for something that should have taken 10 at the max  then comp the item or offer a comped dessert. We got neither. \n\nAnyway dinner was good. Their salad had a bit too much of the vinaigrette. I had the stuffed lobster and it was a lot of food. My boyfriend had the petite fillet and said it was cooked perfectly but lacked flavor. I'd still give this place another try."", ""My boy friend took me to the Salt Cellar to celebrate my birthday. It's one of my favorite spots! The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable  and the food is incredible! You can never go wrong with the blackened Ahi Tuna or the crab legs. My boy friend had the seasonal halibut and it was cooked to perfection! I finished the night off with some excellent desserts and after dinner cocktails. I can't wait to come back! Make sure to ask for Cara. She was an exceptional server  and extremely knowledgeable!! Thank you Salt Cellar!! You never disappoint!"", 'My husband and I went to the Salt Cellar for our anniversary. They served him a steak that was rancid. It kind of ruined the entire evening. In fact  not long after that we decided to become vegan.

Needless to say  we will not be returning.', 'I was weird at first  i saw a small building and though that was too small to be a restaurant. I then notice that it was underground.

I read a few reviews before I posted this and I can\'t believe ANYONE would ever post anything negative. I have been there during the week  on the weekends  early evening  late night it doesn\'t matter the service is always superb and the food delicious.\nI found one of reviews about the steaks absurd. If you go to a seafood place and expect to get an inch and a half steak. Why not ask the server ""are your steaks thick""? Why would you assume that a great seafood restaurant has equally great steaks? \nI will advise that if you want to get in to this restaurant for dinner  make a reservation. There aren\'t a lot of tables and its very busy. Again  I have never had a meal at the salt cellar that wasn\'t delicious.

Just imagine  perfectly cooked shrimp in a dish filled with flavorful garlic and butter sauce.  It\'s the kind of sauce that you don\'t want to share with any one.

The escargot in mushroom caps is good  but I'd rather just have the escargot in garlic butter and do without the mushroom caps (they blocked the true flavors of the dish).  The ceviche was very good and the oysters were good too.  Ambience wise  it is pretty dark overall (well  maybe that is because it is underground).

The crab was overcooked and tiny and had raw almonds thrown on top of it.  AND my plate arrived steaming with BELL PEPPERS.  As we sent everything back  seriously inedible.

Maybe we just had a bad server but my experience here left no desire to ever return. When a customer orders their food a particular way  you don't then serve it completely different with the excuse of I think you'll like it better my way. Because of this server...the best part of my meal was the steamed baby carrots...and I paid much more than I should have to enjoy baby carrots."", 'Under ground restaurant  dim light for romantic casual dinner  pricey but very worthed to wait. The waiters very informative and fast! I love to go back!!!', ""We would have been better off at Red Lobster... And I don't like Red Lobster. The food was out dated and over cooked. The service was crude and charged us for a dish they forgot and made us wait just to get it Togo. Way to own up to your mistake. We wanted to go to a bit nicer place since it is our Anniversary and were completely disappointed. For the money we spent we could of had bought all that seafood and prepared it better myself and paid for some personal entertainment for the evening. Lessened learned we will not be returning. Unfortunately we had to learn this tasteless lesson on such a special night. I must add before I end that my husband broke out in red spots and fever an hour after eating at The Salt Cellar. I'm most certain this was just a coincidental allergy after talking to a doctor giving him Benadryl. He felt better after taking the medicine but we both grew up on seafood in the Northwest and he has never experienced anything like that after eating seafood. The only dish he ate that I refused to was the steamed muscles because they were so small and over cooked but maybe they were just poor quality. I know I have high standards after just now getting out of the food industry after culinary school and ten years in restaurants  BUT this is the first time I have felt strongly enough to write a yelp review in hopes of warning someone who was also thinking of trying The Salt Cellar for the first time to just not. Maybe if the service was a amazing I would not have been inspired to write my first review but it was just was bad as the food. I just give up. Good seafood does not happen in the desert. Sigh."", ""I've been meaning to visit this restaurant for a long time.  Needless to say that I've built up my expectations over time.  When I was finally there  I was very disappointed.  The New England clam chowder was so watery.  It was a bowl of soup  definitely not chowder.  The escargots were tasteless.  The best dish for the night was the jumbo shrimp pasta.  Not much presentation but it was tasty.  I will not come back again.  It wasn't worth it."", ""Never paid so much for food that I could of gotten at long   John silvers. Terrible and won't return."", ""Keep on driving ... Mother of god. I almost got in a fight with my girlfriend trying to find parking because there was surprisingly a lot of people here so I suggested we park in the street. Right now after having dinner and several drinks at their happy hour I'm wishing that our fight would've landed us both incredibly angry at each other so we just went home because I would still have $85 in my pocket and not want to slit my wrist at the meal that I just had. \n\nLet's start with oysters... everybody knows if you get an oyster that is at least a pound it's going to taste like everything that it's lived by for the last 37 years... minerals  human garbage  you get the idea. Let's talk about chowder - is that the red or the white? Both types of this classic mirage of seafood deliciousness always bring a smile to my face  but if you're going to serve something that is runny and wishing for more oyster crackers ( basically POW porridge that the Koreans wouldn't even serve ) I eat it so not to offend the nice bartender. \n\nNext the crab cakes....or should I say loaf of bread that was soaked in clam juice... But the chef still had the sack to charge 15$. \n\nI'll finish with the fish and chips...two decent size pieces of fish cooked relatively well  not too shabby. The texture of the fried fish was a bit soggy ..good color ..but a bit soggy.. The tartar sauce was surprisingly delicious as it made me forget about the sog. But the kicker to this dish was the chips... when you order fish and chips you expect nice potatoes  either in gaufrette form or traditional fries. Here at this particular establishment they served what I would like to call Chinese Stars  a chip so stale that if you threw it across the room you would decapitate seven people..... In short I would like everybody to know that guns don't kill people  Chinese Stars and stale chips do. \n\n*disclaimer... Written by my boyfriend.... I'm not that funny"", 'I went here because I got a groupons certificate  and my experience is overall very good. From the out side the restaurant looks incredibly small but it\'s actually underground hence ""cellar"". Right away i love that concept. But as soon as I walked in it felt kind of hot and the stair way down smell a bit like urine. As soon as I got down to the main floor it was nice and cool. The atmosphere seem very grown up. The food was pretty good and the service here is excellent. Right away I told my waiter I have a groupon coupon and he didnt give me any attitude like I had expected. My utensils where changed with every course and my water was always filled  he never came around too often to interrupt  my dinner and ask id everything was good  which I appreciate.

We walked in on a Saturday night in October to find they had an hour long wait. The bar was wide open  so we decided to go that route instead. We were informed when we sat down that we could only order appetizers and the bar. This to me was very disappointing. I decided to try and keep an open mind anyway. I ordered the Shrimp San Remo  which came highly recommended on here and thought it was delicious. The sauce was definitely the main attraction. The shrimp were a little on the small side and it only came with six  so I asked if I could get a little side salad of some sorts. Nope  only appetizers at the bar. No salads either. WTH?!?! My boyfriend ordered the mussels appetizer and said they tasted like the mussels you buy at Fry's down the street. So unfortunately  my first experience was not so good. I would be willing to try it again if I am able to order off the full menu.

Do yourself a favor  and just order at least 6 for each person.  The bucket of clams for $13--so fresh--so good.  The clams are steamed and comes with clam juice and butter to dip  super simple  super delicious.

We received horrible treatment from top down: owner  manager and server because we weren\'t spending enough money... and the money we were spending (probably around  $200+ total) wasn\'t worthy of a table. Now myself  my family  nor the friends I was with will ever spend another dime in this poor-excuse for a ""service industry"" establishment ever again.\n\nDetails:\nMyself along with four other coworkers came here after work on a Friday to order drinks and food. We all arrived separately between 5-5:30 and put our name in for a table because the bar area did not have enough open seating for us. Two rounds of drinks and about 40 minutes later  we are seated. The waitress offered transfer our bar tab to our new waitress at the table  but we wanted to pay the bartender  to ensure he was getting tipped for his time helping us at the bar.\n\nOnce we were seated  we ordered appetizers  and we continued to order drinks.  About 45 minutes in  the server came over and proceeded to say that if we are not ordering dinner  Salt Cellar needs to use the table for people who actually will be ordering dinner. \n\nSo  we  paying customers  need to leave our table because we aren\'t ordering food of a certain price point? Mind you  we weren\'t just taking up space  we were still ordering food and drink!!!\n\nNaturally  our reaction was to question her action. She stood firm. We went to the manager to explain what had just happened. Then  the MANAGER essentially said yeah  if you aren\'t ordering dinner  we need you to leave the table because there are people waiting to eat dinner. Was extremely rude about it  too. (weird concept  waiting for a table at a restaurant  right?)\n\nThat alone made us want to leave  and also made us realize that our waitress was probably told to say that  and it probably wasn\'t her fault. So on our way out  I apologized to our waitress for the way I reacted. \n\nThe owner overheard me apologizing and asked what was going on  and I proceeded to tell him about our experience. To which he  THE OWNER  responded by telling me that I was wrong. Said we couldn\'t sit at the table if we weren\'t ordering dinner. He said that we ""misrepresented"" our intentions of what we would be ordering (we never said we wanted dinner) Anyway  I told him that it\'s wrong to treat customers that way  and he argued me. Told me I was wrong and we need to leave.\n \n\nJust FYI: we are not a rowdy crowd  we were not loud  annoying  inappropriately dressed.

Then the bill came and we were still being charged for the appetizer we never got and it said that they voided my husband's dinner  which would have been cool but we didn't ask for any discounts...but then when you added the bill up it was still in the total. So  we said the bill was off and she brought another check that said the appetizer and my husband's dinner was voided our but only the appetizer was off. It just seemed like they were trying to swindle us with the check and it seemed shady. We're very good tippers...usually around 25-30% especially for good service  but my husband left like maybe $5 on a bill of almost $140.

It is expensive (for what it is) so you would think it would be nicer inside than it is. It's really old-school and the tables are close together and not private and the food is 100% mediocre.

No one offered flashlights or even seemed to notice.  I ordered the swordfish with mango salsa.  The fish tasted fine but there was no imagination in the salsa or the side dishes.  The mango was very tart and overall bland.  My husband had the salmon oscar which is served over bread pudding.  He said the salmon and crab were good enough but again the bread pudding was tasteless and an odd thing to have combined with the seafood.  Salads served with the entree were boring and even the dressing could not help. Our waitress was pleasant enough but seemed to have a superior attitude for some reason.  We were truly disappointed.

We giggled about it and my husband pointed it out to the waitress--being completely friendly. The waitress in turn looked at the plate  said nothing  turned around and walked away and then rolled her eyes! BEYOND rude! Did not acknowledge it at all & was clearly very irritated. My husband then approached the lady at the front to let her know what just happened and how rude she was. She listened  but did absolutely nothing about it. Another waitress helping us (we had 3 waitresses by the way) corrected the situation and brought me another oyster. We wanted to speak to a manager  but found out the lady at the front that my husband spoke to--the one who did not budge when we told her what happened  was the owner's wife! When the rude waitress did what she did  the owner's wife was right next to us because we were sitting at the bar by the door  right by the hostess podium. Clearly  this waitress DID NOT CARE at all! We pretty much came to the conclusion that the rude waitress was a family member of the owners. We spent over $200 for food and drinks between the 4 of us during the not so happy hour yesterday. Needless to say--we will NEVER go to the Salf Cellar again. First and last time. Great oysters...HORRIBLE waitress and an owner who did not do anything about it--fell on deaf ears. It is because the owner failed to be apologetic or even acknowledge that we were mistreated by one of her staff that we will not return. We spent a lot of money here. I will spread the word to everyone too. \nP.S. The rude waitresses name was Alicia"", 'For our Anniversary my wife  and i went to the Salt Cellar. Making sure to have a nice seat  we made reservations after reading advice to do so on yelp!\n\nWe went there for our anniversary  but also to try the food after reading many reviews . Ordering many appetizers  about 4-5 in total during happy hour  and 3-4 entress  we picked at each one. Not eating with an appetite  we took our time tasting all of the dishes! They were all great  and we were happy to be taking how left overs!\n\nForget Bob D.  and Papadeaux  unless you like glass in your lobster tail...\nIf you looking for authentic  fresh  satisfaction  this is the place to go. If you like the fast food  commercialized seafood quick bite  Papadeaux will probably suite you best.\n\nThe food at Salt Cellar is prepared fresh  with the time you woudl expect food like this to take  instead of a 10-15 minute arrival.\n\nThe atmosphere was very relaxing  and romantic. The only thing i can say that needed improvement was the hanging  sprayed painted egg cartons  placed on the ceiling as decoration. Many were hanging on for dear life  making us wonder if any would fall on us? Dont let that make you think twice though. It it very well decorated throughout with many theme setting items! Very authentic!\n\nWe ordered such appetizers as: Scallops  Crab cakes  Oysters Rockefeller  Shrimp Cocktail  and Steamed Mussels! \n\nPresentation and taste was unbelievable!!!\nSo many great combinations  and the evidence of how frsh everythign was could not be denied!\n\nFor Dinner we ordered:\n\nMahi-mahi  Salmon Wellington  Beef Wellington  and Baked stuffed shrimp!\nI cant even go into enough detail to explain how great everything was! We obviously had 4-5 to go boxes.\n\nDefinetly not cheap  but well worth the price for the quality  service  and atmosphere!! I reccommend this place to any seafood lover! make it a special occasion!\n\nLong review yes  but still does no justice. Salt cellar deserves every word !\n\nThank you Salt Cellar for your quality in food  and hospitality!\n\nJosh & Angel', ""If this establishment stuck to happy hour it would be 5 stars. I'd been in 3 or 4 times for apps and drinks at the bar which were fantastic but dinner was a pretty big disappointment.\n\nThe food is reasonably decent but the service simply did not match the price point. I felt like it was a bunch of college students running around in confusion. Used plates stayed on the table for 45 minutes  silverware was forgotten or not replaced in-between courses  and basic requests kept being missed. \n\nIf you are looking for a great place to have happy hour  I highly recommend Salt Cellar but dinner at the cost would probably be better had somewhere else with a higher level of table service."", 'Great happy and reverse happy hour!

We arrived about 45 minutes early and had appetizers and drinks at the bar. Service and the shrimp cocktail were awesome!  The hostess was able to seat us early which was nice  but we were surprised by the small the tables and the close quarters in the small dining area that we were in. I suppose it is a good use of space but be prepared for tight squeeze. It is fine once you get used to it. It didn\'t bother us much but a group of four came and were really bothered by it and complained but decided to stay. We ordered the New England clam chowder which was the best I\'ve had in awhile. We planned to get more seafood but when we saw Beef Wellington on the menu we had to get it!  We were not disappointed!  We had the Creme Brûlée for dessert and it was perfectly done!  Overall great experience  prices are high but that is expected since this you\'re getting fresh seafood in Arizona. It\'s a landmark  it\'s been featured on the tv show ""Check Please  Arizona"" with excellent reviews. Highly recommend you try it at least once!', ""This is a very unique restaurant to visit for special occassions; I love how everything is underground!  The bar's selection of liquor is very impressive and pretty affordable.  Dinner has always been superb on my visits.  My only complaint is that sometimes you get stuck sitting very closely to other tables because the restaurant is rather small."", ""Oh  what a disappointment.  Reading reviews  I was expecting a very good seafood dinner.  While the ambiance was nice and the wait staff was efficient  they could not make up for a very high priced Red Lobster type dinner.  After being seated  our first warning was when the waiter mentioned that the salmon and tuna were not wild  but farm raised.  Any restaurant that builds their reputation on seafood  knows to only serve fresh and wild  not farm raised.  My wife who is an unofficial clam chowder aficionado  had a small bowl as an appetizer  and had to send it back.  It was the worst she has ever tasted.  I ordered the crab cakes as the entree expecting them to be fresh and meaty Maryland crab.  Unfortunately  while the crab was large  and the filler kept to a minimum  they had no crab taste  suggesting that they were not fresh crab  but either made from canned crab or imitation crab.  A very disappointing experience.  We will not return. Red Lobster would be a better choice for a better meal and half the price - and we are not Red Lobster fans.  Next time Blue Water Grill or Mastro's Ocean Club."", 'Can not beat the Atmosphere and eclectic location of this place. \n\nThis is my go to Sea Food place in Phoenix.

Each of us had seafood and it was very tasty. Dessert was amazing too. I enjoy that you can wear jeans or you can dress nicely. It was more expensive than I'm used to  but I knew that beforehand. It is not someplace I'd eat at every week  but reserve for special occasions."", 'Started with escargot - in mushroom caps - dip the bread into the butter and garlic - my fav appetizer of all time! We had the Alaskan king crab legs with rice and vegis - which has to be one if the best meals money can buy.

San Rimo shrimp dish is also excellent - both in appetizer or pasta dinner. Owner Richard Huie chatted with us and thanked us for coming on our way out. A wonderful experience that is always consistently excellent every time we dine at the Salt Cellar.  5 star all the way.', ""Seriously.....F*** this place!  Disgusting food and shitty service  ambience is great if you like to dine in a hot cellar engulfed in stagnated air.  Truly it is over rated  over priced  and they just under deliver.

How's that for a head change  you don't even have to pay for it!\n\nI won't disgust you with the detailed review of everything I have tried here  but to make it simple  it all sucks!

Instead we received dishes that ranged from OK to awful. \n\nWe started with Escargot on mushroom caps in garlic butter and New England clam chowder.  The clam chowder was a thin bland soup with a goodly supply of clams. The Escargot was chewy in a butter sauce with just a hint of garlic.  \n\nMy Atlantic Halibut was fishy  dry and hard. After confirming my opinion with my table mates I sent it back. Overcooking Escargot and Halibut at a seafood restaurant should be considered fatal errors. My wife and granddaughter had Crab Cakes and Scallops which they judged just OK. Not good enough for almost $80.00 in (2) entrees. To the restaurant's credit  the Halibut was taken off my bill without asking. \n\nThe restaurant is literally in a cellar. As the air conditioner cycles  the environment alternates between clammy and freezing.  \n\nWe had a cocktail waitress (I haven't seen one of those in many years) which is code for over-priced soft drinks in a small glass with no refills. \n\nThe Food Network has a show  Restaurant Impossible  in which the host   Robert Irvine  visits failing restaurants and fixes their problems.

The wellington I had before didn't have a sauce...it didn't need it. This wellington was the blandest piece of meat I've ever had...great cut of meat but it was like it was boiled in just water and the pastry on my husbands wellington was soggy.

The king crab legs are my favorite thing on the menu  besides the shrimp San Remo appetizer which is a must have! I will say  the prices have increased dramatically  so I have not been back in quite some time for dinner. I always start at the bar  and then sit down for dinner. I would go more often and sit at the bar for a drink  appetizer and salad  but you are not allowed to order salad in the bar area.

I had reservations already at Capital Grille  because I saw that Salt Cellar initially had a 3.5 yelp rating. I can honestly say  the Salt Cellar is a pure 5. Upon driving up to Salt Cellar  I was confused by its street 'look'. Its tiny as the restaurant is underground. Stairs  stairs down and we were greeted by a friendly hostess. We had deliberately gone to the Salt Cellar early  so that we could have some oysters on happy hour  (that runs 7 days!)  and a couple of drinks prior to dinner. My boyfriend had the $1.50 happy hour Oyster Shooter. Not gonna lie  I was just  icked by that. He loved it though. A raw oyster in a shot glass with a very good cocktail/horseradishy sauce and topped with vodka. Its his birthday.. he can do what he wants! We ordered a app of Oysters Rockefeller. They weren't my favorite  but they were still very good. Some restaurants do rockefeller different and I tend to like mine with a little red sauce involved. At dinner  we started with a very good Emeritus Pinot and the Shrimp San Remo. The San Remo is a specialty here at Salt Cellar. Decent sized prawns in a garlic  wine  butter  sun dried tomatoe saute; capped with portabello slices. Very good. I think I craved that a day later! Katie  our waitress  was an awesome waiter. She knew her stuff and the menu like the back of her hand. Scott inquired about the Turtle Soup and she graciously  brought him a sample. Dinner was me having a large stuffed lobster tail. Stuffed with scallops and crab meat and baked with a panko breading. I paired it with a filet for $18 more. The Beef Wellington Scott had was melt in your mouth awesome. Needless to say we were full by the time we both had a few bites. The breads are divine. The service is impeccable.

My conclusion is that Red lobster would\'ve been a better choice. The menu is extremely  extremely over priced. My boyfriend & I opted to share a couple different appetizers. The clam chowder was not a chowder  it was the runniest soup I had ever had. Flavor was average. The crab cake appetizer however was very filling and flavorful. The calamari however was the absolute worst. The consistency was horrid and the smell was incredibly rank  it smelt like a stinky foot. The plate presentations were the laziest I\'ve seen for this ""fine of dining"". Some sprigs of parsley and a giant leaf of lettuce is a joke. Really expected more out of this place.

We have always had great service - specifically with service and food.  This time was different  a woman named Mary greeted us and was very unsavory.  She was curt and rude when my family entered and was extremely agitated.  Please train your staff  specifically Mary on proper customer service and consider moving her to another portion of your business that does not include service to the public.', 'I have no clue why it has taken me so long to come check this place out!  I had always heard great things - I love funky places (its totally underground - a cellar)! Awesome Happy Hour!!! \n\nCame here for happy hour and sat at the bar by the time I left the place was packed and it was a Wednesday! \n\nWe started with the shrimp bread - this was not my choice order but I was happily surprised.  It was tasty! \n\nOysters were awesome! Fresh!  I like that you can order the amount you want and not get 1/2 dozen or a dozen. $1.5 for each. \n\nNext we had the bucket of clams - This was different.  You get the steamed clams in a bucket and the broth and drawn butter in ramekins on the side... the clams had such great flavor and freshness they were great on their own.  \n\nI then tried the Manhattan Clam Chowder because not many places in Arizona actually make Manhattan.  I will say it was Ok - it tasted much more like a vegetable stew with a few clams.  I would stick to the traditional New England here. \n\nHalibut ceviche - great flavor BUT the fish has been sitting in the citrus too long and was no longer firm - it became mushy.  Lime/Lemon cooks the fish if it sits too long the acid starts to break down the fish. The texture was off.  Like they had made the batch the night before or early that morning and it just got mushy :(  I would give this another go because the flavor mix was great. \n\nNow something I didn\'t try - but the two ladies sitting next to us had ordered the escargot - They said it was absolutely delicious and baked to perfection.  I will take their word for it.  I have had a bad snail experience so I passed on this little dish :) \n\nEven though two of the dishes were ""okay"" I still loved it and will be back to try more!  Definitely recommend if you are looking for some yummy seafood.', ""Great seafood... Always. Tried the swordfish this time and it was perfectly prepared with a mango chutney. \n\nNot a fancy place but charming and unique. Amazing seafood dishes  decent prices and super service.\n\nTry it  you'll like it!"", 'The best seafood restaurant ever!!! I had the whole  main lobster. The buttery  soft  smooth lobster just melted through my mouth and down my whole body! I was so happy to finally have good lobster. The creme brulee was 1 of the best I have had. The cold custard  under the hot carmilized sugar made every bite taste better than the last bite. The service  was on point.', ""This place has an awesome concept! It's underground! Their food has been great the two times I've been there. They have an excellent surf and turf option. Also make sure you start off with the Clam Chowder! Great service  awesome atmosphere. The lighting is a bit dim in there  but hey  it's underground."", ""We went to the Salt Cellar for our wedding anniversary and I really liked this place.  The ambiance was great  the concept of putting the restaurant underground is clever  The service was great  and I think the pricing was reasonable for the quality of the food.  \n\nI had the Alaskan King Crab with the filet.  A filet is a filet almost anywhere you go so it was good.  The crab was for sure above average.  My husband got the stuffed lobster tail with the filet and the stuffed lobster was the best I've ever tasted.   They gave us a free dessert b/c we were celebrating our anniversary so we ordered the amaretto cheesecake....ah-may-zing.  Expect to spend around $150 for the meal if you don't order an appetizer but for a nice dinner out it's worth every penny.  We'll return to the Salt Cellar for sure."", ""We were very unimpressed with this restaurant. A lot of people would disagree with us since it has been in business for 45 years and it was very busy even at 9 o'clock on a Saturday night. But here's our experience. The oysters were good and fresh but not cold enough. The salads were very pedestrian something you would expect a Denny's or some other semi fast food place. My husband had grouper with a so-called thai sauce. The grouper with decent quality but that I thought was Mae ploy direct from the bottle from Safeway or any other Market. My shrimp scampi have garlic and were swimming in butter to the point it looked like butter soup. So there was nothing interesting or complex about the dishes. And it was $170 for two people with two glasses of wine. I have yet to find a seafood place here in town that meets my standards but this certainly didn't."", 'Defiantly recommend. Food was great!! Aj was the bar tender. He knew his stuff !! Very friendly and knew all the best dishes. Great atmosphere. Great service. Will come back !', ""Been to the place twice.  Don't plan on going back.  Bottom line...Overpriced  lousy service  mediocre food  and unpleasant ambience and employees.  Took 10 minutes to get an iced tea.  Salad had browning lettuce in it.  Undercooked broccoli had flavorless  thick  white  mystery goop on it.  Salad plates had more finger prints on them than I have ever seen at any restaurant.  Salad plates sat on the table  until main courses were plopped down.  Half-Cooked  luke-warm scallops sat in a bath of cool butter wine solution.  Baked potato was good  although smallish.  Attitude of servers was condescending.  Been served better food  with better service at Red Lobster.  The high prices  reasonable if it was a four or five star restaurant  but  it is not.  Felt the whole experience was irritating  unsatisfying  and a total ripoff.  Don't understand the good reviews."", ""Forget McCormick & Schmick's   Fish Market... make this your Seafood destination instead... I guess one might be trepidatious in having seafood in an arid  land locked desert- but fret not- you're in for a treat- surely if they can put a hockey team in a desert- why not a stellar seafood restaurant...Go ahead put on that bib and try exotic presentations from Chilean bass to marlins to staples like a bucket of old fashioned Alaskan crab legs or surf and turf combos...Then catch a game with the Coyotes!"", ""So I know this place is known for their seafood but I do what I want so I ordered the prime rib.

I knew this was an upscale restaurant  I had been wanting to check out this underground restaurant for years just never made it in. It was as I imagined  you go down the stairs and indeed a very nice  romantic  quaint restaurant and bar area.  \n\nWhile our steaks were magnificent  the service is what really stood out for me. Our waiter was charming  friendly  helpful and funny.  The prices are expensive  our bill for 2 steaks  a few drinks and desert came out to 150 with tip.

So good!"", 'This is based on customer service when calling... \nWhen we were in we had asked about an old groupon that we had found from 2011- they said they would actually honor it up to 5 years.

I thought that was awesome they honored that for so long!\nThis was a few months back that I had asked so I called to confirm - the woman I spoke with was not much of a peach.. she just kept telling me it ended in August.. but it clearly says Dec. I know nothing about August - if thats true that should have been told?

My parents were in town for a week of golf and sun and I thought it would be such a treat to go to The Salt Cellar for dinner! I called and made a reservation for 6 people and we were excited to dine! I love that the restaurant is underground and the ambience is so quant and nice. It was a busy night and we were cheerfully created by the ladies at the host stand and promptly taken to our table.  Toni was our server and was very knowledgeable and sweet. She answered all of our many questions and even pointed out some of her favorite menu items  and seasonal items. We started with mussels  crab cakes and a Sautéed shrimp San Remo. Every bite was amazing!! The mussels were huge!! We then had salads and anxiously awaited our main courses. 3 orders of crab legs  a seared Ahi tuna  scallops and a Ribeye!! Yumm!! Toni even came out and cracked the crab legs open with the help of another server Jon! Such a treat. We of course ended the night with a Salted Carmel Gelato!! The service  the food and the ambience definitely make this a go to spot! Everyone couldn't stop talking about our experience  and we all can't wait to dine here again."", ""Came here for my birthday dinner. We ordered the oysters and a shrimp cocktail for our appetizers. The bread came out and was nice and warm with soft butter. I didn't want to eat too much bread because I know the dinner servings are large. I ordered the king crab legs while my boyfriend ordered the the char broiled scallops. Both were phenomenal. We ordered some drinks from the bar. The bartender is amazing  great lemon drops  really good wine selection. The salad was nice and cold and crisp  wonderful house vinagarette dressing. Everything was really top notch. The server then brought me a creme brulle for my birthday. The only thing I would say is if you don't come here really hungry  be prepared to leave with left overs. The serving sizes are huge.

We made reservations here for our anniversary dinner knowing what a phx staple this place is. table was ready which woudlnt have been a problem considering that the place was empty. My hubby had the scallops and lobster which were average at best. I had the steak ordered rare it came more medium and wasnt that tasty. For the price i just wasnt impressed. there is a ton of great food in the area and i wont be returning. it wasnt all bad the wait staff was very friendly and the oysters were ok. just the quality isnt there for the price.', ""It's like time travel. To a place with baked potatoes  heavy butter cream sauce and inflexible options. Also no salad. Well a side salad but I would have liked one for dinner and was denied. One of the specials was Nantucket scallops. Being from the area I was excited but they came out and the breading was off and the presentation involved potato chips. Food was disappointing. \n\nSecond regarding ambience. The most recent review on the wall was from 2004. I was hit in the head with a beer bottle by the cocktail waitress. She was nice and apologized but had more to do with the layout of the restaurant that it was inevitable. \n\nI don't understand how it's still there. It's a weird place."", ""My lobster was tough and stringy and despite the fact that our server cracked it open for us  I still had to dig and dig and dig for less than bite-sized pieces of lobster.

It's our favorite dish  and it never fails to amaze.\n\nWe always enjoy top-notch service  food  and spirits in this restaurant. What a blessing to live a mile from there! :)\n\nNOISE-SENSITIVE DINERS: When making your reservation  find out if large parties are seated at the same time or in the same room as your table. Noise is a problem as this restaurant is underground and the walls reflect everything. Try to book during off-peak hours if you can.

We then had a combined serving of steamed clams and mussels (half priced on the Happy hour menu (4-7).  The Shrimp San Rameo was excellent.  8 shrimp with portobello mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes  along with garlic aND onion.  Great combination.  \nDinner is why we are raving about this place.  My Beef Wellington was the absolute best.  They use actual pate.  It was perfectly cooked  baked  and the filet was rare.  Marvelous.  Their idea of surf and turf is to include a whole 1 1/4 lb.

It is one of their signature dishes and they do it right  it is very similar to lobster thermidor minus the heavy sauce. My wife had some turtle soup which was unique and tasty.

So not only did we try quite a few items we also spent a lot for 2 people. From the moment we walked downstairs and met up with hostess and got ignored for a few minutes when we were the only ones there. I mean the hostess was five feet from us and only gave us a weird look until another gal came and sat us. The server seemed as tho we were a nuisance from the moment we sat down. They refused to assist with blue cheese stuffed olives and had to ask several times for a side of olives and blue cheese so we could stuff a couple ourselves. How can you claim fine dining and not have blue cheese stuffed olives for martinis? Ok that was just the tip of the iceberg. Did not get bread until main course and several requests. Not once did anyone refill our glasses of water. I actually had to get up myself and get the pitcher of water to refill our glasses. We topped off our own wine glasses every time. Our table was a mess. Plates wouldn't get cleaned off unless I asked. And don't order a cappuccino because it's definitely asking for too much. We are advocates of local fine dining but bad service can definitely ruin the overall experience. Dissapointed"", ""Salt Cellar\n550 N Hayden Rd.\nScottsdale  AZ 85257\n\nCompanion and I arrived for a 5:00 dinner reservation just a bit early. We were asked to wait in the bar  which would not have been a problem except that every seat was already taken with people waiting. After a short wait  we were seated at our table. \n\nThe bar waitress arrived quickly and took our drink order - 20 year old port for myself and a pink squirrel for companion. The port was a Graham and was excellent  and companion loved the pink squirrel. It is notable that the bar has a large stock of premium single malts  ports  and other spirits. Best of all  they have a bartender that has knowledge of what is being served and knows what he/she is doing.\n\nWe started our dinner with a bowl of chowder - Manhattan for companion and New England for myself. The chowder had lots of clams and potatoes in it  and instead of being thick and goopy (is that even a word?) it had a nicer  thinner texture that was very enjoyable.\n\nNext came an order of Steamed Mussels. They were satisfactory except that many of the shells did not have a mussel in them. Our waitress made things right very quickly by bringing us a steaming hot new order to replace those. The mussels were cooked perfectly and came with a broth and a melted butter cruet to dip them in. Best of all  the mussels were totally clean with not a drop of foreign material in them.\n\nNext came the salad  perhaps the only weak point in the meal. Two problems presented themselves - first was that the salad itself was either torn into small pieces that were hard to get on the fork  and other pieces were too big to be put in ones mouth without being cut up. The second problem was that we selected the house vinaigrette  which just really wasn't to my personal taste. Not wanting to be a complainer  I ate the salad and accepted it as part of the experience.\n\nThe main course arrived next - baked stuffed lobster. Each lobster was stuffed with a mixture of crab meat and scallops  then covered in bread crumbs and baked. The lobsters are smaller ones - about 1 ¼ pounds I would guess  but after the appetizers and the salad they were more than adequate. The lobsters come with a candle heater with drawn butter in it. I prefer a good salt butter to eat with my seafood  and somehow  miraculously  a small packet of Maldon Sea Salt appeared from my purse to help with the butter. The lobster was delicious and nicely cooked. Our waitress  when serving it took the hard parts apart for us so the eating it was simple and non-messy. \n\nOur only unfortunate part of the evening was that we were seated next to a buffoon cardiologist that insisted on recounting his latest surgery experiences to his table in loud enough tones that the entire dining room found out about his sutures. I did not allow that to affect my appetite though.\n\nService and cleanliness were excellent as was the food.\n5 stars"", ""I think I have eaten here a dozen or so times.

The bartenders are always attentive  even refilling my wine glass when it was getting low  and they have wonderful recommendations if you need them. We got the oysters on the half shell and wow those were tasty! My husband said they were the best he's had! We also got the flash fried scallops and they were amazing. The chips that came with them were not my cup of tea- a bit tough for me but my husband enjoyed them. We also got fish and chips  which again came with the same chips as the scallops  and the fish was super flaky and fresh. We took our time and enjoyed every morsel of food.

Upon being seated  we ordered a bottle of wine. At that time  we also had a few questions regarding the menu. Our cocktail server informed us she would not be able to help. After our server opened our wine  she also told me to wait another few minutes before we could begin asking. Our entire dining experience was this way. Our server was snappy and had zero personality. We asked if she would mind taking a photo of us. Both came out blurry and with her finger in the photo. It was apparent we were not a priority and she did not want to be around us. However  considering the restaurant had few tables I don\'t understand why. She quickly moved us through each course  even asking to take my boyfriends plate as he was eating. When our main dish arrived (blackened halibut  and stuffed lobster) it was Delicious but once again she attempted to speed us through that as well. I\'m not sure as to why  considering the restaurant had two more hours left until closing. By the time our meal was completed and we were finishing our wine 4 different people asked if we were finished drinking. It was obvious we were slowly sipping our wine and chatting. However  one lady even asked if we wanted another bottle before we were close to done with the first. Our bill was nearly $200.00. We were not cheap customers in the slightest. My boyfriend still tipped this woman 20 percent which she clearly did not deserve. On the way out the door the host asked how was your meal. We answered ""okay"" and she said  ""alright goodnight"". Salt Cellar only gets two stars because their food was delicious. Their service on the other hand was majorly lacking. I pray no one gets our grumpy server.', ""I was so hoping this place would rock.  The ambiance was great  the service was great but the food was meh.  We went up and took advantage of the happy hour menu. We tried five different apps and everything was bland and lacked seasoning.  Even the shrimp San Remo which is supposed to be a customer favorite was lacking in seasoning.  I was so disappointed.  Was thinking of going back with the wife for her birthday but if the apps were this lacking I'm not spending that kind of money on main dishes just to be disappointed again."", 'I love love love the steamed clams.  In fact I love everything I have ever tasted here.\n\nThe bar is a perfect date spot.  Candle lit and quiet  with great appetizers and stiff drinks.

If you're having a hard time deciding on an an entree  stick to the specials  as it's always fresh."", 'I read other Yelp reviews before coming here and ordered accordingly: Shrimp San Remo and Stuffed Lobster. Both are very good. Shrimp San Remo is in a buttery  garlicky herb-filled broth with a slightly spicy aftertaste. The shrimp are average-sized - not too big  definetly not too small  and surround large chunks of portabella mushroom. \nFilet mignon came out cooked to perfection and King crab legs are enormous and cracked tableside by your server  as are lobster claws. \nThe lobster is stuffed with a bread mix that contains king crab and scallops. The scallops are whole and a little over an inch in diameter. I counted two. I felt that the stuffing was a little over-the-top as it detracted from the lobster itself  which IMO should be the star of the plate. But that doesn\'t mean it wasn\'t good and I would recommend it to anyone going to The Salt Cellar for the first time  I just might not order it next time. \nSome other Yelp reviews mentioned a ""musty"" smell - I didn\'t notice this at all. As in  there was no smell. \nWe had a five-star experience with excellent food paired with top-notch service with genuine smiles and friendliness all around. However  I have to dock a star for veggies and bread. They\'ll charge you a couple of bucks extra for bread to go with the shrimp  which I found odd as clearly  you need something to sop up all that tasty flavor. And the steamed veggies on the plate (zucchini  cauliflower  carrots) were obviously from a pre-cut frozen bag. The dinner salad was bagged  too - the iceberg blend that Dole carries  right down to the skinny carrot slivers. I mean  this is kind of a high-end place  so I wasn\'t digging that at all.', ""Got the king crab....expensive as hell but best meal I have had in my life. That is a death row last meal for sure ;) Environment...eh. Not a fan. We were in a tiny  white walled  white table clothed room. Three tables surrounded us.

I had the Wellington and OMG so good. Tender and cooked to perfection as well. Our only issue was a very annoying and loud couple next to us  who came in at the end of our meal and made sure the whole restaurant knew they were there.

Right away I told the server that it was our 1st time there and that we drove from Surprise to Scottsdale just to try out their food.  I ordered the clam chowder as a starter.   Holy cow was this bad.  Progresso has better clam chowder. The chowder was super watery and was not hot at all. We then talked about the menu and I ordered the baked stuffed lobster.  She really didn't spend a lot of time with us  but that's because she was super busy  and I can appreciate that.  Anyways  the lobster came.  She asked if I wanted it cracked and I said yes. She literally cracked the lobster with her bare hands.  Is this normal?!!  But that wasn't my concern  my concern was the lobster was soooo disgusting. It was cold  chewy and had zero flavor. The stuffing was dry and tasted like a bad stove top box. The scallops inside the stuffing had no flavor and chewy. I didn't even taste the supposed crab in the mix.  My fiancé tried it too and he said it was horrible so I know it wasn't just me.  She came back and asked how everything was and she could tell by the look on my face and offered a new dish. I went simple and got the grilled shrimp.  Which was pretty good. BUT I didn't drive 35 miles for some grilled shrimp. I was so disappointed.  She offered me my bday dessert and I got the lava cake.  Another disappointment. It was cold and nothing special.  I am super bummed I picked this place as there were so many other options.

When we told our server he offered to bring some lemon butter sauce.....how about offering to take it back and have it prepared correctly. Only after insisting for a replacement did he take it back. After removing the empty bread plate  never offered to bring us more bread.

Our waiter passed by the table several times while our water glasses sat empty. He eventually refilled them after clearing the plates from the table....a little late at the point. The cocktail waitress passed by and saw our sparkling waters were empty and brought us new ones. It would have been nicer to have refills during our meal.

The smell of fish was a little too strong for my liking  but I covered my nose and walked in.  The smell was not too bad at the dining area.

Its 1.5 lbs  but you don't get as much of the crab.  My friend got the Salmon  and it was pretty solid too.

First  it is underground which is a little disconcerting for some.  Wine list  by the glass  is reasonably priced with a very good selection.  Not sure if they are correctly preserving their wine though as we had at least one that wasn\'t ""right"".  Some of the fish is exquisitely fresh  but that is offset by some that is not and a lot of fish and shrimp are farm raised.  The lobsters in the tank were showing stress with tails out flat which is never a good sign.  Salads were pretty bad with just iceberg lettuce.  The broccoli was very undercooked (think chain saw).

The tuna and the halibut were being heavily pushed. Four of us ordered halibut and one of us ordered the tuna. All four of us agreed that the halibut was gross. It looked malformed as if it wasn't even real fish and it was very dry. It also was very bland. The Cous cous was a mound of mushy pasta balls  not even really couscous. The bread was cold and dry. One of my friends told our waiter twice that she didn't like the fish. He ignored her both times and even asked her if she wanted to box it up. I guess he didn't hear what she was saying? None of us complained about the food but I hope to never be back to this restaurant again. Also I was in danger of walking to my car at night in this area because it's shady  there are barely any streetlights and there were two or three wayward looking homeless people milling about in the dark.

I was fine with that  since I only wanted an appetizer and a glass or two of wine.\n\nThe Appetizer I wanted was the infamous shrimp san remo. I was intrigued with it after seeing it on their website  then people raved about it here. All my expectations were met  it is truly decadent with a sauce that bounds with flavor. The bread is a perfect accompaniment to dip in the san remo  especially the ciabatta  which was excellent.\n\nThey have a good wine list  I started with a chardonnay  the Diamond T  which pairs perfectly with seafood - a little pricey at $12.50 a glass  but apparently it can range to up to $100 a bottle  so actually a great deal. The best chardonnay I've had in a long time! I also had the David Bruce pinot noir  which was well balanced with a pleasant array of berry notes  yet still quaffable  and a great way to close the evening.\n\nI only gave it 4 stars because I have yet to try an entree  which I will since I will definitely return. Go just for the san remo and treat yourself."", 'My grandparents came into town from Florida and wanted to go to dinner. Their absolute favorite food is seafood and being that they live in a place where great seafood is available everywhere  I wanted to take them someplace that would not disappoint. Anytime I have ever asked anyone where to get good seafood at in Arizona  the answer has always been The Salt Cellar.  \n\nI want to start off by saying the service staff in every aspect was stellar.  We showed up with one more person than we had anticipated and the hostesses were quick to make the last minute accommodation. The ladies in your bar were so sweet  and our server was amazing. \n\nIn regards to the food  my sister and I ordered oysters on the half shell  which were the best we have ever had. My mom got the crab stuffed shrimp and really enjoyed it. My sister and I also split the crab legs and filet. Unfortunately  this is where things take a different direction.  Crab legs were great  but the medium filet was not seasoned at all and was chewy.  My fifteen year old son got the filet and shrimp.  He liked the shrimp  but said the steak was not good  and he usually likes  and will pretty much eat everything with no complaints. My grandfather\'s fish was overcooked  and my grandmother\'s fried shrimp was soggy.  We had cold veggies on our plates that tasted like they were warm at one time  but had sat out for quite awhile.  \n\nLet me just say  money is not the issue here.  Our bill was 317 dollars after tip  for an average of about 53 dollars per person. Totally reasonable for a great meal. When it comes to amazing food  service and atmosphere I would pay double that.  I do realize this is a seafood restaurant  however for the amount of money that is being charged I would expect to leave feeling that EVERYTHING was amazing.  I originally thought about going to The Keg which is similarly priced. I have ordered different steak and seafood dishes there many times and each time said to my husband  ""Oh my God. I loved every part of that dinner!"" However  I wanted to take my grandparents to a local restaurant and not a chain restaurant that they could go to anytime in Florida. After hearing the great things about this restaurant  I decided to take a chance and go here instead. I was honestly SO surprisingly disappointed and to be frank  embarrassed that I suggested it. It was just  eh. Everyone left saying ""It was ok  but not great."" My mom and sister who also live here said it was totally not what they had expected. \n\nI did not want to tell the server about this in front of my whole family when he asked how everything was  not to mention we were in a hurry and could not have had our dinners remade at that time had they offered. So I decided to return home and email the manager. In her response she just proceeded to tell me that the issue is their food supplier and not the preparation. She made absolutely no attempts to regain our service. I would have given this restaurant at least three stars but after receiving her reply bumped it down to a 1.', ""My cousin and I took a drive out to Scottsdale from California and Every time I'm in Scottsdale it's a must that I visit The Salt Cellar  I always have good service but it's just good nothing special  however this time around was different Alex was our server and I cannot even begin to describe how phenomenal Alex was  I mean really above and beyond doesn't even amount to his extraordinary service...my main concern is obviously the food and really that's all I care about but with Alex he was so sweet so attentive and really cared about our experience you could tell...My cousin and I no longer cared so much about the food we just enjoyed his company at one point I just wanted to ask him to join us...he really made us Feel like friends/ family yet he never fell short on his professionalism...All in all Alex really made our experience such a memorable one and I can't wait to visit again...Soon....oh and the food was great too! :)\nP.S -Salt cellar you caught a good one hold tight to that Rod.\n\n-cleopatra"", ""I have gone to the salt cellar since 2005 and used to rave about it. Tonight the service at the bar was terrible  the worst experience I've literally ever had in a restaurant. The bartender did not make eye contact or acknowledge me for 5 minutes with only 2 customers at the bar. The bar wasn't wiped down and a bottle of bleach or cleaner was on top of the serving area. Once she made her way to me she had no personality and did not smile. She may have just rolled out of bed but it was clear she would rather be anywhere but here working. She brought me the wine in a dirty glass and did not offer water or bread which she did for the other ladies near the register. I had to wait awhile and she brought my food over - never brought the bread out after I had asked. As 4 more sat down she said hello without any enthusiasm or smile. I would do yourself a favor and drive a half mile to Kings Fish Market at Tempe market place for the service. How millennials work in the service industry and expect tips for lack of service  hospitality and efficiency is beyond me."", ""Fabulous service. It was my first time coming with long-time regulars and I was told the staff here are amazing. Our waiter had a great sense of humor. The staff as a whole were very attentive without being overbearing. \nClassic seafood fare is on the menu. I had the Ahi and it was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Get the couscous as your side- it might be the best couscous I've ever had. I wasn't inspired by the side salad or the veggie sides  but they were fine. \nYou're given your choice of free desert for your birthday  which was lovely. We had the amaretto cheesecake and the chocolate lava cake and they were both excellent. We took home a lot of leftovers  too. \nThe lighting is dim and the tables are classically set up. It's a very traditional date-or-special-occasion ambiance. My grandparents have gone for their anniversary and my grandma's birthday for the past five or six years and although I'm more of an adventurer  I understand the appeal."", 'I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday last month. He loves seafood and last year I took him to Ocean Club which was outrageously expensive with mediocre food. So I thought I would try something different and took him to SC. Totally pleasantly surprised!\n\nWe had two drinks each  he had the stuffed lobster and I had crab legs. Both entrees came with potatoes  veggies and a side salad. They brought out bread and butter before  and for his birthday a free piece of Snickers cheesecake at the end. The food was DELICOUS... and a lot of it. Neither of us could finish it all.\n\nThe bill ended up being about $85  and I was shocked  expecting way more. Very happy about that!\n\nThe atmosphere is fun  its all underground with a cool little bar. You can dress up if you want  but you could also go totally casual. I like having that option.\n\nI will definitely return and have already been recommending this place to a lot of my clients. 5 stars!', 'I had to go with 4 stars because its just so expensive. Had we known about the great happy hour menu in the bar  we would have ordered there. All our food was very fresh...oysters  shrimp cocktail and ceviche. Will definitely go back for HH.', 'My friend and I went there for happy hour. The bartender introduced himself and continued to call us by our names for the entire evening. Shows that he pays attention and wants to make people comfortable. In addition  he mixes great drinks. We ordered 4 appetizers and shared. Fresh blue point oysters on the half shell  so fresh and big. Shrimp cocktail with really big shrimp. Again  everything tasted so fresh. Shrimp toast was yummy and softshell crabs were a winner as well.', 'This is a quaint little place and fun to go to once just to say you have been.  The restaurant itself is very unique.  Tiny from the outside and underground eating.  It was great to go celebrate our anniversary there.  The only thing is that the food was a lot bland.', 'These reviews are insane! This was the best seafood restaurant I have EVER been to in my life.\nOur server was the best ever! I wanted to try scallops for the first time  but didn\'t want to waste my food if I didn\'t dig it. She brought a ""sample"" for me to try... and it was amazing . The Blue Point Oysters were HUGE and so great! Oysters Rockefeller was awesome. The thing I noticed was the HUGE amount of food you get! Not only do you get your main meal  you get a salad  a veggie and a starch. I will absolutely be back here!!', ""We went to the salt cellar on 9/26/18 . This is literally my favorite restaurant and we try to come often. However I will not be back. I ordered the lemon caper halibut and took half of it and some vegetables home. Later that evening I went to heat up the leftovers only to find a maggot in it. Awesome. Now I wonder how many maggots I ate while at the restaurant? \nCan't do it . \n\n 9/30:\nBefore I could even respond to the message from The Salt Cellar through my Yelp account I received this on Facebook. I feel not only is this completely disrespectful but this establishment doesn't give any care into making a situation right or taking care of a customer. Disappointing to say the least. The maggot looking worm came out of the vegetables. I'm well aware of your seafood practices and the care that is taken  which is why I frequented the restaurant. \nDefinitely never going back now and moving forward. This is not okay.\n \nLet me just add the MULTIPLE times that I did not receive an appetizer or side of crab legs that we ordered  and there is always an excuse rather than an apology...and yet I forgave and returned to the restaurant. Unbelievable"", ""I've been to the Salt Cellar a few times a very long time ago. This place hasn't changed at all. Small parking lot and a lot of people park on the street. Lots of street parking too. So you walk down two flights of stairs to the bar area and the hostess stand. Very small area with a few cozy dinning areas. Dim lights and romantic setting. All adults and no kids. \n\nWe started off with the New England Clam Chowder. It's a huge bowl with lots of clams. Really good and the complimentary bread was so good and soft. Very fresh. We also had the Calamari skewer which came with four calamari on a stick with two different dipping sauces. Calamari was cooked perfectly and not too chewy. It was good not not great. \n\nSo with your dinner you get a salad. I was thinking this was a small dinner salad but no this was a huge salad. A normal salad but with the chowder  calamari  and bread. We ordered way too much. 3 out of the 5 people in our party were full after the salad. It was way too much food before our entree. \n\nAnyways  I ordered the Salmon Wellington. The salmon was wrapped around spinach with a nice crusty outside. The salmon was moist and good. It came with a small baked potato and mixed vegetables. Nice meal and lots of food. \n\nMy wife ordered the Mahi-Mahi with macadamia nuts with a baked potato and grilled vegetables. Like I said before she ate so much she had to take home her entree. Same thing with my son. He ordered the New York Strip with baked potato and grilled vegetables. \n\nMy daughter had the Turtle soup because she never had this before. Black soup and I stole a bite and it was pretty good. She really liked it. They gave a little shot glass with wine in it where they burned off the liquor and you pour in the soup so it's not too thick. Like I said she loved the soup. She also had the Salmon Oscar with asparagus. She gobbled that down and didn't complain so I guess she really liked it. \n\nThe service was great. They had multiple people serving you by clearing out the dishes and always filling your water cups. Very nice and friendly. Very helpful. \n\nIt was a really good with lots of food  good food  great service  and a really romantic ambiance. Just remember to be careful with the appetizer. So much food but well worth it. I enjoyed it. Very different with the underground restaurant. Enjoy."", 'Good happy hour prices and fresh seafood. Nothing to write home about but a better choice than spending your whole paycheck at Eddie Vs or wildfish for okay food', ""Pricey I suppose  but an awesome ambiance  and excellent seafood.  A great place for a date.  A little crowded  but that won't stop me from eating there."", 'East coast seafood in a land locked state.  Drinks are small but the San Remo shrimp  raw oysters  mussels and shrimp cocktail are divine.  This restaurant is underground.  Worthy of four + stars!', ""Since we had been planning to go here  I've been reading the various reviews.  \n\nI was a little nervous  because many people mentioned it being a very small enclosed dining room where the tables are practically on top of each other...I am claustrophobic  so I became quite tentative about that.  I was pleasantly surprised to find it not as small as I assumed.  The restaurant is basically 3 areas: the bar  the main dining room and a smaller dining room--each separated by a wall and windows.  The main dining room (where we sat) did have about 12 tables.  There were some that seemed close to each other  but there were also a few private booths and other tables.  We sat at a separate table  and didn't feel like we were on top of anyone near us.  \n\nOur server was Tony  who was quite knowledgeable about every question we asked.  He was also very friendly and quite attentive.\n\nNow onto the food...It was outstanding!  The bread was quite large  but so soft.  We ordered iced teas (the only part of the meal we didn't seem to enjoy)  and they're flavored.  I prefer just plain.  It had a strange lemony flavor that I couldn't quite put my finger on.  However  that was a very slight hiccup along the way.  For our appetizers  I had the Maryland crab cakes  which were divine.  They were practically all crab  something that I'm not used to with some places that serve crab cakes.  And  they were served with a delicious dijon mustard sauce.  My husband got the New England clam chowder  and if we weren't in a restaurant  he would've licked the bowl.  He loved it!  We had the salad  I had the Italian/Bleu cheese vinaigrette and he had the Thousand Island dressing.  They were fine  nothing too exciting  but good.  For our entrees  I had the Beef Wellington and my husband had the Shrimp & Filet.  I had never had Beef Wellington before  and I'm glad I had it here.  It has become one of my favorites.  The beef was so moist and tender  and the pastry wasn't sweet  but had a wonderful savory quality.  My husband kept raving about the shrimp and the cocktail sauce  plus he said that the steak was cooked to perfection and melted in his mouth.\n\nWe were so full  we didn't have dessert.  Overall  it was an amazing experience  and we will definitely come back for more."", ""Ok  great martinis and blue points on the half shell were fresh and flavorful.  Service in the bar was spectacular.  Service was equally spectacular in the restaurant.  Salad with creamy tarragon dressing was phenomenal.  My lobster was over cooked and my wife's smelled of ammonia.  She sent it back and opted for the halibut which was also over cooked.  We may go back to see if it was a bad night or ?.  Lots of good reviews so I have to assume it was just a bad night."", ""Compared to other seafood places  this place is good but friggin' expensive.  Compared to other seafood places in Phoenix  it's friggin' awesome but still friggin' expensive.  It has been a couple of years since we've been there so I can't say how the place is now but the seafood tasted fresh and the service was good (though not great).  With tax and tip  we spent a good $150 there and I think only ordered one drink.  The restuarant itself is kind of neat.  You go there and all you see is a parking lot with a door and three walls.  The restaurant is actually underground.  I think it's worth going for special occassions  especially since it's so hard to find good seafood places in the valley  IMO."", ""Salt Cellar...The Speak Easy of Seafood!!!\n\nI love Salt Cellar.  Maybe that is because I have been going there for 30 years now and grew up eating there sea food.  Or  maybe it's because it is just the coolest seafood place ever!\n\nYou walk in and it's just stairs heading downstairs to the underground bar and restaurant.  As you walk up to the host/hostess you pass by the live lobster tank and take a look at which one you are going to feast on later.  Or  you walk right past the host/hostess and head straight to the bar.  Such a cool bar  solid wood and very classy  old school Charleston Era / Speak Easy vibe.  They have a decent happy hour in the bar with a pretty extensive food choice on it until 7pm.  In fact  lately when I go  I typically sit in the bar and order Happy Hour items.\n\nThis is one of those places  if you haven't been you have to check it out just to say you've been there."", ""San Remo shrimp and halibut cheeks!  Our anniversary dinner there last night and it didn't disappoint.  Drink service was a bit slow  but food service prompt  cheerful and helpful suggestions.  Only possible downside is that the tables are small and very close  so if you want to have a private conversation  this is not the place.  That said  our neighboring diners were friendly  but not obtrusive.  Will definitely go back."", 'Hello to all my fellow foodies :)\n\nHere it is 2 years after my first experience and for some odd reason I chose to celebrate my birthday again at Salt Cellar.  I was really craving some seafood and at the time I forgotten just how poor the first experience was....so.... a group of us met at the tiny overcrowded bar area.\n\nWe were allowed to bring our appetizers to the table and still pay the ""happy hour"" prices... I though this was decent of them.\n\nI was craving scallops and asked more than once if scallops were in season  as I know there are certain times of the year when such items are ""in season"" therefore providing a fresher delicacy.\n\nThe one thing I really enjoyed the last time was their bread... it was crusty and soft and absolutely delicious.  I was told the bread is the same as it always was....NOT!\n\nDont tell me what you think I want to hear!  The bread was NOTHING like it used to be....this time is was simply ""bread""....nothing at all good or special about it.\n\nAfter many appetizers  we were served our salad...again  nothing special..very basic  except for mine... I guess I got the birthday surprise... a long hair attached to a piece of lettuce! DISGUSTING... \n\nI showed the waiter who was very professional about it and seemed almost embarassed.\n\nThe group of us tried several items.  I got the scallops...after being assured they are in season and very good... Why do I bother to ask  when I know they cant say something like ""oh no...dont go with the scallops  they are small and not really the time of year for them"" and you\'ll regret it!\n\n\nThese small morsels were overcooked and rubbery and lacked any flavor!\n\nA couple people got surf and turf and the steak also lacked any flavor/seasoning and was not cooked to was was requested.\n\nThe lobster  I was told was o.k but nothing to rave about.\n\nWe experiemented with some shrimp toast which I really cant describe because I am not sure what it tasted like other than salty...couldnt not detect the shrimp taste.\n\n\nI returned my scallops and after the hair and rubbery food had no desire to try anything else.\n\nThe owner had come over to the table and apologized for the ""series of events""  his excuse for the hair being that due to the ventilation system hair and partical will fly around... (which of course has to land somewhere...why not my salad) \n\nThey removed my scallops from the check....duhhhh any mediocore place would do the same.\n\nI would like to give a special THANK YOU to our waiter.. my apologies for not remembering your name  but he was terrific!  Friendly  quick and when we needed him...he was around.\n\nWe got out of there with what I feel is a HIGH price to pay for such a distasteful experience.\n\nWhen I got home and after hearing my friends give their critique of my choice of restaurant to celebrate at I was pretty unhappy!\n\nI felt the owner  although a nice man  did not care enough about his customers to do something a little ""above and beyond"" to apologize for the experience and try to keep a customer.\n\nI called the restaurant and spoke with the owner and told him I was very dissapointed and felt that he should have done something more than make excuses.. he kept apologizing and I assured him none of the 5 of us would every return to Salt Cellar.\n\nHe finally said he would like to do something for me and asked for my address.\n\nHere it is a couple weeks later...not sure why he wanted my address...maybe he is gonna picket my house or send mean letters...who knows... he never did anything!\n\nIt is clear to see why his restaurant is not packed as it was years ago....You may have the repeat business from those who have been patronizing your establishment from back in the day when your food was actually good  or there were no other options for seafood...but guess what?  There are other options!\n\nAt this point in my review I usually suggest you go and try for yourself...but this time I am going to save you the time and money....GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!\n\nYou will be glad you did.\n\nAs for the owner of Salt Cellar....apologies and excuses are simply words....Stand behind your restaurant...you should have wanted to prove to me that you do a better job than was we experienced.\n\nYou are cutting too many corners to save money and it is costing you your customers!\n\nYour actions speak for themselves!\n\nIt used to be when you mention Salt Cellar people would ooohhh and ahhh...those days are gone  most of the people I mention it to have no idea what Salt Cellar is.\nThat speaks VOLUMES!\n\nAnd so I say... Bon Appetite\'', 'I worked at the Salt Cellar for over 11 years and I recently started a new restaurant job in Sacramento  CA. Just the other day a table of mine caught wind of the fact that I just moved here from Scottsdale and immediately said  ""My favorite restaurant is in Scottsdale  It\'s called The Salt Cellar!"" Needless to say I was extremely proud to inform her that I had spent the last 11 years of my life working at her favorite restaurant. Now with that being said I feel like I need to make a couple comments about a few of the reviews I just read...\nWhen you go to dine at The Cellar you need to know that it is more than a restaurant  it is an experience. Most people choose to come for special occasions like birthdays or Anniversaries. By the way  they offer a complimentary dessert for those occasions. Most people can not afford the luxury of dining at a pricey restaurant regularly although there are plenty of regular customers that dine there. In my opinion you get what you pay for and if you want to eat FRESH seafood in the middle of the desert  you are going to pay a pretty penny for it. Go to the coast if you don\'t like the gas prices it takes to ship fresh fish in on a daily basis. The food there is pure. By that I mean it is not spruced up with glazes and sauces to mask the true flavor of the fish you ordered. Some people may think that is bland. But I think if the chef masked the fish with other flavors  he might as well buy it frozen. My last point about the price is  there is no a la carte. When you order an entree there it comes complete with a salad  bread and two sides. I have seen people leave the place leaning forward because their full bellies wouldn\'t allow them to stand up straight. \nThere is a review stating that the place is not kid friendly because they don\'t carry high chairs. Well  personally that is an incentive for me since I don\'t have kids and would rather not listen to them scream while I\'m enjoying my dinner. However  they are very kid friendly. The owner has two beautiful granddaughters who have been dining there since birth. And if you happen to get Cara as a waitress she will probably take your child on a tour of the restaurant to give you a break while you enjoy your meal. It doesn\'t get much more kid friendly than that!\nIt may seem like my opinion is a little biased  but I have nothing to gain from this review other than spreading the word that this unique little gem of a restaurant needs to be experienced by you. If you are questioning whether or not to dine there based on the past reviews then please take this one into account. It\'s a unique and unforgettable place. It\'s privately owned by a couple that care about every guest that walks in the door. If you don\'t like your dinner  do yourself and the restaurant a favor and say something. Your server will get you a new one or something different. No questions asked. They want you to walk out the door happy as much as you do. \nOne last thing  in my opinion the best item on the menu is the Alaskan King Crab. Not only is it mouthwatering delicious. Your server will crack it table side for you!', ""'ve been here four or five times with my wife. The wait staff are some of the best in the city. They are usually right on. The best mussels I've had since my sister-in-law's house in Brooklyn. The seafood tastes fresh and well seasoned. My wife had one bad dish there. The waiter could tell by her full plate she did not enjoy the crab cake entree. He promptly apologized and took to meal off our check. I will be back. No restaurant is perfect but they handled it with class. Kudos for running a business the right way!"", 'Well  I\'m sad to say that the Salt Cellar has official went down the drain.  I\'ve been going there for years and years and the past few visits have gotten worse and worse with this past visit the one that broke the camels back and I will never return.  It started with a cold attitude from the hostess  the fun kept going with very bad service at the bar before dinner   (we were virtually ignored for 10 minutes after sitting down)  the mussels about made us sick  the bread at dinner came out as three big slabs of under baked dough  the salads were just thrown together with vegetables that were old   I sent my $40.00 filet back as it was the worst steak I\'ve ever had (the waitress said it was the third one she returned that night!)  ZERO seasoning and over cooked.  I mentioned it to or waitress who said ""well its just over cooked around the edges""  REALLY!!  They may want to replace everyone in the back as they obviously don\'t care what they put out.  My girl friends steak and crab legs were bad as well.  And then to top it off  desert came out and it looked like something my 12 year old son put on a plate. Also  it was so cold in there  everyone was complaining and nothing was done until we were ready to leave!!   Not sure if they have new ownership/management but with all the good restaurants in town they will soon close their doors with this kind of service/food.  \n\nAgain  sad to see this place circling the drain .. but it was a good run.', ""Do people in AZ not know what good seafood is?  I went here based on the decent amount of good reviews.  There aren't many seafood restaurants in the Phoenix area and I've always been curious about this underground place.  First impression was this place looks like going to my grandma's house for dinner.  The decor was old  smelled musty  and it was dark as hell.  I thought the food here must be phenomenal to carry its other shortcomings.  I was wrong.  EVERYTHING was overcooked.  Calamari  halibut cheeks  ahi tuna all overcooked!  Why would you overcook Ahi?!  You don't have to worry about food poisoning from undercooked seafood here.  Clams were steamed so it was hard to overcook but they didn't use any seasoning.  I could have cooked that at home.  Looking around it seemed like the only people who still come here and think this place is good are the senior citizens.  We were the youngest ones eating there on the saturday night.  I'll end this review on the positive note.  The carrot cake was good."", 'Love the happy hour here!! Mussels  little necks  oysters you name it', ""Best seafood we've had in Phoenix area (been going here on and off for 20+ years). Old landmark type place.

FYI  it's underground so little to no cell signal and they ask you not to use them."", ""WOW!!!! I am SHOCKED that this place has managed to maintain such a high rating. My husband and I went here for our anniversary  Walking in it seemed like a unique place with a unique atmosphere. I could not have been more wrong. \nWhen we were seated in the dining room we immediately noticed the dated decor. The yellow lights  and brass picture frames with pastel ocean scenes. It was like they haven't changed a thing since the 80's.We were berated by three different people asking us for our drink order when we first sat down  which was not only confusing but annoying. \n\nwhen looking at the menu we noticed there was nothing under 40$ which is fine I will gladly pay for an AMAZING meal. I ordered the fillet and Alaskan King Crab legs...I am going to emphasize legs here.\nMy husband not being a seafood fan ordered the 14oz boneless Rib eye.\nNow where to start  Our meals came with salad  vegetable of the day  and your choice of a baked potato or rice pilaf. First the salad was Iceberg lettuce but despite that their house dressing was still decent. Now onto the meal Our plates came out and I was SHOCKED and HORRIFIED  My 40 dollar meal consisted of a child's fist sized baked potato  which incidently was the best part of the meal  a pile of vegetables  zucchini  cauliflower  and black olives...yeah think about that for a minute  they where BOILED no seasoning and inedible. My fillet was tiny which was fine I was not expecting a huge hunk of meat  cooked perfectly but had NO seasoning and tasted awful. What a waste for that cow that sacrificed his life to be cooked in this place. Last but certainly not least my Alaskan King Crab leg... yeah that is right ONE leg. When she sat my plate down I just started laughing I could not believe I just wasted 40 on this. The server said wow that's a leg as if I was getting some deal. My husbands meal had the same problems no seasoning and boiled vegetables. Give me a break this place is a joke! I have never payed 100.00 drinks not included for food that was so terrible. I have no clue how this place is in business and I will scream it to the mountain tops DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY... Unless of course you like bland inedible food. Go to Red Lobster you'll have a better meal at less money. And that's saying a lot  I try not to eat at chains..."", 'Went here for happy hour last night  Sean has been talking about this place for 2 years and we finally made it in!! happy we did! The winding staircase downstairs to the host desk was interesting  and the restaurant overall was really tiny  but we LOVED the happy hour!

We looked on yelp to see what people recommended and the Shrimp San Remo was definitely worth a try! We also got the fresh bread to dip in the sauce! YUM!

When you celebrate birthday dinner once a year we wanted it a little less rushed."", ""Went in on a Thursday night with a group of about 20 people for our holiday work dinner. The restaurant itself is very unique. I love that it's a very small building at glance but when you first walk through the door you go down a wide rustic wooden staircase and the restaurant is located completely underground. Unforuntiley there is no elevator so keep that in mind. It's a medium size restaurant with 2 small rooms and a large bar. You can hang out in the bar area while waiting to be seated. \n\nThe servers were good! We had 2-3 servers for our large party and additional food/drink runners periodically. Everyone was super friendly and knowledgable of the menu and any questions we had. We were seated at 2 large tables and one of the tables got their food and finished eating before the other table got their food which was a bummer. We had ordered at the same time too. I know it was a large party but that should have never happened. Luckily with the appetizers  bread  and salad we were patient enough to wait for the meal without starving. Not sure if there was a mix up in the kitchen but the servers never addressed that.\n\nThere is a ton of menu options for everyone to enjoy. So even if you don't like seafood there was many other great options such as steak and teriyaki chicken. It is a bit pricey but i feel it's fair to the service  portion  and quality food you are served. \n\n*** All lobster and crab options are cracked and cut open table-side which is awesome. So don't fear the pain of cracking those crab legs because they do all the work for you!! ***\n\nEach entree is served with bread rolls to start  salad  veggies  and baked potato or daily starch. They had some interesting salad dressings to choose from. I went with the tarragon dressing. Honestly  I hated it but it was because it tasted like mayo to me. But that could be totally a personal preference so I just set it aside because I knew I had plenty of other food coming! \n\nFood I got:\n- Appetizer shrimp cocktail was delicious. Served with 5 huge jumbo shrimp and a flavorful spicy cocktail sauce.\n- Surf and turf with 1.5lb lobster and 7oz filet mignon. It was all incredible. They serve the lobster with a lemon butter that was delicious and the steak was cooked perfectly. Had a great char flavor. \n\nOverall I was satisfied aside from the huge delay in food being sent out.

There's another Mexican fast food place opened up by Kew Gardens and they're very  very  good.    I wanted to say something positive ......I was happy that there was corn added to my veggie quesadillas. However  this is not what I would consider gourmet.

My wife and I really wanted to like this.  We want to find good Mexican  but the guac was so bland and whipped it needed a Gerber label on it.  It spread as easy as margarine.  The chips were over-fried flour tortillas.  Being over-cooked made them very greasy.\n\nThe fish tacos were also very oily and tasted surprisingly fishy.  It was a large piece of fish  but it was burried in a massive cascade of vinegary cabbage.  Still  it was not specifically bad  just not very good.\n\nThe carnitas were dry  dull and flavorless.  There was a large amount of meat  but since it was not enjoyable eating this taco quickly became a chore.\n\nThe most flavorful item of the menu was the quesedilla.  It was  however  dripping with oil and soggy.  \n\nWe ended up throwing most of a nearly $50 meal away.

I stick to my tried  tested and true half chicken tinga  half chorizo burrito combination.  All burritos come with rice  black beans  pico de gallo  and shredded cheese  add an extra 1$ and you get satisfyingly creamy guac. \n \nThe Argentinian Empanadas with Chimichurri sauce are also a solid choice  but if you want to be gut-busting full opt for a large burrito  it will never disappoint! The Beach location is super quiet to eat in  and in nice weather you can grab your food to go and enjoy close by Kew Gardens.', 'There was a lack of ""burritos"" in The Beach for the longest time  now they\'re springing up all over.

The chicken tinga taco was delicious and perfectly topped. It was the first taco we had  so it set the bar high for the other two. The chorizo taco was dry and definitely missing something. It had a drizzle of guacamole and a whole lot of chopped red onion on it. When we had the beef taco  we were disappointed because it was also dry and lacking. We asked for the chipotle aioli they put on the chicken tinga taco and the guy at the counter happily gave it to us without a charge. The taco salad was alright. A lot of cheese and not much else. The salad comes with guacamole for you to dip your taco shell in  but I really wasn't feeling the taco shell or guacamole. Their guacamole is way too smooth. I'm used to it being chunkier. The texture kind of reminded me of baby food.\n\nService was friendly. We were their last customers and dined in  so when we were finishing up and ready to clean up after ourselves  the guy at the counter told us he would do it for us  which was nice."", 'Excellent Authentic Mexican Food with very friendly service!

I had heard of 'fish' tacos before but had thought yuk.  But this was awesome.  What's not to like about beer batter fried white fish.  Was really good.

Perhaps some Latin or contemporary Mexican music might be better."", ""One of my favorite places for fish tacos.

My friend needed to pee really badly so we walked in and she went straight for the bathroom while my other friend and I looked at the menu. She was then yelled at by an older man (who we assumed was the owner). \n\nIt was not busy at the time and the yelling was really distracting and rude. He said the bathrooms were for customers only. My other friend decided to buy a drink (as the friend who has to pee didn't want one because she NEEDED TO PEE). This didn't work and the man again yelled at all of us to leave. I guess we assumed that if one person bought something  one person could use the bathroom. I guess not. The whole situation was not only awkward for us  but for all the other people eating in the place. \n\nA young woman did apologize to us for the rude behavior (which was sweet) but I think it's safe to say  that we will never eat there.

I know there were a lot of people and she was rushing  but she was kind of sloppy and throwing them all together really quick. I think if she took her time a little more and put a little more love in making them  that they would actually be better. The best part about the crepes is the menu.

I would of liked more powdered sugar and more micro basil. But  it was decent.', ""The crepes are good. The kids shared the nutella and bananas while the wife and I shared the bayonne.

Surprisingly  the wait was fairly short.  I ordered the crepes suzette(oranges aplenty) and my gf ordred the favorite(strawberry and raspberry). Both were very tasty  should satisfy those with a sweet tooth. Keep in mind  if you order something with fruit  use the napkins as you might get hard-to-clean berries on your shirt or skirt  as my gf found out.\n\nThey didn't serve full coffee  which I think they should(lattes  mochas  etc.) to complete the crepes experience. My only real complaint is that the seating is limited and shared with the bakery next door. For the value  though  a great meal at roughly 20 bucks for two.

My daughter and I gave this place a try last Wednesday.  Our wait in line to order our crepes was less than 5 minutes.  We waited 8 minutes for our crepes to be created.  They have a nice mix of savory and sweet crepes.  I went with the Monte Cristo and my daughter did the Blueberry & Lemon.  Both were very good  I think I would have like to have had a little more strawberry jam spread over my Monte Cristo  but some how I managed to survive.  There was plenty of seating around the area  but I could see on a busy morning you may want to think about taking these to go since seating would be limited.

It was recommended to me and my boyfriend by a friend of ours for when we visited Veags. Or friend was right. We got a breakfast crepe and a dessert crepe and loved them both. It was perfectly cooked  with the perfect amount of sweetness in the dessert crepe. And the breakfast crepe was so savory. It's in Ceasar's Palace so it's just a matter of finding the Little Paris food court. And the tables are first come first serve  so beware if you are going at a busy time. It might take a while to get a table but these crepes were with it. Also the lady working the register was super nice  she warned me before I ordered that it would take at least 15 minutes.

We were already full but there was no way I was going to let this go to waste. We ordered the crepe with cinnamon apple filling  topped with caramel and creme. And  when I say creme I mean to say C-R-E-M-E. It's a wallop of real whipped cream; maybe a bit too much. It also melts quickly so be sure to not order it at the same time as the savory crepe. Next time we'll get up and order it separately. Anyway  back to the crepe. Again  yummy goodness! I had never had a crepe with apples before. It was like apple pie hooked up with a Frenchman. Perfection! Even though we were stuffed  we licked our plate clean. This is a definite must-visit when stopping at Paris Las Vegas. I look forward to it in the future.\n\nAdd'l notes .... seating is a problem. This is not a restaurant. Seating is available next door to the crepe stand but on a busy day  it can be tough to find seating. Have one person stalk out a table while the other is in line getting the crepes. While the crepes run $10 a pop  soda is about $4 and it's for a small ... very small ... 16oz cup. The drink prices are not posted on the menu so it's a bit of a shock when they ring it up and you'll be too stunned to say anything.

I had looked at the menu the night before and knew that I had to decide between a savory ham & cheese crepe and a more sweet blueberry lemon crepe.  That morning I was feeling savory and so I went over to find a seat in the seating area while my girlfriend did the ordering.  Due to that I don't really have much to say about the place itself since I did not see much of it.  My ham and cheese crepe came out to me looking nice and covered in a béchamel sauce which I mistook as cheese.  The crepe was pretty tasty as ham was good and salty which paired nicely with the Gruyere and it quickly disappeared from my plate.  Whenever my girlfriend had also finished her crepe we started talking about ordering a sweeter crepe for a dessert of sorts.  My girlfriend decided to spoil me and let me have both of the crepes that I had thought looked good the night before by deciding to split the blueberry lemon crepe with me.  She once again went over and ordered and came back with an amazing looking plate.  The crepe was in the center covered in a berry sauce  blueberries and powdered sugar with a Chantilly cream on the side.  In the middle of the crepe was some lemon curd which gave the dish some sourness that worked really well with everything else that was sweet on the plate to keep it from being too sweet.  In the end there was nothing left as we both had enjoyed our meal.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  While I believe that it is a bit overpriced to enjoy on a regular basis  the food is great and it could easily be a nice little treat every now and again."", '3.5 stars for this place. Nothing fancy here  almost like fast food as it shares seating with a pizza place and something else. I had a ham and cheese crepe and it was pretty tasty. Quality ham and quality cheese.

Hit the spot though as I was hungry.\n\nVery nice and friendly lady working the cash register.', ""A friend recommended this little crepe place in the heart of the Paris food court  and now I just have to recommend it to you!  If you're lucky  you won't have to wait in line too long  but it's totally worth it.  Have a friend grab a table at the nearby open cafe.  Freshly made crepes  both savory and sweet  are just what a girl needs to keep up her gambling strength.  My favorite is the Fruits de Mer crepe (seafood crepe).

I went w/ a friend and we shared one savory and one sweet.  The savory had shrimp  scallops and some bechamel sauce over it.  The sweet was the Napolean which had raspberries  blueberries and strawberries w/ some lemon custard and a delicious raspberry sauce drizzled all over.  Both were amazing and hella tasty.  \n\nIf you want a get away from the endless buffets in Vegas  you have to try this place.

It wasn\'t worth the drive and the hassle to get there. Locals park free at Paris btw. And to top things off I got lost going home  took several wrong turns and ended up circling the airport.

I was able to try several varieties with the spinach and artichoke being my favorite  although I do wish there were larger pieces of artichoke and spinach in it.', 'When in Paris  do as Parisians do.  When in Paris Las Vegas  stop by La Creperie.  \n\nI come here a few times a year for a quick  casual breakfast.  Notice I didn\'t say ""cheap "" because that\'s one thing it is NOT.  $8.99 a crepe is a lot of money.  I guess they have to pay for their charming location on Le Boulevard inside Le Casino.\n\nLa Creperie only offers food for takeout  although there\'s a charming seating area to the left of the stand.  Go with a friend and have him or her save you a seat.  The seating area is pretty small  and you might have to get creative about getting a table.  The crepes are made to order  so get ready to wait 4-5 minutes for your order.\n\nSince I have to order two of everything  I opted for two crepes: one breakfast crepe and one dessert crepe  They offer 6 breakfast crepe choices and 6 dessert crepe choices.  I went with a St. Louis crepe (pronounced ""sen-loo-WEE "" like the Tampa Bay Lightning player  not like the city in Missouri) and a Peanut crepe (no pronunciation tips necessary).  \n\nThe St. Louis had prosciutto  cheese  basil and was drenched in bechamel sauce.  The sauce was thick  but a bit mealy.  Actually  now that I think about it  it looked pretty disgusting  kind of like milky cream of wheat.  The crepe was very tasty and filling  though.  The second crepe  the Peanut was chock full of chunky peanut butter and bananas.  I would have called it The Elvis (in loving memory).  The Peanut was very sweet  but it still made for a pretty good dessert.  It\'s not the best dessert crepe out there  though.  Berry and fruit crepes are much better.\n\nPiece of advice: skip the coffee.  It\'s too weak and taste-less.  I saw people walking around with Starbucks cups.  If I hadn\'t been so lazy  I would have stopped by a Starbucks before ordering my crepes.  Starbucks is not very Paris like  but . . . you know how they say that Seattle is the Paris of the Pacific Northwest?  Well  they don\'t really say it  but they could.', 'La Creperie is located in Paris Las Vegas  looks like sidewalk Creperie in the street of Paris.

It bit pricey but I cannot resist this place.', ""This was alright. I'm a huge crepe fan (nutella and fresh strawberries are my favorite!) but was a little disappointed by their lack of selection and menu options. They couldn't make me a nutella strawberry crepe (no strawberries??!! say what??) so I opted for the nutella with banana which they overdid with  caramel sauce and nuts but it was decent and we ate it all so I can't complain too much. But seriously  how are you not able to be flexible with ingredients? Was asking for strawberries really such a hardship?"", ""The crepes were okay.  I've had better savory crepes.

I personally ordered the ""Roasted Chicken"" and it was pretty decent. Spinach and artichoke  Tomato Mozzarella  and Cinnamon Bun were pretty good too. My personal favorite out of all the crepes that me and friends got was of course the NUTELLA. So  if you\'re trying to go for something filling and somewhat healthy  get what I got (Roasted Chicken).

The setting is nice inside the Paris  and the service was ok. \nThe wait times were a little long  but we were there at a slower time  with 3-4 people waiting in front of us and it was about 15 minutes.

I find it to be unacceptable service when I pay for food and tap water is not available free of charge.  Furthermore  if you are going to charge me for a cup  it would have been nice to give me a full size cup  rather than a very small one  which I had to refill multiple times.  I asked if I could have the larger cup instead  and the answer was a firm no.  I understand that they want it to be plastic  so that it is see-through  and more difficult to steal a drink other than water  but make it a bigger size.

The creperie is a tiny operation with a front person taking orders and two cooks. It is attached to much bigger bakery  the Boulangery.

They also have juices and coffee  everything you need for a quick brunch or bite to start off your day. Its not a formal restaurant so the only tricky thing is that it doesn't have formal seating. It shares the seating area with other eating places around the area so once in awhile it might be hard to find a seat but the few times I've been there I've never had a problem.

The lemon blueberry and apple are our favorites!"", ""I f-ing love this place.  It's where we had breakfast   well  three of the three mornings we were in Vegas.   I prefer savory to sweet crepes  unless they're just buttered and sugared....  I'm a less is more kind of a gal.   This place is truly top notch in my book!  They're huge and well  maybe it's 'cause I'm from downtown Chicago... but I don't find $9.99 for a crepe than can feed two to be at all over priced."", ""For the price  the portions are pretty decent  however after watching the chef make a few orders its clear that most of the crepes' fillings are pre-made and stored in large containers. Its probably not a big deal  considering this is basically an Americanized fast food version of a classic French staple. What do you expect?"", ""Had the breakfast crepe and it made me sick. The bechemel was good and creamy but I think the egg just got me. Stayed in the bathroom for a good hour. Service sucked. They first gave me my Buddy's crepe. And they gave me some one else's plate when they realized they made a mistake. Tables weren't as clean as I hoped. Overall worst experience of my Vegas trip."", ""Average food but a big plus for speed and price when you have somewhere better to be.  Half the people seated there were speaking French  so it couldn't be all that bad  eh?"", 'Expertly cooked crepes  reasonably priced (for the Vegas strip) and a good way to start your day. Coffee is adequate  service is counter-style  so you have to linger while they cook.

(On a trip to Colorado we ran across a fantastic little place that sold the most amazing hand pies and we ate 16 hand pies over the course of 2 days.)\nSo  that's pretty much what happened here at The Creperie.  Less than 18 hours in Las Vegas and we had already tried 5 crepes.  Yum  yum and more yum.  They are so light and eggy and the fillings (ham and cheese  shrimp scampi  roasted chicken and asparagus   caramelized pears and butter...sugar and butter) are such high quality ingredients that the finished product is just amazing.\nSo  we have laid off the crepes for a day now but I can already see more in the next few days while we are here."", ""I love their crepes.  For a tourist  this is a great stop for a fast breakfast and lunch.  Dinner is also possible but I wouldn't recommend it.  It's not filling enough.  This is also a great spot for a snack.  You can never go wrong with a crepe.  \n\nIt's inside the Paris Hotel and Casino.  They have some chairs and tables.  If you have a big group and want to put all the chairs and tables together  be prepared to be using your muscles  if any.  The crepes range from dessert to a gourmet kind.  I've had the Nutella flavored crepe  Berries crepe  and also the omellete.\n\nIt's so much better than fast food  even though you get it fast."", ""Best savory and dessert French style crepes! ..if they get everything that's supposed to be in it that is. Crepes are BIG  can be shareable  fairly priced to me. \n\nThe crepes themselves are super buttery. I could eat it with just the homemade chantilly cream and I'd be happy  but why stop there? I go for the nutella crepe without bananas. Have asked it with strawberry a few times and have gotten it with it twice; sometimes they'll say yes  most times it's a no lol. The hazelnuts are addicting. The fresh berry crepe is also a good choice. They don't lather the crepe too much with the strawberry compote  then you got the fresh blueberries and blackberries on top. That big dollop of chantilly cream will be gone before you know it.\n\nGoing the savory route  anything with the bechamel sauce is good imo   because that sauce is just luxurious. Do try the shrimp scampi and roasted chicken  you'll find yourself craving it at times. Sometimes they skimp on the shrimp though..\n\nOrdered the roasted chicken crepe during a busy time and they completely forgot the bechamel sauce.. without it the crepe was so dry and bland. No biggie though  told them there was no sauce  they handed it to us on the side and we got more bechamel than had they put it on.\n\nSometimes it's really busy   sometimes it's not  but you gotta be patient for sure. It'll be worth it."", ""I ate here on my last night at Paris hotel. I didn't have time for a sit down meal since I had to go to the airport soon. I wasn't expecting a great crepe since if seems like a fast food take out place. The servers also barely interacted and they just looked tired/bored. \n\nI ordered the monte cristo . It was a sweet and savoury crepe. It's filled with ham  turkey  and Swiss cheese  topped with strawberry jam and sugar. I found it a bit too soggy for my liking. They poured way too much jam on the crepe that everything started to taste the same to me. I felt like I'm just eating a crepe with jam. I could no longer taste the ham and cheese. Maybe I would be more satisfied if I stuck to something less creative like a common breakfast crepe. I didn't enjoy my crepe at all and the service didn't make my experience any better."", 'Without the Creperie we would have died. The line for the buffet was so long at one point we actually got in it  I went to get coffee and then we said ""screw escalation of commitment..we are out of it"" then we found the Creperie. I only ate one the entire weekend  but then again I wasn\'t in Vegas to eat. My girlfriends however.. spent more on crepes than gambling. Good times  good food. I loved the one with the ham and the Bechamel sauce. They have sweet and savory depending on what time of day it is.. ha ha. It doesn\'t matter what time of day it is  \'cause it is Vegas  and even if you are a stay-at-home mommy with two kids.. you can go to Vegas for a weekend and stay up all night long two nights in a row  partyin\' like a RockStar and sustaining yourself on crepes and champagne. Thanks for getting married Nancy!', ""C-R-E-P-E-S!! \n\nOne of my favorite places to go eat in Vegas is here!  I love crepes and this place satisfies my cravings. \n\nWhen in need for good food quick  come here (only during the non rush hours and non-holidays week).  They don't have an actual restaurant.  La Creperie is a food stand that has a large kitchen.   It is located in Paris.  You order the food at the cashier and just wait for your number to be called.  \n\nMy favorite crepes:  St. Louis ( prosciutto  cheese  basil with bechamel sauce) and the Napoleon (Lemon Custard with Raspberries  Blueberries  and Strawberries).  We also ordered one that had salsa on top  but I can't remember the name.  It was also really good.\n\nGood crepe:  Toulouse.  It taste like a Calazone. \n\nAll the crepes cost about $8-10.  The portions are HUGE.  My 3 sisters and I shared 3 crepes.  It was very very filling! \n\nCons:  When you go during a holiday week  expect the wait to be LONG.  We went during Christmas week and it literally took us about 40 mins just to order and get the food.   However  when I ate here during a non-holiday week  I got the food instantly (10 mins).  Also  there is a seating area right next to the stand  but finding a table and chairs is INSANE!! Honestly  it's like a whole new world... you see the ugliest side of a person.  There's so much tension and hostility when people are looking for a table and chair.  My family was lucky enough to find a table but just trying to get one more chair took 20 minutes.  Also  while you're eating  you can feel and see people lurking at your table and ready to grab your table once you are done.  It's like a jungle.  *Survival of the Fittest!*  However  please remember that I went here during Christmas week.\n\nOverall  I totally recommend this place!"", 'Berry crepe was sweet goodness.  I ate the whole thing all by myself.\n\nNeed I say more?', ""Came here to catch a quick bite before taking the family to see the Nutcracker. It's a small shop along their faux street where you order at a counter  wait for your food  then hope you can find seating. Our order was up in about 10 minutes and lucked out by grabbing a tiny table to eat at. Between the three of us (2 adults and a kid) 2 crepes were plenty filling.\n\nSt. Louis ($9.99) - imported ham and mozzarella and fresh basil with bechamel. The description mentioned imported ham. Maybe they meant imported from the local grocery store  because the ham didn't taste any better than what I get at Albertson's. The bechamel sauce was too thin and runny for my liking.\n\nToulouse ($9.99) - ground sausage  pepperoni  sautéed mushrooms  mozzarella  basil  topped with marinara. This was the better of the two that we ordered. Tasted just like a pizza. The marinara lacked the depth in flavor that would make it special  but was good enough to satisfy.\n\nThis might be a good place for a quick bite  but definitely not some place that I would seek out or ever crave. The portions are ridiculously large  so share."", ""I used to love coming here when the prices were cheaper. I remember I was in Las Vegas one weekend and they were one price then came back the next the prices went up 2 dollars!!! That is ridiculous. I haven't been since. \n\nMy favorite savory crepe was one with seafood in a creamy white sauce. My favorite dessert one came with Nutella and I always added bananas. I don't think people know that you could customize your order.\n\nI would of suggested this place when it was cheaper. Not sure if it's worth the two dollar raise in prices. Also  since it is just a window front  you have to look for your own table. That area is by the bathroom and it's always pack. So I don't think it's worth the effort paying the price you do and then having to stand around waiting for a table and most likely having to bus it yourself. The way they serve the crepes is on a plate and you definitely need a fork and knife. You can't just pick it up and go and eat it like an ice cream. Someone needs to open up a crepe place just like it  fix all the problems and I know they would make a killing."", 'The crepes are pretty good  but I\'ve got nothing to compare to. I\'ve never had a crepe before now! lol\nLe Creperie offers 7 savory and 8 dessert crepes  all made in front of you. Takes about seven minutes from order to plating.\nThey\'ll pack it to-go if you want. \nSome of these are crazy rich--my husband\'s cinnamon bun crepe was so sweet I just couldn\'t take a second bite.\n\nFour stars and not five because:  \nA-the checkout staff were not very friendly; I dunno..I guess I just wanted them to be smiling and interact with us  but maybe after doing this day in and out  they get jaded..? Especially the cook wearing the huge poofy white chef\'s hat--he looked like a character you\'d want to get a hello from. \nB-there just isn\'t a large selection of crepes. I thought we\'d go and see double the options...or maybe just a mix and match option..? I just now saw that their website suggests you add ice cream or other add-ins/mix-ups  but these items/options are not listed anywhere around the venue.  \nC-they used processed meats in some of these...my ham and cheese crepe had sliced lunch meat in it--for their prices  and for a place that calls itself ""French inspired"" I feel that actual ham should be used. \nD-they really use brand name Nutella. There was a massive jar of it behind the counter. That disappoints me. Nutella is ""just ok"" to me..it is pure sugar. Why not try something like Justin\'s brand of hazelnut spread? It\'s different because of the lower sugar content. My grandma would say it\'s because we Americans are used to a crap ton of sugar.', ""The location is a bit busy and maybe a bit of a mess at times  and they definitely need some better seating  so that's the missing star.\n\nThe food  however  just wow. I had the butter and sugar crepe and it was beyond delicious. Everyone in our group ordered something different and we shared some bites. My husband had the scampi and my mother had the monte cristo. Both excellent. \n\nWe have been meaning to stop here for several trips and we are glad we finally did  and bummed we didn't do it sooner."", 'I\'m a fan of crepes  so my husband and I tried La Creperie in the Paris hotel.

We ordered the ""Favorite Crepe""  which has blueberries  strawberries and raspberries in a raspberry coulis  and the ""Bananas Foster Crepe""  which has bananas sauteed in dark rum. \n\nThe crepes were served on a fairly flimsy plate  which was okay  but the plastic knife and forks were ridiculously small (the cheapest you can find  you know the ones I\'m talking about). I\'m okay with disposable utensils  but the ones at almost any fast food restaurant are better. Each crepe came with a generous scoop of whipped cream. I tasted both flavors  and they were both okay  but not great. Also  the crepes got cold rather quickly.\n\nI might try this place again if someone recommended a better flavor and I brought my own fork.', ""I enjoyed the meal. I didn't think i would like crepes  but they are quite tasty. \n\nOne drawback  the lines are ridiculously long.

There is plenty."", ""I ordered the St. Louis (ham  cheese  and basil) savory crepe.  Unfortunately  I wasn't impressed.  My crepe was too thick and the ham was all where the fold of the crepe was.

Mmmmm custard in a sweet crepe is a must!\n\nI came here because I remembered in from five years ago and wanted to see if it was still there. Lo and behold  it was in the exact same spot.

I have heard from reputable sources that French ppl are not the most gregarious of folk  but sheesh.  Would it kill ya to smile?  Third  our Napolean (lemon curd/berry) crêpes needed more curd.  There was only a teaspoon or so of the curd which translates to too many naked  dry crépe bites.

My favorite thing in the whole world is a delicious crêpe. I just love them. My husband and I made it a point to stop in and have a delicious crêpe while visiting in Las Vegas. I don't know if that was this particular day or what it was but they were very expensive and definitely not worth the trouble we had to go through to have a HARD yet enormously chewy gummy unsatisfying crêpe with berries and whipped cream.

The crepe was a little soggy and too thick for my liking. The raspberry sauce was too tangy I had to counteract it with whipped cream. I've had good raspberry sauce and a little tang is good  but this was too much.

I\'m sad because the price of one individual crepe sky rocketed to $9.99 each compared to back then  they were like $7.99 :( I know  not a big difference  but two dollars can change a life you know.. ANYWAYS I can\'t believe that this place is hidden inside none other than Paris. It\'s right across from that long ass line for the buffet  but why wait when you could conveniently get it to go right? There are some ups and downs to the crepes though. I haven\'t tried all of it  but if you like something that tastes like potpourri  then get ""The Favorite"" which is I think #1 on the menu. It\'s a combination of random fruits which over powers the crepe itself. I honestly don\'t like it :( If you want something as a dessert  I suggest you get either the Nutella  Chocolate or Suzette. I know for sure that those are yummy  but I have yet to try the others  so if you want to be adventurous and try something else  then hell  go for it! :) My last comment for the evening is.. the Fruits De Mer  also shortly and casually known as ""Seafood Crepe"" -___-.

Since it's morning I decided to have a ham and cheese because who doesn't like ham and cheese. Along with water it's a pretty healthy meal.  The size of my Crepe was not huge but it was fairly big and full of ham.   \nAs we waited for our crepes I will admit it was a fairly long wait but hey its Vegas what do you expect.  After finally getting our crepes we looked for a place to sit.  About the only downfall to this place is the fact that that there are definitely  not enough places to sit.  We walked all around the area without a seat to be found. So we saw a tall table and decided what the heck let's just stand and eat.  I will say standing and eating can actually be good because I didn't feel as stuffed.\nAll in all this place for me was worth the wait. The Crepe was perfectly cooked with the right amount of food to get you going.

Now  when they say ""topped with a caramel sauce"" they actually mean: ""3 skinny lines of caramel  carelessly scattered across your plate and crepe""\n\nIt was delicious though. The pears were canned  which at first  i was against  but then as i was eating it  i came the the conclusion that they were perfect because fresh pears would\'ve been too hard. these still had a nice bite to them though  they weren\'t soggy. The almond paste gave a sweet  smooth  nutty blanket in the background.. it wasn\'t over powering with almond flavor.\n\nThe boyfriend ordered The Favorite. which was also a sweet crepe  stuffed with all types of berries (blueberries and strawberries come to mind  but i know there were more) topped with a berry sauce. It was very tangy  which complimented the sweet crepe perfectly.\n\nThe down side to this place  is the line. You order  and then spend 15-20 mins (depending on how big the line is.. more or less.) standing off to the side  waiting for your number to be called.

We wanted a couple ingredients taken off of a crepe and she snapped back with it being the same price. We stated that we were aware of this and she instantly cut us off mid-sentence. I\'m not expecting Disney World-esque customer service  but at least pretend you enjoy your job. I would say maybe she\'s had a bad day  but this is not the first negative encounter we\'ve had with her and upon reading other reviews  other people have had negative customer service experiences as well. \n\nThe only other negative would be price. I\'m not too concerned with this as we expect nothing less being on the Las Vegas strip  in a tourist trap. They running at about a 21% food cost which is equitable to a bar  not a cafe. Elsewhere  the exact same product would be closer to $7  we spent $10.50 per crepe. \n\nAgain  I would recommend trying their crepes.

I thought that for the price  it was just average.  It tasted fine  but it should be priced 2 to 3 dollars lower.

First time we went  I had the crepe with spinach  mushroom  and cheese  topped with a bechamel sauce. It was awesome! My husband got a crepe Suzette  which he enjoyed.  Second time we went  we got the nutella crepe.  It was good  but it was almost too rich.  It was only nutella on the inside and topped with whipped cream.

I was there for dinner on Sunday 8/12/18 at about 6:30.\n\n(Disclaimer: I am very much a meat and potatoes person  but I did venture out to try a few things that looked good  so this isn\'t terribly comprehensive food-wise.)\n\nI really wasn\'t planning on eating here  but as I had to go by the casino anyway (I collect casino chips...yes  I know)  I decided to check it out since it had just opened and I had read good things about it.\n\nWait wasn\'t long  maybe a dozen groups in front of me. Would have been faster  but a party of 10 was haggling with the cashier about whether or not a coupon could be used for everyone or just one person. Not sure how that turned out for them  but it held things up for a while.\n\nVery nice surroundings  quite bright and nice. Seating isn\'t too cramped  pretty average for a buffet really. Service was good  I was there on Sunday night and while it was full  they seem to have enough staff on to do a good job. My guy  TJ  was pleasant and helpful.\n\nSo  food. Fair amount of choices cuisine-wise  but it\'s not based on origin  rather how things are prepared more or less. There\'s a Hearth section for things like pizza (which I never eat at a buffet  I\'ll go to Pizza Rock if that\'s what I want) and such  a Carvery with the usual meats  a Wok This Way section for Asian cuisine as opposed to separate nationalities. There\'s also a Healthy section that I avoided just on principle alone  and I\'m not much on seafood  so you crab leg lovers won\'t get much from this.\n\nI tried a few things from the Carvery naturally  along with a couple of other things. The best things I had there were the rotisserie pork  very juicy and flavorful and the spare ribs as well which were nicely smoked and tender. The brisket however  which I was looking forward to  was really dry although tasted pretty good  and the fried chicken was bland. The hot links were links alright  but not all that hot and needed some seasoning. That was true with most things actually including their mashed potatoes and the potato salad; if they had added some seasoning to them  even just some salt and pepper  they would have been better.\n\nI did have a tomato and cucumber salad which was really good  and the fruit was nice  the watermelon especially. Desserts were very basic except for the ""build your own ice cream sandwich"" option which sounded good but looked really tough to eat.\n\nAll in all  the term ""You get what you pay for"" comes to mind. I paid $15.99 with my Boarding Pass member card and left TJ a $4 tip. Just remember that this isn\'t the Wynn or Caesar\'s buffet and you may be OK with the basicness of Feast. What would work really well is if you knew there were one or two things you loved there and could stuff yourself on those for $16.\n\nI doubt that I\'d go back  but it wasn\'t bad based on the price and I got my chip!', ""Great location  great buffet  great food and great service.you just can't go wrong dining at the palace station feast buffet."", '$7.99 with a players card.\n Hamburgers made to order are okay.

I'd live off just those two."", ""My husband and I went for breakfast and enjoyed the buffet for $6.99. Very cheap! Good food selection for the price. The omelette bar was the best. But the cheap price comes with slow beverage service and ghetto people. When we were in line to get into the buffet  two ladies tried to cut after getting out of line and buffet staff ignored it. And in the omelette bar a lady cut in line to join her friends  I politely asked her to get behind the line but she refused  I dropped it because she did not look too friendly. I've had better quality and variety food at Vegas buffets but certainly not for $6.99. Overall  the food was good!"", ""The newly remodeled Feast Buffet was my first experience ever at Palace Station  so I was able to go into this completely fresh.\n\nThe ambiance of the buffet was great. Color scheme  lighting  and overall feel was top notch. \n\nThe food selection (breakfast at the time I went) was fantastic. I couldn't believe some of the stuff they had. They had different types of Boba drinks  and horchata  which both blew my mind considering I never seen them before at a buffet. Everything I had was fresh  and tasted great.\n\nThe service was pretty good. The service at the omelet station was fantastic. The man that made my omelet was Tony and he knows how to make a killer omelet. \n\nOverall this was a fantastic visit and might have found my new favorite buffet in town."", ""I paid $6.48 for everything in the breakfast buffet with drinks so I'll expect a buffet worth $6.48.

There was no line to wait in this weekday morning - making me think this might not be well known. After we were seated - the server came right over and took our drink order. The buffet selection for breakfast was excellent ! They had an omelet station  dessert bar with donuts/danish  salad bar  and many of the usual items such as chicken fried steak  bacon  potatoes  sausage  pancakes  waffles  etc. Everything we had was very good ! We ended up going mutiple times during the week for breakfast. The price was very good and Wednesday is Senior Day where you get breakfast for half price if using casino credits to pay. This turned out to be a great breakfast option while visiting Las Vegas !', 'Wow!!!!! This remodel is amazing!!!! Probably the best buffet I have been to. Everything was great! The food  service  selection. I even had a shrimp pasta made fresh for me by the cook Eddie who made it look like it came from a expensive 5 star restaurant!!!! I will be coming back here and telling everyone about it', 'Vast improvement  not to miss items Chicken n biscuit   bbq chicken  smoked chicken   lemon cod  french fries believe it or not. Nice variety on the salad bar  a lot of good options. Not quite as upscale food as Palms  but your not paying the Palms price either.', ""Mother's Day Brunch  complete with Mimosas  Champagne  and Shirley Temples. Sounds great  right?\nIn my personal opinion  the mimosas being strong was the only good part about brunch other than our server being an absolute sweetheart. \nThe eggs were undercooked  prime rib was tough  and the wait was nigh interminable."", ""It's ok.  I had a BOGO coupon.   That's the ONLY reason why I came here.  I got some coupons in the mail for boulder and palace station. I thought the BOGO coupon was good for the boulder station casino  but when I got in line   the cashier looked at the coupon and told me no   it's for the palace station  so I got out of the buffet line  hopped in my car   I drove my happy butt over to the palace station.  The buffet prices there are like $1 cheaper.  With my coupon   I paid $9 for 2 buffets!!  I have another coupon for September.  Overall   the buffet SUCKEDDDDD  it's small and DO NOT SIT IN THE BOOTHS! It's so hard to get up and the seats are NOT comfortable!  Sit at a table instead."", ""The food is warmer this time but the service is terrible.  They also will not allow a President's card holder use the VIP line.  I was told only Chairman cards aare VIP's."", ""Great off the Strip buffet with a quick wait time on a Sunday for brunch. They've definitely upgraded their buffet environment and expanded. The general line went to the end of the rail and took 20-minutes.\n\nHOW CAN I GET A DISCOUNT?\nGet a Station's Player card at the desk over by the Oyster Bar so that you can get a discount at the buffet. However  if you have a Chairman's (...and I think President. Not sure if that's changed) Player's card  then there is a separate line that gets you in to eat in zero to a few minutes.\n\nCOMFORT\nThere are servers to get your drinks so make sure to leave a tip. You can bring your own drinks in from the casino if you'd like. I brought my own water bottle as I always carry one during this hot Vegas summer. The seats are very comfortable whether you are seated on the chairs or booths.\n\nFOOD\nThe quality of the food is good and tasty. I do wish they had a pick your own wok bowl section (where you pick the meats/veggies and then top it with noodles and sauce  then they cook it) just like they have an omelet your way section. The division of selection of foods is clear to see and walk through. I enjoyed the Beets hummus and sausage the most!\n\nI would like to go back again for dinner  soon."", 'I also remember this buffet when it was upstairs.  This new buffet is a thousand times better.  The food stations are new and modern.  More choices for healthy eating.  The different food stations offer a wide variety for any palate.  The staff was friendly and attentive.

The food is closely equal to the Palms.\n  I would recommend this buffet without hesitation.', ""It's not fine dining  but it's great for the price. Get there early for breakfast at the lowest price around (with player's card) and get an omelette made to order. Yum!

Only downside is that the food between lunch and dinner didn't change much so if you like it once  you'll probably like it again. I was pretty good after the first night but didn't really need to go again"", 'I wish you could be able to give a negative amount of stars. This place is beyond horrible. The food is just nasty and the service is worse!!!! I hate giving bad reviews  but seriously  this place is a ZERO.', ""If you're coming here for dinner you need to get there 30 minutes beforehand. There's a lot of people that comes so there's a long line and they do charge extra for holidays other than that the restaurant is cheap. There food on the trays of the best fit are cold. I got a ravioli and the chicken I marinated chicken in it was cold when I got to my table it did taste good though. I do recommend if you go make sure the chef makes you something fresh his cooking is really good on the spot. The desserts was the same as any other buffet  .  They had  little  pastries  it was a cannoli . It was really good ."", ""For anyone trying to compare this buffet to one that is double or triple the price  don't. Just get out your fat wallet and move over the strip. For others of us who want decent value with good  everyday food  this is the place.

They have gone from a place for rats only to a transformed  near chic spot! You won't believe the change. The buffet has moved from the second floor to a light and bright main floor spot. Everything very appetizing. You won't find luxury ingredients  no lamb or crab legs  but that's not the point. It's popularly priced and the food goes along with the price point  but thoughtfully prepared. You can tell that the recipes were really carefully considered for flavor. The Hungarian goulash is superb  the Mongolian beef with onions so flavorful. Welcome back to the buffet map  Palace Station!"", ""A group of 5 guests at the hotel ate here every day during our stay from Tuesday through Friday for breakfast. Service was excellent each day. The food quality was consistent on each visit. 2 out of 5 of the guests are serious foodies  myself included. But even foodies can take the overall situation into account in their assessment of a dining experience.\n\nFor the price  the value was good. Overall food quality was acceptable  considering the low price. Scrambled egg dishes (with or without cheese  mixed with sausage or veggies) were consistently over-cooked  rubbery and about what you'd expect from a typical cafeteria serving large crowds. Hashbrowns  were likely pan-fried from bags of frozen  shredded potatoes  often with clumps of salt on top due to uneven application of seasoning. Bacon was usually crispy. Sausages were bland and mealy. Most of the diners enjoyed the Eggs Benedict offerings  but only if they were fresh from the kitchen. I thought the Mexican station's items were decent  though surprisingly bland. Cinnamon buns were acceptable. Orange and Grapefruit juices tasted like watered-down fruit punch. Coffee was mediocre. All diners agreed that the breakfast pizza was awful. Pancakes were dry and inedible. Waffles were okay. Doughnuts were mediocre. Hand-carved ham was decent.\n\nFor a quick  no-frills breakfast with excellent (and always friendly) service at a low price  it's a win. It will not please those who are in the mood for well-prepared food made with love by passionate chefs."", 'Worst.... Ever food was ok service was the absolute worse the clean plates are dirty when this was brought to the management attention they shrugged it off. The restaurant is dirty and unsanitary trash in the food prep area. We went to the breakfast brunch. Not only did the charge us 15$ each when its advertised 10.99. they then explain its 10.99 with players card they did not give us the option to sign up or look up our card. # which can be done its been done at every other station casino. We where here with a small group the wait staff tells us there is a 2$ per person charge to sit together. We said not no but Hell No so the staff sat our part in 3 different parts of the restaurant separating our 75 year old and 93 year old disabled members from the family. They didnt charge us this fee the previous day. We find it interesting half the employees are wearing pro union badges and the other half anti union. Hopefully real managers see this.

A note to you men who venture out in public thinking that such tops qualify as a shirt - they don't !  Learn to dress. !!\nNot trying to be a snob but a dress code would be nice. \nThe locals business is great for the restaurant but a problem for guests such as myself who need to get in and out quickly. \nOverall  I recommend this place and I eat here often. The selection and quality of the food is good. \nThe biggest complaint and suggestions I have for the management is that they need to do something about the bottle neck at the cashier station. It is outrageously outdated with a cumbersome process of figuring out the various Player Card discounts  checking ID's and an antiquated paper process  etc.  And of course  it seems like every other customer has some issue or complication which takes minutes to sort out.

The Top Round was a little dry and tough  but there were plenty of other meat choices. Some of the side dishes  such as the Hungarian Goulash were on the dry side from the heat lamps but still tasty. The salad bar had all the usuals plus a hummus and pita section with half a dozen flavor variations. The Healthy Section was novel and cooked 'bowls' to order for you. Another highlight was the matcha boba tea (without boba) and sugar rimmed horchata. The gelato was awesome and there was a nice selection of deserts in addition to cobblers and a soft-serve station. \n\nI'm giving Feast Buffet 5 Stars because of the great value for the money. Especially if you have a player's card. The worst part was the 45 minute wait to get in  the best part was the super friendly service!\n\n\nUPDATE: We were so impressed that we went back. The second time however  was not so great. Something caused us both to have stomach cramps and we both had the visit the restroom before leaving.

To begin with  the lighting is awful -- it's bright and stark and gives the area the look and feel of a hospital or school cafeteria.  Food selection is smaller than most Station casino buffets  but looked okay -- sparse  but okay.  But the desserts!!  Ack!!  Talk about sparse!  One of the joys of going to Station Casino Feast Buffets were the pies  and there were no pies!  They used to have the most wonderful coconut cream  banana cream  chocolate cream  lemon meringue  pumpkin  cherry  apple  etc.  but the cooks told us that they're 'no more ' that they now have 'carnival type desserts  like caramel corn' (!) and some silly looking bits of rolled up cake-y things (eek)  and other equally disappointing items  They did have some nice looking carrot cake...but it was in the NSA (no sugar!) category...and what's the point of that when you're trying to be a glutton (excluding diabetic gluttons  of course)??   All of which means that  like the extinct pies  we will also be 'no more' to the Palace Station Feast Buffet  or to any of the Station Casinos that morph into harshly lit environments that don't have our locally beloved comfort food desserts.

There was t a lot of choices and options. Not like other buffets. But at 12.99 with players card what do you expect? Frozen margaritas are only $2! But you can hardly taste the alcohol. Tasted just like a slushy. Haha overall  wait was only 15 mins  food was decent  and service was good.', ""My first day here I was starving so ofcourse I piled my plate full of food and was happily full. The meal is quite inexpensive. Wait staff is nice. Clean setting.\nHad breakfast and I think dinner there subsequent nights and by the last meal I was already bored. But that's the thing with buffets that don't change it up frequently enough. \nFor the price it was okay..def not the best buffet I've ever had."", ""Food sucks!!! But service is good!!! This is the worst buffet that I have ever had! I won't come again even it's free!!"", ""The 4 stars are for value.  This is old Vegas when there were real food bargains.  Definitely wind through the casino and get the Player card for the discounts.  Fancy  no.  Large selection with Chef station  yes.  Best that you have a car or you'll give your savings to the taxi drivers... Many of whom are eating there too!  Does that tell you anything?"", ""This is for the breakfast buffet only  which I had this summer.  Really people?  You're whining about a 5.99 buffet?  Some people are just tightwads that want something for nothing  are fat and gotta gorge themselves by tasting every damn thing the buffet offers then complain about one item  or chronically hating the world.  I had a mushroom and cheddar omelet  breakfast potatoes  sausage and fruit.  All fresh and good and only 5.99!  Sure I could've had another round  but why  I was full and satisfied."", 'The newly renovated Feast Buffet  sneak preview.  Opening soon to the public.  Lots of new items and food stations.', ""This buffet was remodeled amazingly. It has good atmosphere and it's general appearance is appealing. The food options are very diverse for vegetarians and picky eaters. I was happily surprised by the healthy section and boba tea. The waiters are friendly and helpful. Good choice for patrons looking for variety and quality!"", ""Line was super long then found out it's only $9.99 per person if you have a players club card so ended up paying 16.99 per person. It was $9.99 for my 3 and 4 yr old. The food was only subpar and the set up was stupid."", ""This buffet was renovated a few years ago and looks a lot nicer at the food stations with granite counter tops. It includes a meat section  a small Asian food area  very small salad bar and a slightly larger dessert area. They also have a made to order steak option that costs slightly more. You can order hamburgers and pastas made to order as well.\n\nThe buffet is one of the smallest I have visited in Las Vegas and gets really busy during late lunch and dinner. This buffet offers a deal to Taxi drivers  so add extra time to your expected dinner as there are always a large group coming through. Be a member of the player's club to get a few dollars off.\n\nThe food is mostly hot but I'm not sure how often it gets swapped out for fresh food  so I only eat what looks popular to try to ensure some sort of freshness. If you are on a budget and want to take a few friends out to a buffet  try this one at Palace Station."", ""Feast buffets is taking Las Vegas by storm! They r getting so much better each time I m here. And I heard they r also taking over the Palm Casino n is remodeling the Palace Station. Can't wait to try the Feast buffet at the Palm when they finish the renovation. Anyway  the Feast at Palace Starion is stil one of my favorite! There is never a wait. Even though it is one of the smallest Feast buffet in the valley. But it is sufficient to keep U full n satisfy!"", 'Was treated like crap by Viola  she would roll her eyes and question if we were even able to pay! Completely unacceptable. We called earlier and confirmed that they were serving brunch. I record all my calls (work related). When I played the audio and they said it was their casino operator and that its not their fault  I was misinformed. DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU WANT GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE.', 'This is not the best buffet in Vegas  but it\'s certainly the best value. Had dinner here last night  and then breakfast this morning. \n\nNoteworthy last night was the salmon... Really good! There was also roast beef  ham  and all the usual buffet staples. \n\nBased on dinner  I\'d have gone five stars  but breakfast was a bit disappointing  primarily because of the actions of their ""egg nazi"". \n\nWe arrived 45 minutes before the switch from breakfast to lunch  but had to wait 40 minutes on line to get in. I got a plate and went to the \'eggs to order\' station  where the cook was doing a couple of omelets. As I got ready to order  though  I was stopped by a guy in a black uniform marked "" Assistant Room Chef""  who told me ""Omelette station is closed at 11"". I looked at my phone. 11:02. I told him we\'d been waiting 45 minutes  pointed out the cook was still doing eggs and I only wanted a fried egg. No budging him. "" No eggs for you!""\n\nThe only eggs on the breakfast station were old and dried up scrambled eggs  so it was an eggless breakfast. There was also no bacon left  and very little other breakfast food.\n\n I understand they have a changeover time  but if they are still selling breakfast at 11 there should still be breakfast food available at 11.\n\nRichard', ""The good: the Casino  restaurant and hotel look way better! \nThere was a huge selection of things but nothing outstanding that I'd go back for. Exotic foods with bland flavors. Maybe they will get better I will give it a while and see if they get their act together  but for now it was nothing to write home about."", ""This is my third time coming here to eat and the first was back in 2009. The food has definitely improved since then and the staff is always very nice when we come here. In my opinion it doesn't have much of a variety of foods than other Feast buffets but for the price it's not that bad. It's closer to where I live and my boyfriend enjoys the meat and pasta station a lot! He says this buffet is his favorite compared to the others. I just wish they had an assortment of gelato or ice cream but self serve isn't bad too I guess. I also really love their chocolate bars filled with walnuts and coconut! I think they serve that at other feast buffets as well."", '""The Adventure Continues.""\n\nWe\'ll start this review as we\'re standing in line waiting to be seated. We paid $20.00 for our meals which is nice. Being seated went by quick. We were told we would be seated as soon as a table would be available. Now we were told as soon as a table would be available  but half the dining room was empty. Table availability or just understaffed?\n\nFood was par for the course as far as buffets in Las Vegas go. Plain and simple some are better as others. The salads we created were ok.  Fran  my wife  had a cherseburger and a tamales. Both were fine  but the tamale was small in size.\n\nI had a few soft tacos with rice pilaf. Taco meat was average at best. Rice pilaf was bland. I then had a slice of turkey  green beans  mashed potatoes without gravy and cornbread. Again average as far as buffets in Las Vegas go. One item I felt was better than average  the corbread. I had four of them in all.\n\nFor dessert Fran had German chocolate cake and carrot cake.  According to her both were pretty dry to the taste.\n\nI had ice cream  and a red velvet cupcake. The cupcake is so small it only takes one or two bites before it\'s gone.\n\nThe buffet itself is small in size. I felt cramped waiting in line for a table. I would imagine at night during dinner the place to be crowded as well. The serving area is small and easily crowded.  As I write this review Palace Station is undergoing a large renovation process.  Hopefully Feast Buffet will be expanded on.\n\nIn closing I would like to add that I used to work for Station Casinos in the Wildfire devision. One of the service standards is to ""Let them hear you smile."" Seems all but one person forgot how to do this.  Another service standard is called the ""10-5 Rule"".  If you are within 10 feet of a person  smile. If you are within 5 feet of a person   say hello  at least acknowledge the person you are close to. A person who looked to be management forgot how to do this. How about the ""Fond Farewell"" standard? Pretty self explanatory to me. Not to the cashiers as we were leaving  except for the same staff member mentioned earlier. Everyone else was talking among themselves.\n\nOkay I\'ve rambled on enough. You all have a nice day. As a pastor and dear friend of mine says  ""The Adventure Continues.""', ""This was not the best buffet I have ever been to  but it wasn't completely horrible either. It is on the smaller side for a buffet offering up your standard buffet fare. I would compare it more to your local Hometown Buffet than an extravagant Vegas-style buffet. I will say  however  that their meat was on point! I had the turkey and it was so moist and delicious. Others in our party raved about their roast beef as well. Also  the mac and cheese was super yummy (yes  I have the pallet of a 6 year old...).\n\nThe service was really good as well. We had a party of 17 people and our waitress didn't write down our drink orders but brought them all out exactly as we had ordered them! We were all really impressed. My only complaint about the service would be that they didn't clear plates quickly enough. We always had one or two plates in the middle of the table and people just started stacking their new plates on top of their old ones.\n\nThe best part about the buffet? The price! It's typically only $15  (you get what you pay for  right?) BUT  if you sign up for their member points card (which you can do for free) it knocks the price down to $8 a person."", ""They really are trying....  It's a buffet that's not like the Terribles resort and not the Studio B!  Not to say that Terribles buffet is bad as it has some great examples of common food (killer brisket) in a much smaller space  and even Studio B has some misses  but the Feast buffet has been trying to improve its menu and raise the bar for the price.  Way way better than the Hometown Buffatorium!!!!  Prices are now smarter and easy on the budget  and while no changes have been made to the physical area  the foods are different. For breakfast you still have a long line at the omelette station and there's a lot more choices to make throughout. One interesting choice is a breakfast pizza with egg  cheese and basil!  Kids love this one!  My favorite was the chicken fried steak with country gravy... every time they had it  I would serve it on my plate .... Mmmmmm.  Eggs Benedict with the hailendaise sauce separate is a good thing cause you can soak your hashies & piggies if you want instead.  Bacon is king here and there is plenty but I like it limp so too Krispy for my taste.  \n\nLunch and brunch fits better with much more different foods & the carving station has many more choices of meats  and throughout there are more different choices Of deliciousness  with a few hits and misses. Tater tots was one of the biggest hits  as as soon as it was served hot it would vanish and they would have to bring out more where it would vanish again. Same thing for any of the hot pizzas  especially if there were little ones in the dining room  as they would take multiple slices to the table.   The omelette station becomes a pasta station for lunch & dinner.  the carving station in addition to its offerings can grill you your burger  dogs  sausage  roast chicken half  or even add cheese & grill your onion rounds on request!!! One serious miss from lunch to dinner was this one I will call Dead Greek pasta salad  as this salad has a pasta that had died years ago... The pasta was simply dried out and dead of flavor whatsoever... None of the feta  tomato or spices could penetrate that pasta. They kept serving it daily to get rid of it or are displaying it daily like a viewing of a corpse! \n\nSunday brunch was also Mimosa day and many times the mimosas kept flowing  but remember many of the servers wouldn't offer it... You would have to ask for it and when you did they would bring it and bring it and bring it is long as you kept asking for it.\n\nMany nights dinner was a theme night  which made dinner different from lunch  yet there were some dinner foods that were the same as lunch. There  would always be classics  like fried chicken  mashed potatoes  burgers  hot dogs  pizza  salads things like that regardless of theme and the one item I rate most buffets on... And it hold true every time; THEIR STUFFING!  At one time it used to be a wet  kinda gooey mess  but now it's a nice  homemade style stuffing chopped bread stuffing that is very nice.  \n\nWARNING....\nLike most buffets  turkey served in buffets is white meat heaven.  Dark meat consists of usually only the leg.  Asking for dark meat sometimes means they give you the whole leg!  Be prepared for that fact... And be hungry\n\nDesserts were typical pre made but many were different from the ones they had from previous stays even 3 months prior!  Many more lighter fare  doughnut holes  jellos & a way bigger sugar free dessert area.  They also added sugar free sherbets along with the frozen yogurt offerings. I had the raspberry (very sweet) & fresh peach (very good!!!!).  Fresh fruit was available too.\n\nService is great for the most part  even exceptional but every once in a while you get a crabby patty... You will get service  but not the great service Palace Station is known for (they really do treat you like a local friend!).  Come early cause it can & does get crowded & join their rewards club for a discount & comp'ed meals with play. Handicapped guests have their own line with their party.  \n\nMy review is for a 4 day stay  4 different meal services (breakfast  lunch  Sunday brunch & dinner) & 1 dead salad.  \nFYI: They only offer Tabasco for hot sauce\nReview score was more a 3.9 but they are really trying....\nPlease give that salad a decent burial in the desert somewhere.... Please!!!"", ""Went to their newly renovated buffet two weeks back during week day lunchtime  i have to say the place looks very nice  clean and modern. I have never been there before renovation so i cant say if it was a big change. But it is definitely very nice and looks upscale.  \nThe super long line outside (seems like 30+ minute wait ) certainly makes the place look attractive too. Even us at the VIP line was waiting 10+ minutes.\n\nThe workers there are not the most friendly  just OK.  They have similar food to all the other feast buffets. The only good thing about the Asian section is they have BOBA and little horchata drinks! It is got to be the most unique choice i have seen at a Las Vegas buffet place  granted it was just powdered made but it tasted good and looked very nice! \n\nThe Asian food though especially the Mongolian beef  was very dry and EXTREMELY salty.  Do try the cold Soba noodles  those were good and an unique offering too.  \n\nTHey also had a wide selection of hummus  that's also worth a try. \nOther than that dessert options were very minimal   good gelato and good soft serve too. \n\nYou can sign up for their players card and get discounted price  i think it was $8 or $9 for week day lunch. Honestly  the renovation made it look so nice  but the food quality is really only worth $8 and not the full price."", ""Good and cheap!!!!!!! It was pretty basic but everything was good. The pastry chef must be well versed in the culinary arts because that was the best part. This place is on par with Hometown buffet so its not top notch...but you can't beat the price."", 'Soooo wonderful for the price!!! I was pleasantly surprised at the huge array of vegetarian options!!! Everything was tasty too. Had a small stomach ache after but nothing too bad. Will be back', 'I was really hopeful to have found a good cheaper buffet in Vegas. We at here for dinner and half the food was very obviously sitting out for ages. The oriental side was very very disappointing. The Italian was pretty good. Dessert left a lot to be desired. And the apple juice is nasty. Ultimately there was enough edible food that I left full and somewhat satisfied but I would not recommend this buffet at all.', ""Food was average  but considering we had two for one it was just okay.  However  we won't be going back.  The Buffett had a very unpleasant dirty stink to it.  Floors filthy with dropped food  and trash every where but the trash can.  Strong odor of cigarette smoke drifting up to dining area.  Been there many times  but no more  even with a deal.  If it was for free  the wife and I agree no thanks."", 'If youre trying to have good food on a budget  this is the place for you! This place is a pleasant surprise.  Just off the strip  well worth the short drive. The casino/hotel offers free parking. We came on a Saturday of a Holliday weekend  there was a bit of a line to get in  but it moved fast. We were offered 2 for 4 dollar frozen margaritas in line  not strong but tasty. The food was great  I recommend the pesto chicken and the potato scallops. A well rounded hearty assortment.', ""Hands down the best buffet to have in vegas. $9 for lunch? Can't beat that. They have every form of protein you can think of here. If you cannot find something to eat at this buffet  then you are a lost cause. Burgers  fish  chicken  pastas  roast  turkey  and I'm just naming some of the items that were on my first plate."", 'Attempted to make it for breakfast. Got in line 45 minutes before breakfast was over and didnt move very quickly and missed breakfast. Let me add the line wasnt very long. The food was ok for a low price buffet. The server that waited on our table was very quick  very friendly  and had a good sense of humor which is needed when waiting on my crazy family.', ""This has been my 2nd visit since the remodel. Still the food was amazing! The cook Eddie was here again to make me the best shrimp alfredo pasta in all of vegas. The desserts were fantastic and of course the delicious boba tea. Last time I left a 5 star because I had perfect service all around. This time though it looses 1 star. The reason for it is our server. We came in around 8p and i understand they close at 9p but that shouldn't be the reason to neglect your table to do sidework for closing. Our server came to our table once only. We had to find her just to get another water. I'll be back back here again. Hopefully I can raise my review to a 5 star again"", ""I still haven't changed my mind much from the last time I was here but they have changed a few things. You can now add a steak for $5 or 1 lb of crab legs for $6 to your $6.99 buffet. \n\nIt's the standard Vegas buffet  pretty small with so few choices  they do have charbroiled hamburgers and sausages. But they got rid of the hand scooped ice cream & now have the machines which really sucks that was the highlight of this buffet. \n\nThe prime rib was par roast part rubber. .The  chicken and tacos were good overall its not bad for $7  but still I usually only go when it's comped on my players card.\n\nThe service is non-existent here-get your own drinks and they hardly come around to clear plates. However they did redeem themselves at the end with some good coffee."", ""The selection is International  and the quality makes you want to travel elsewhere!  \n\nThe price point is fair for the all-you-can-eat  they have pie (a bonus!)  but the overall quality is equivalent to a cheap buffet.  With that said  that is what this is!\n\nI've been a couple of times at lunchtime for convenience sake  and it's not busy...so it's easy in/out.  But my suggestion  especially if you are vacationing in Vegas and can choose anywhere to eat...choose somewhere else!"", ""At first I was hesitant visiting at this buffet but I was told the food is decent and it's affordable. So I gave it a try. I came here on a Sunday after a great workout. There was already a long wait line and I'm hungry. It took one hour to finally be seated. The first thing I went for was something hearty. Thank goodness they brought out a fresh hot tray of Chicken Parmesan. They have other hot food varieties but I'm a picky eater. There's also a good selection of salad. When I returned to my table I was ready to eat  but there's no utensils  no napkins  not even a drink. I had to wait for a server to come by to get utensils. I can understand how busy it can get around lunch. I know that on Sunday brunch you can get bottomless mimosa but I chose grapefruit juice  and the server I had was quite friendly and attentive in giving me refills. As for dessert  there is only one thing I like that taste good -- Peanut Butter Cookies."", ""ok  but could be better...staff friendly food mediocre....make sure you get your card....I was going to have this buffet a second time after waiting ...I swear like 10 minutes with 2 people in front of me ....one was a family ....get up there realize  i don't have my card left it in car...she says we can get you one and sent me to another line that was like a bus full of italian soccer players 20 people long\n...went to in and out burger .palace station screw's me over again .."", ""I've been here several times. Went again last night. It's good food for the price. Never had to wait in line too long. Very good service. Love the turkey and roast beef."", ""There are several reasons for the 5 star rating and not because it's a 5 star dining experience. I have been coming here for breakfast for many years. The reason is because of the awesomely low price for exceptionally high quality food and bountiful selection of items to choose from. For $6.99 with a player's card it can't be beat. All the Stations properties have undergone renovation with raising the bar on standards overall  so kudos to that. I don't stay here because it's off the beaten path of the strip  but I do rent a car and the drive is simple with easy parking. Also  it's never very crowded because it's one of those Vegas hidden gems that most people don't know about. For breakfast you'll find all your favorites including an omelet station and a Spanish selection. I'm not a sweet eater but you sure get plenty of selections  so if you like cake for breakfast you can have that too. The casino has been renovated so if you want to play a modern slot  or $3 craps in a nice atmosphere  it's available. Overall great quality food at a very reasonable price.

The waiters and front desk associates are always helpful and you can't beat the 7.99 price if you join their rewards club. The food is decent nothing atrocious and nothing spectacular. The food is sometimes left out for too long but I'm sure that has to do with it being a slower buffet and also being lower budget.

The best part was the ham.  Everything else lacked flavor and made me feel not to well.  Never coming back to this place.', ""Tried out the the new Feast Buffet at Palace Station. Line went pretty quickly  but was very busy during lunch and some time after. \n\nWith the station card is was around 10 bucks for lunch. The new area is very much like Red Rock casino  but I'm guessing smaller. Service was excellent as we were seated at a table and quickly asked for drinks by a bubbly guy named Roy(I believe). I started out on a positive note  because they have strong brewed iced tea. Thank the lord. Machine iced tea taste likes it's filtered through a sock made out of artificial lemons and sugar. \n\nQuickly walked though the different stations. A wok area  healthy food  dessert  American fare  etc (see photos)\n\nThe make-a-salad section  which is the easiest to update  looked about the same as the old feast buffet at palace  ergo  sad. Don't get me wrong  it's fresh. But I wish they allowed for more options. They did up the surrounding area though. Most notably  rolls in little pull out drawers (which I assume helps freshness) and a hummus station  yes a station with hummus options (pictured). \n\nMoving on to the meat stations  we we chicken  ham  kielbasa (my fave) and pork belly (so the lady told us) to name a few items. The pork belly was good  but was thrown out like rib cuts  which  in my opinion  raises the fat to flavor ratio on the wrong side. I they would have played then and cut differently  you would have enjoyed the flavor more. The chicken was good  though a little dry  which was surprising since the turnover looked to be high during the rush. \nThe healthy station had tofu dishes  cauliflower replacements and other options that were hit and miss. \nThe make your taco station has half good with good meat options and a couple salsa options  but also half bad as the tortillas were flour discs that tasted like a flour tortilla and pita bread had a baby. Also  no guacamole  which I expect with flour tortillas. If you want the street taco vibe  stay with corn tortillas  easy and cheap fix. \nWok bar was good  made a small creation  guy doing the work was polite and quick. On the other side was a pasta station  though I skipped that option  so no real insight. (Hope it's as good as Palms pasta station). \nGelato and desert area was good  gelato was actually really flavorful  not sure of the brand. \nOver all  I would give this place a 3.5  but that's not an option  so I'll give a 4 Star. It's new and they have to fix the kinks still. Also  this area and food are miles ahead of the old PS buffet  that place was scary at the end  breakfast was a gamble and breakfast should always be easy anywhere you go. \nI am disappointed that they didn't take it to the same level as the Palms AYCE buffet. That is a great value and has fantastic choices. Yes the poke and elote there might scare some of the older people  but they can tell quality when they see it. \nOh  and they had a weird little drink station at the end with boba tea and horchata and other stuff.

The Top Round was a little dry and tough  but there were plenty of other meat choices. Some of the side dishes  such as the Hungarian Goulash were on the dry side from the heat lamps but still tasty. The salad bar had all the usuals plus a hummus and pita section with half a dozen flavor variations. The Healthy Section was novel and cooked 'bowls' to order for you. Another highlight was the matcha boba tea (without boba) and sugar rimmed horchata. The gelato was awesome and there was a nice selection of deserts in addition to cobblers and a soft-serve station. \n\nI'm giving Feast Buffet 5 Stars because of the great value for the money.

We still got the breakfast price of $6.99pp. We immediately got in the omlette line because we knee it closed at 11. After waiting about 20 minutes the breakfast turned to lunch and the omlette line became the carving station and burger line. I decided to get a burger instead and the guy decided to give everyone in line behind me a burger first and then i had to wait another 10 minutes for him to make more. It was horrible! Had no seasoning or flavor. I continued walking around the buffet to discover they only had salad lettuce to put on the burgers.

They were from a carton so they always seem to have that strange texture. Could also use some seasoning. I could have asked the omelet bar to make me a couple of eggs  but I didn't. The bacon was just ok. Stuck together (baked) so I ended up with more than I really wanted. Sausages were good. Biscuits and gravy were average. Shredded hash browns were average too.

This was at a time when I didn\'t go to LV buffets a lot so  I had nothing to compare this too. Now my opinion has changed since the last few times I\'ve been to ""Station Buffets"". Over crowded with people and food is not prepared right. I\'m passing on the ""station buffets"" because it doesn\'t matter which casino you go to  they all serve the same crappy food in which  is disappointing because imagine going to GVR and seeing the same slop as Palace Station.

My fiance and I also play MyVegas for complimentary rewards and discounts so we also had a voucher for a BOGO deal. Upon signing up for their Stations Boarding Pass we were also told that as new members we would get the chance to ""Crack The Vault"" and win a random amount of points (every 1000 points = $1). It\'s also pretty neat that you can use those points not only for games  but you can use it towards your meal as well. Score! The buffet at Palace Station is located upstairs. On a Sunday afternoon  there was about a 25-30 minute wait. With the BOGO discount and points we won from the promotion we only paid $5.25 or so for two people (brunch). There was not a huge variety  there was some good food but most of the entrees were bland. The prime rib looked good and juicy but was actually pretty dry. Do not even attempt to eat the chicken fried steak or french toast. I was disappointed in the dessert station and didn\'t try anything as nothing appealed to me. My fiance was not fond of the chicken noodle soup  he much prefers the soup at the Mirage the day prior. I liked that they had mini beef tamales  not bad at all in my opinion. The omelet station was good as well  the first time I walked by there was a small line of approximately 3-4 people. I decided to give it a try and there was only one person before me. Cook was nice and the omelet was delicious. I was actually sad I didn\'t eat the omelet first and could not enjoy it as much so late in the meal. They have a section for the dry cereal  but I think it would be more accommodating to the customer if there was milk available near by so that you would not need to get a hold of your server. Our dishes were removed about 3 times during our meal  not bad. Our server was nice and helpful. I was a little down that we hadn\'t tried the buffet at Red Rock hotel (sister hotel) instead  but for the price of $5.25 it was still a great steal!', ""The varied ratings for this buffet will tell a story not easily understood by people who haven't been to Palace Station's buffet more than once or twice.\n\nYour dining experience will vary GREATLY  depending on the time of day and your fellow diners.\n\nIf it is crowded  things get messy  food isn't filled quickly enough  stuff gets missed and it turns into a barely passable heap of mediocrity.

Love the fact that right by the booths there are big round tables to accommodate families of 6-8 people. My server was quick to get me some hot sauce and refills in a timely manner. The pasta station fills your plate up so be prepared if trying to get some shrimp.', ""Compared to the Sunset Station's buffet across town  this sister property should be embarrassed.  The line moved VERY slowly and once inside the food was a big step down from the other buffets in town.   Will avoid in the future."", ""This place is not bad for the price of a buffet. Ended up eating here three times too because of how cheap it is. The food is not bad as well. I love the meat station and how you can also make your own pasta. \n\nTheir desert was the best. Cheesecake is by far the best out of all the buffets I've been to. Their ice cream machine is really good as well and tasty. \n\nWill come here again. \n\nBasically you can get their advertised price\nFor the buffet if you have the hotels rewards. Otherwise they will charge you $4-8 extra on top of their advertised price. It's all good though the rewards card is free so make sure to get it before going here."", 'That has got to be the worst food ever from a feast buffet. Just steer away from the Chinese food  all the other food seem fine.', ""We ate here for the breakfast buffet on 4/25/2016  We paid about $20 for my wife and I.  We didn't have a casino rewards card or else it would've been $1-2 off each person.  The filipino cashier (I know he's filipino cuz I am filipino) asked if I wanted someone to come to us so they can make us a card.  I declined yet was amazed on his customer service when he offered this to us.  The hostess who sat us asked how we were doing.  I asked her how she was doing and she looked at me and laughed as if she was was having a bad day.  She could've lied.\nThe buffet had everything I expected and was surprised to see that they had menudo.  The only thing missing was the fixings' for this mexican soup.  That was a total bummer. Slabs of bacon  sausage and ham were the norm.  Pancakes  waffles  french toast and the omelette station were also avail.  Donuts  pastries...blah  blah  blah.  Everything else was great  especially since the price was right even without the rewards card. \nI would recommend eating here to everyone.  Though  we only ate here once during our week here because we wanted to try other places."", 'Being that I don\'t really live in the area  and it is the OLDEST of the ""Station Casinos"" (starting as Bingo Palace in 1976)  I make it a point to avoid Palace Station. It seems a bit run-down  old  and there is a ""funky"" odor about it. \n\nI\'ve eaten at the buffet several times prior to 2004  but stopped going when I had a bad experience  not to mention moving into another part of town. I usually stick close to where I live when it comes to eating.\n\nNow  I\'ve been to the Santa Fe Station\'s buffet  the one at Red Rock  Green Valley Ranch  Sunset Station  and even Texas Station. They\'re awesome. I do love GVR and Santa Fe buffets more. \n\nPalace Station? My visit on 9/19/2014 was a reminder of why I don\'t go there. \n\nBeing that I played ""myVegas"" Rewards on Facebook  I was delighted to see that they had ""comps"" and rewards to Red Rock  Palace Station  and another Station Casino.\n\nSince my mom works 4-hours on Fridays  I decided that the lunch would be a great idea since she works in the area. \n\nIt was the worst idea. Thankfully  it was free. That\'s the only good part of the meal and experience.\n\nFirst I had to stop at the Rewards Center to get my ""comp""  then it was upstairs to the buffet. There was no one in line  so my mom and I walked up to the counter. The cashier was quite nasty even before I brought out the comp slip. I had to show my Driver License and Boarding Pass. \n\nThe cashier rung up the meal  and handed my ""loyalty"" card to my mother and dismissed me entirely; despite the fact it was MY ""comp"" that paid for the meal. The cashier didn\'t even look at me as she handed the card and receipt to my mother. \n\nAt age 38  I think I\'ve passed the ""oh  you look so young stage"" that the cashier felt she needed to hand my card to my mother. Sorry  but I found that insulting. One has to be 21 to get a ""Boarding Pass""  and mine has my ""member since date"" on it. It was issued in 1997  over 17 years ago. \n\nGetting over that incident  my mother handed my Boarding Pass back to me so I could put it in MY wallet. That didn\'t start off the experience that well. But  I let it go. Maybe for some reason  the cashier was having a bad day. \n\nThen we waited  and waited ... for about 15 minutes to be seated. The reason? NONE. There were PLENTY of tables. In the one section we were seated in  there were only eight other patrons. That area could easily seat 150  or more. Yet  we had to wait. \n\nSorry  but if you have the seating available ... you should seat your patrons asap. But  that\'s my take on it. \n\nAll unoccupied tables were clean and ready for people to sit at  so it wasn\'t as if they\'d been busy and were cleaning up. \n\nWe were able to order the drinks quite quickly  but once we got our food? We weren\'t asked if we wanted refills on our drinks until we were bone dry  and ready to leave. We were cleaning up our area  and grabbing our purses when we were asked if we wanted refills. \n\nNo thanks  we\'re leaving.\n\nThe staff didn\'t bother to check on us  only took the dirty plates and walked away -- place wasn\'t that busy either. Again  only eight people in our section  and there were 3-4 servers working the area. Maybe they\'re having a bad day. So  I figured we\'d ease their load and leave.\n\nAs far as the food ... \n\nThe food was terrible. Honestly  it SUCKED! \n\nIn addition to such a small selection  the meats  including the turkey were OVERCOOKED  TOUGH  and DRY. The supposedly ""hot"" pasta was COLD  most of the cold foods were on the warm side  the warm foods? Stone cold. The only good thing? The desserts.They were the ONLY edible part of the meal. \n\nAgain  since it was free  I can\'t complain too much. But  I wouldn\'t pay for it whether or not it is a ""great value"". Isn\'t a great value if you can\'t eat much of the selection and the service is not up to par. \n\nMaybe they were having a terrible day  maybe they were off. But  I don\'t think I will visit again. I can\'t justify rating a place simply on price. I have been to better  and I\'ve been to the worst. The worst was the old (now gone) Boardwalk Holiday Inn Buffet on the strip. This one? I\'ll pass. It\'s not going to be the end of my world.', 'Beastly.  When the only edible morsels at the buffet are the cornbread  egg drop soup and the mussels (I know...who would risk shellfish when everything else was so awful) something is very very wrong.  The BBQ pork was so tough if fired from a slingshot it could have downed a mastodon.  Not since high school was a dissection so difficult as the one I performed on the sweet and sour chicken  looking for chicken.  It was missing.  The rare roast beef appeared to be painted pink.  And the hot dogs?  Ha ha ha.  Gray  floating in putrid water.  Salad was wilted and brown.  Never to return.', 'Decent food at decent price. Staff is friendly and would recommend this place. If you have the Players Card you get a discount on the price. Would definitely come back here again.', ""Located in the Palace Station   this is the second time I've been here.  First time was after I had just gotten married and this time   3 kids later.  Nothing much has changed. Food is standard buffet fare.  Definitely on the lower quality side.  They have the salads  soups   pizza   fried chicken   burgers and dogs. They also do have the meat carving station. All in all  not impressive. There are many other places that serve better buffet food."", ""Another day  another buffet. Solid place for bulking on a budget. A lot of protein for ~$12. Overall your standard buffet. The carving station typically has roast beef or brisket. The Mediterranean salad is on point. Things are constantly rotated so you don't have to worry about items sitting out for long period of time. Dessert bar is lacking but what do you expect for the price. Service is great. Will be back on bulking days."", 'Food salty cold and takes long time for adding to empty trays and just most side dishes gets transferred from cans ... into the display plate dishes...refill drinks only if you asked for... \nused to be a nice local place and Will not try to come back', ""Wow where do I begin almost speechless on this one!!! \n\nSo I use to work concierge for Palace Station and had got to work early so I decided to breakfast at their buffet. \n\nWhat a MISTAKE! \n\nBIG TIME YUCKO!!! \n\nSo I went for breakfast at like 7am so food should be fresh and delicious I'm thinking it should be. I tried their nasty watery runny eggs omg I almost threw up! \n\nI also tried their extra crispy burned bacon I think it cut my throat going down! So last and just as least as the other items I tried their oatmeal because I figured how can you mess up oatmeal well Palace Station was successful at messing that up to! \n\nI think I would of had a better dining experience eating out of their dumpster! Yes it was extremely cheap in price but come on I don't expect to go to a Station Casino and eat dog food! \n\nPlease I beg of you NEVER EAT HERE! \n\nNote: Service is awful the server made me feel like I was inconveniencing her when I asked for a refill on coffee then rolled her eyes when I ordered a chocolate milk! WOW Sorry to have disturbed you DOING YOUR JOB!!!"", ""Went here for a late lunch. It's your standard typical buffet but better than most buffets in old downtown. Hubby and I got to eat free cause he had comps for 2 adults. I have been here for breakfast before and it was good. However  the lunch buffet was okay. Not too much to chose from. I enjoyed the dessert section. I enjoyed the cheese burger here. I forgot to take a photo of that but it was delicious! I had an iced tea to drink. The waitress didn't even bother to refill my drink. I enjoyed eating the vegetable noodles and the eggplant Parmesan. Very tasty and seasoned perfectly. The pork was tender. Tasted like Tocino. It was a little on the tough side and didn't enjoy chewing on it  so I spit it out on a napkin. Uggggh! \nI also got to try the deep fried catfish. Yes  I said catfish. It was delicious! It was crunchy on the outside and tender and moist on the inside. \nFor dessert  I had the pumpkin pie which was great since I love the flavors in a pumpkin pie. Perfect spice and sweetness to it. I also sampled a canolli  a small blueberry muffin and a cookie (not pictured). \nThe desserts were good. \nService was okay. There were a few waitresses working the floor that were busy. The waitress that took our drink order forgot to refill my iced tea. Other than that  my experience was okay. This place is a must for breakfast!"", ""For 8.99 with a players card you can't beat that. The food is a pretty good selection  but the cashier is always terrible! The older lady who's normally there for dinner time is a bitch. Who charges full price for a 2 year old?? My daughter doesn't even eat a full plate. & she's just rude all the time."", 'Just left the buffet  this may be the only casino that charges children aged 3  almost full price for a buffet. The renovations are great but this was unexpected  especially for a local', 'I ate here out of desperation and I wasn\'t expecting much but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. This is not a bad buffet despite appearances. Now  it\'s not as ""fancy"" as Red Rock or Green Valley Ranch  but it\'s cheap and a remarkably good value. I\'m also happy to report that my purchase of this buffet did not come with a free ride on the diarrhea express (I\'m looking at you  Sunset Station). \n\nThe food is simple and not fussy. The buffet is tiny but there\'s a good salad bar  pizza  Chinese food that\'s comparable to Panda Express  some okay Mexican options (but really tasty chicken fajitas -- go figure)  and the usual suspects like mac and cheese  mashed potatoes  fried shrimp and a made-to-order pasta station. There aren\'t a lot of green vegetables on offer here so veggie lovers like me will want to load up on salad. I was shocked at the quality and variety of meats at their carving station. During our visit they had really good roast beef  turkey  ham and fresh salmon! I know they switch up the selections but I felt like I hit the buffet jackpot. The desserts are good too  and there are several sugar free options. \n\nIf you have a Stations Casinos dining coupon / offer  this is a great place to spend it. You get the most bang for your buck here since the buffet is so inexpensive. The two of us had a $30 free comp and we got two dinner buffets and a bottle of wine and still had comp money left over. Now calm down  their wine selections are about what you\'d expect. We slummed it with a bottle of Beringer white zinfandel and it brought back nostalgic memories of my college days. Even if you don\'t plan to gamble one penny in the casino  sign up for the free Stations players card and they\'ll knock a couple of bucks off the price of your buffet if you show it when you pay. \n\nThis is not the best buffet in town  not by a long shot  but the food is tasty  cheap and you can feed your entire family a much heartier meal for just a few bucks more than at In-N-Out burger across the street.', ""Revamped  Renewed and Redone! Palace Station has outdone themselves on this one. This is the latest and greatest from Stations. I only have one small complaint. There is no lox at the Champagne Brunch. Other than that  I say enjoy this place before the introductory prices go away. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"", ""So My Boyfriend and I tried this out this weekend  I must say it was quite good... Its a really big buffet  but not a good variety I would say  or a least not the best variety! The food tht was there was absolutely delicious though  we went for Prime Rib and Shrimp night... tht was the special and you could get as much as you would like and that goes for whatever the special is for tht day or night. I would still definitely go back it was really good Prime Rib  and you can get it cooked to the temp. of your liking. All the other food was super fresh  taste just right didnt need any extra seasoning  warm  kept it coming out... it was definitely a good try. Their dessert section is crazy amazing  there are so many fresh dessert like constantly put out! OMG they had tttthhhheeeeeeeee BEST BREAD PUDDING i eat bread pudding anywhere I cant get a good one and I had to go back for 2nd's on this one! This was overall a great experience and I would definitely recommend it or take friends and family here!"", ""We came for dinner and the line didn't look that long. But it moved incredibly slowly.

I will not be coming back."", ""So as a member of the frequent Players Club I received a coupon in the mail  for a two for one buffet. It cost us $9.72 for two for dinner and we pigged out on amazing food. Granted it was not super duper but the food was pretty good and of course it was a buffet so there were plenty of options. Certainly well worth $9.72 .

I find the food lacking. Desserts are ok', ""The buffet is one of the cheapest you are going to find here  but it's one of the worst buffets in Las Vegas. I don't know how people even give this place a 5 star rating  and I'm thinking some of these reviews are fake. They have the most basic food you can find - hard shell tacos  hamburger  spaghetti  pizza  cheap ham  and water down ice cream."", ""Really...I only came to this buffet because:\n\n1) It's close to my work\n2) I had a comp for a free buffet that was due to expire by the weekend\n\nI'm really not too picky about buffets in general because:\n\n1) I'm a cheap eater...lots makes me happy\n2) I eat at Chinese buffets!  An iron stomach comes in handy\n\nBut the Feast Buffet in Palace Station?  Meh.  MEH!  I really have had better.  The only saving grace for this place is the near extreme cheap prices for breakfast  lunch  and dinner.  If you go for dinner it's less than $9 before tax!  If your budget is in a recession and you want choices (or you're a UNLV undergrad on a date and want to impress with quantity) than come visit here.  If you're looking for quality...ah  you might want to saunter somewhere else.\n\nI had eaten at the Feast Buffet several years back and I just don't remember it.  It wasn't good  but I don't remember it being bad.  It's just very lackluster.  I'm sure when O.J. Simpson stayed here pre-arrest he probably ate here.  If I came that day  I probably would have given this place another star.  Yeah  some food  and possibly a signed football from one of the greats?  Sure.  Of course this all depends if I had a football on me that day.\n\nThis Feast Buffet is typical as those of all the other Station Casinos in town  with one major caveat - SIZE.  Yes  unfortunately in this case size does matter.  This buffet is like only 1/3 the size of the rest of them!  I've seen more choices (and fresher choices) at the local Golden Corral!  It's just sad.  So sad.  It's like Palace Station is the bastard child of Station Casinos.  Nothing about this place screams gourmet.  No sushi (even faux sushi)  no real Asian section either.  Pot stickers (badly cooked ones)  and fried egg rolls DO NOT make up an Asian section.  The Feast Buffet at Palace Station is heavy on American and Mexican fare.  \n\nThough to their credit they do include an Italian build-your-own pasta section  where the cook will make you any basic pasta dish you like with you choice of veggies  meats  and sauces (LOL...red  or white..seriously).  That is not bad as long as the chef cooks your pasta right.  Luckily my Fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp was hard to mess up.  Only complaint was that the sauce was too heavy with not enough cheese.\n\nThe rest of this buffet was really kinda just under average.  The carving section with meats was OK  the only standout to me was the carnitas which were tender.  You can also have a cheeseburger done on the grill  just demand that you get a fresh patty thrown on and not one that sits on the side in a container of grease.  Yuck. \n\nThe salad bar was way under par  not only was it messy at the time  but a lot of the veggies didn't look freshly prepared.  Lots of canned stuff.  Color me not impressed.\n\nDon't even get me started on the dessert section.  What a shame!  It's like a tiny island in the middle of nowhere.  And the desserts STINK.  Basic cakes and pies  that really don't look all that appetizing.  What...no gelato?  Only soft serve available and it was no bueno.  \n\nThe Feast Buffet here (as well as possibly the majority of Palace Station) needs some serious renovating.  I would gladly pay a dollar more for the buffet if it was vastly improved.  It needs some serious help.  Until then I probably won't be back.  Unless I get another comp that needs to be used on a Monday - Thursday."", ""They're have many foods here. About the test is ok. And dessert not good. But about the price not expensive."", 'Went today for lunch had a good selection of food that tasted fresh & hot.\nDesserts were abundant and tasty the chocolate cake  was fresh and tasty.', ""Ok at best. $10 if you have a player's card. Normally $17.\n\nPros: the desserts. Soft serve and pastries  nothing too special though...\n\nCons: no vegetarian options at all. Careful on the rice and vegetables as they use chicken base.\n\nMy friend who eats meat wasn't able to finish a single item stating they were overlooked and tasteless.\n\nOverall  there are much better food options elsewhere in the hotel. When I asked the manager about their vegetarian options  their annoyed response made it clear that customer service is not that important to them."", ""Not the best buffet in town  but with the price seems justifiable. Breakfast crew is much better than dinner. Evening servers are rude. Can't complain too much about the food too much though."", 'Do not eat here! We should\'ve known when we asked the cashier if the food was good and she replied ""Well.....it\'s the best priced buffet in Vegas."" Everything was horrible !', 'Because we stayed in the hotel  it is very convenient to eat there. The food is delicious  service staff is good  too!\nThe most important is the price is very competitive in Vegas area!', 'The first time I went to the Palace Buffet is was delicious  service was great  food was delicious and I really enjoyed it  couldn\'t wait to go back.  Everything was so new and pretty looking and tasted great.  Chefs were walking around making sure everything looked and tasted good.  THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME WHEN IT JUST HAD OPENED.\nNow the reason for the ONE STAR this time was because the food isn\'t the same  as usual it is what it is.  Roast Beef was so rare you thought the cow was still attached to the slice.  Chinese food was OK  however the Beef in the Mongolian beef was unchewable.  Sushi was OK  not great just OK  the turkey was again OK but just OK  nothing special.  It didn\'t have that look or taste like when it first opened.  Deserts were nothing special either.  Mostly different color cheesecake  what seems to be the most popular is the gelato (which I don\'t eat)..... \nSo it was disappointing  and I was even more disappointed because I had to excuse myself from my table and head to the restroom because the Buffet did not agree with me at all.  I returned to the table with my stomach hurting and mentioned it to the manager and she said ""Sorry you didn\'t like the Buffet""????????  how is that going to improve it????So with all the Station Buffets to choose from I will go elsewhere.  I will take QUALITY OVER QUANTITY any day.  Had a miserable tummy ache all night and didn\'t enjoy myself at all.  Good-bye Palace Station  food is terrible.', ""Of all the feasts I've been to  this one is dead last on service and selection. It is also the smallest buffet I've ever been to in Las Vegas. They have a place in the middle where you can order either a fresh from the grill burger or made-to-order pasta. It seems like it would be a good idea  however the set up lacks a place to actually put in an order  being that there is glass up and all around. If you are of average height you either have to bend down or tip toe over the glass to be heard. Even then the cooks let me stand over there for a good portion of time before they would even acknowledge I was waiting to place an order. One even caught my eye and flat out ignored me. The buffet is small  poorly stocked and a flat out waste of time and money. Just go elsewhere."", ""This is one of my Favorites! Went for lunch this time. I had some roast Turkey slices and some Ham also..mashed potatoes and gravy.

They were so delicious  I sorta have a soft spot for Chinese and American comfort items! I tried this amazing shrimp dish with spinich and mushrooms in a very light sauce  it was amazing. The wait staff is very very nice and catering to its customers. It's always nice to eat here. The atmosphere is comforting  relaxed and super enjoyable.

Especially being the original I thought for sure it should be the best  but instead the worse. If you remember the buffet in Vegas Vacation  this was the scene. Fortunately there were name cards above the food so you knew what it was suppose to be. The only thing that looked appetizing was the roast beef. Which I ate  along with some steak fries. Even when they brought out fresh items to replace  they were just plopped on top of the older food. The dessert station was ok. I thought it was smart to do small desserts. However it was kind of a turn off at the server throwing them around on the sheet tray  and if one fell (which there were two) on the floor  it was an ""oh well"" attitude. \nThe atmosphere is ok  nothing special. The booths are also very tight. About a foot and a half of room between the benches. Not the best if you have long legs. Our waitress was a jewel. So sweet and attentive.

Everything we tried was barely warm and not the best. My coffee wasn't even warm. The waitress did bring another cup that was but I don't think that should have ever been an issue. The hash browns were gray...my brave husband tried them but he said they were cold and blah. The best thing I ate was a piece of bacon & a semi warm tamale (another less breakfast more lunch choice). Needless to say we won't be back even if it was free. I would rather pay more & have a decent hot breakfast that I can enjoy."", 'Worst Buffet out of all stations this place had little items to choose from the cooked food to order very bland and the employees lack customer service \nI Will not come back to this location and I advise you to not even waste your money or time with this buffet', ""OK  so the only reason I gave this place 5 stars is because of the value for the  price!\nI don't know how they do it for such a low price (the highest one is obviously dinner  and it's like under $10 with a players card  and if you don't have one  they have someone on standby who will issue one in like 3 mins AND you don't lose your place in line)\nFood is about 4.5 stars  and really is great  don't get me wrong.\nDuring breakfast  you will find plain pancakes  cookies and cream pancakes  AND chocolate chip pancakes!\nMy son and I go to Vegas about 4 times a year  and we have tried other buffets.

Here's my 2 cents on my mealtimes  in chronological order-\n\nLunch - A step-down from your local Hometown Buffet.  There is a grill where diners can ask for slices of roast beef/turkey  burgers  hot dogs & brats.  Located next to it  is a pasta station where pasta is made to order with whatever choice ingredients the diner desires.  The rest of the hot/cold foods were decent  but nothing extraordinary.  The dessert section was nice w/ various cakes  cookies  sweets and the obligatory nonfat froyo machines.  Overall  meh.\n\nDinner - See lunch  but w/ a few extra items scattered hither & thither.  Not worth the extra cost  IMHO.\n\nBreakfast -  Now we're talking!  Several egg dishes  mounds of bacon  biscuits & gravy  country fried steak etc.  There is also an omelette station where diners can have an omelette their way.  The dessert section had most of the same items from lunch/dinner  plus various doughnuts and other items.  \n\nThe Feast Buffet is an affordable  no-frills buffet.  I recommend breakfast over lunch & dinner for those interested in checking this buffet out.  I had free buffet vouchers  but if I had to pay  I would stick to breakfast.\n\nExcelsior!"", ""We went to the Palace Station's Feast Buffet during their Wednesday 50 plus 1/2 point dining promotion.  We earned some extra points during January's Point Giveaway so we used our Boarding Pass and got two free dinner buffets. On most nights you would pay $8 each for the buffet and we've done that many times.  You can't really beat that price which includes a beverage.  They can't compare to a Strip Buffet but they aren't trying to  and people shouldn't expect the same quality and selection.  You aren't paying $30 per person or more either. There's plenty of choices on the buffet line and also the made-to-order pasta line that's super.  The Staff was friendly and quick to remove plates and refill drinks.

The decor reminds me of red rock or m resort. The chairs are comfortable. The food is much better than the palms buffet. Fried chicken was the highlight.

Although  that's what people think vegans are only able to eat  we actually have such a variety of food we consume  it is just not available at buffets very often.

This buffet was the worst I've been at in Vegas.  First of all  my taco shells were stale!  It tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for days!  I went to the egg station where I witnessed the egg cook make dozens of mistakes and discarded half a dozen eggs. After what felt like twenty minutes with three other people in front of me  I asked for poached eggs but the cook told me they didn't have an egg poacher and offered me steam eggs instead.  A few minutes later  I received two runny undercooked steamed eggs.  I should have known this cook didn't know how to cook eggs since he kept asking the customers if the eggs looked cooked enough before he took them off the stove. \n\nMost of the food were borderline edible and just plain bad.  The only things I liked here were their desserts (lemon meringue  cheese danish  etc.).  It's just a shame that the people who run this buffet doesn't care or know what good food is.

We like Station Casino buffets ( especially Green Valley Ranch and Red Rock  but also Sunset Station ) so when we saw the tv commercial for the new Feast Buffet we decided to give it a chance. We were not disappointed! The surroundings are now pretty and the food is delicious.  Great selection  too. Even special little side dishes that you normally just find on the Strip  like polenta  boba drinks mushroom quesadillas  naan bread  and a wide selection of hummus. Special deserts like caramel pop corn  ice cream sandwiches and Creme brûlée. Also a wide selection of sugar free deserts for diabetics. We wished we had 7 stomachs like the alien Alf from the old tv show. Lol.  I would give 5 stars  but there were a few little things  hardly worth criticizing. They ran out of boba balls for the cute little boba drinks  they ran out of soy sauce and our server cleaned our booth as if we had left when we went to get desert. We returned with the desert and the table and seats were soaking wet  our drinks were gone  and the table was set anew. We had to use the new napkins to dry the seats and table in order to be able to eat desert. The server was very apologetic and brought us new drinks. All in all a very good experience and we will definitely return! Palace Station is not a dump anymore! We hope Sunset Station will follow suit and make their buffet equally good. It is now the weakest of the Station casino buffets."", ""Worst buffet that I have been to in Vegas. Food sits and gets cold  is dry  and just tastes bad.

Fiesta Rancho runs closely behind in this category.

Unfortunately most of our comps are at Palace which I enjoy very much and like most of the restaurants such as the Oyster Bar (great 2am late night). Also The Broiler has great food  although the environment is no comparison to any of the steakhouses at the other stations.', 'We got coupons in the mail for the buffet so we decided to try it. It\'s up the escalators. There was a very long line- could they have gotten the same promotion? The selection was decent. It could fool you  since both sides are the same stuff  just at different ends. The food was not good. The desserts was probably better than the food itself. \n\nWe ended up going twice to see if maybe we came on a \'off\' day (but regretted it). I agree with pgmj  that it\'s along with ""Circus Circus terrible."" The service was good. The atmosphere isn\'t that good- kind of dreary and depressing- a little dark.

I have always had a great food and service experience at the Feast Dinner but I have to say that the Feast Overnight buffet was very mediocre. For those of us that remember the Palace Late Night Feast in the old days; there is no comparison. The current food choices are very limited and not that appetizing for a buffet. Also  our bill was rung up incorrectly twice by the cashier as a result of using our 2 for 1 slot club coupon. I will probably not return to the Feast Overnight Buffet until the food is improved.', 'This place was very friendy and food was great variety price could be a little better but i was happy over all.', ""Horrible lunch buffet.

It was convenient  off Strip  and we usually got very good service. I like the new restaurant  it\'s absolutely gigantic and offers pretty much the same stuff that it did before. The problem is they jacked the price up so high that they have priced us locals completely out.\n\nWe will not be able to return for $18 a plate. It is a good option for people who are staying in Las Vegas and need a place with free parking. But  now the buffet costs about the same as the higher-end buffets that would offer things like crab legs and table service. This one does not. \n\nThis feels like just another ""screw you locals"" from Las Vegas in whole. I really hoped Stations would not join in  as they have always catered to locals  but it looks like they\'re going in that direction. I hope they continue with free parking. We\'ll see.\n\nSo to recap  this went from our go-to affordable family-friendly buffet to so expensive that we will no longer be able to come unless it\'s a super special occasion.

As hubby walked up to order a burger he said they had the patties in a pan of water on the grill (I guess cooking them) and then they placed the burger on the grill for 30 seconds then handed it to him. Needless to say the burger was raw. \n\nOther lunch items were inedible and we were highly disappointed.

It's a cross between Red Rock's Feast and Green Valley Ranch's Feast.  Liking the new decor with the modern aesthetic and the sturdy tables & chairs!  The buffet line is also nice & spread out to allow walking room.  As seems typical now of many buffets  the salad bar is located right in the middle of the dining room.\n\nHonestly  the food is much better than the previous iteration of Palace Station's Feast Buffet - but I hate saying it  the quality control is still a bit of an issue.  There were many things that were cooked well  but other items were off.  The meats were touch & go  for dinner the beef at the carving station looked overdone (I myself prefer pink in the middle)  as well as the pork BBQ ribs over at the smoking station.  Some of the various pizzas were probably sitting too long under the lamps so the crusts were on the dry side.  However  some of this can be expected at a buffet that feeds thousands in a day.  Some items just won't be as popular as other items on the line and they will just sit there.\n\nThe one thing I wanna warn folks about at the Feast Buffet - be wary of the 'boba' drinks!  They are just wayyyyy too sweet & artificial!  It is a nice effort on their part to add some variety to the buffet  but these boba drinks are just not very good & not worth your calories!\n\nI did enjoy a lot of their items though:\n\n-Smoked kielbasa & hot link\n-Cheeseburger slider\n-Smoked beef brisket & pork ribs\n-Various sushi\n-Salt & pepper wings\n-Sesame Cauliflower (surprise fave!)\n-Mini meatloaf\n-Taco flatbread & cheeseburger flatbread (actually really tasty!)\n\nThe Feast Buffet dessert station is fairy typical of their other ones  but they do have the addition of ice cream sandwiches!  I saw folks get them made with either cookies or a donut cut in half.  Sweet treat!\n\nI like the Feast Buffet at Palace Station enough that I'd come back frequently for a value lunch because it's so close to my work.  I mean  it would only cost about $9!  If you got one of those coupons that give you a 50% discount  lunch would only cost me $4.50!  As a matter of fact  I DO have one in my wallet right now!

It was lunch time and the price with the boarding pass was like $6.00.  This buffet is tiny so if you\'re used to the other Feast buffets at Station Casinos  you\'ll be immediately disappointed.   While the selections were limited  the food they did have was decent and hot and for 6 bucks thats all I can ask for...........well and a soft serve ice cream machine  which they also had.  Highlights were probably the mac & cheese (I love terrible buffet style mac & cheese)  fried chicken (surprisingly tender) and roast beef from the carving station (I know  a carving station at a 6 dollar buffet  gotta love Vegas).  \n\nOverall  a solid option if your at the Palace Station retracing OJ\'s steps to see where he attempted to ""get his sh*t back.""  Nothing to drive out of your way for but if the wallets tight and you need a lot of chow  its hard to beat this place.  \n\nPS- The shame returned on the escalator ride down.  People seem to be staring at you like ""really?  Did you just do that?"" .....just don\'t make eye contact and it\'ll be ok.', ""I love this idea of a midnight buffet. Didn't quite know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised. They only have about half the buffet lines with available food options. There's an omelette/egg station  some fried options  mash potatoes etc. the full salad bar is open and so are the desserts. Service was great and the staff were all very friendly. And for $6.99 with a players card  best deal in town for sure. I'll definitely be back. For you night owls out there  if your hungry late at night you gotta come give this place a try."", ""The manager offered us a free meal because it was our first time. Tip: get the free play card for a discount or talk to one of the workers and they'll gladly give a free meal!"", ""$7.99 weekend brunch /w players card.  I believe the normal price is 9.99  but anyways for $10 you shouldn't expect much in vegas these days but this buffet does deliver decent food.  The usual items: bacon  sausage  eggs  pancakes  etc were there and of decent quality.  The brunch items included fried chicken  some kind of Chinese beef and onions  and I don't remember - I didn't eat too much.  But I did like their selection of fruit (watermelon  cantolope  apples  oranges) and some of their desserts weren't that bad.  The drinks are self-serve.  Bottom line is the place is clean and decent enough and if you're staying or gambling at Palace Station this place should suit your needs."", 'We had been wanting to check out the remodeled and renovated Palace Station and finally stopped in 11/7. We were here a year ago and saw no reason to return.The casino was dark and dingy and worn and the buffet was below average.  Now  the whole casino looks updated  brighter and cleaner. \nAfter reading the posted poor reviews on the buffet  we had very low expectations  but went for dinner anyway. Love the décor. Looks a lot like Red Rock. Every employee we interacted with from the cashier to the hostess  server and behind the buffet workers were great. They were all cheerful  smiling and helpful. Our server  Will  was the greatest! One of the best servers at any buffet in town that we have had. \nThe food selection and quality was very good. I would rate it better than Green Valley  which we frequent often since it is closer to home. \nCarving station selections of turkey  chicken  roast beef  brisket  sausage....more than you would expect. The brisket and roast beef were as good or better than any I have had on a buffet. \nThere were 4 in our party and no one had anything they were disappointed with.\nDessert section is the only area I would rate as average or underwhelming.', 'There\'s a McDonalds across the street.  If you\'re looking for a bargain  might I suggest you get some fresh air and walk across the street?\n\nThis place unfortunately reminds me of the old Terrible\'s buffet  now Silver Sevens. Coming up the escalator I had flashbacks.  Sadly  I did not go with my gut at the top of the escalator and make a u-turn.  The good news  it\'s better than Terrible\'s  even cheaper.  The bad news  read my opening sentence.\n\nJust don\'t do it.  Even if you go in with low expectations  even if the price beckons to you and you\'re rationalizing  what do I have to lose?\n\nSalad dressings not labeled  roast beef could not have been more tasteless and unappealing (well  it DID look good under the heat lamp  I dunno what happened between the time the guy cut it  and it got back to my table!)  limited selections  food just didn\'t ""look"" appealing.\n\nPlease  show some backbone  put down your player\'s card  stop thinking of the price  just walk outside and head across the street.', ""Definite upgrade at Palace Station.  I've only eaten the Midnight buffet and it had a reduced selection but nice with omelette stations  fish  chicken  pork  and veggie choices for about $7 bucks with player card.  Tough to beat that."", ""wow.horribad buffet.got a 2 for 1 coupon  ate more than i should  and i still feel like i overpaid.the food itself was not completely hopeless  but the selection and size of the place was.the wait staff seems completely bored and walk by to check up on you so much that its annoying.i know you want a tip  but cool it a little.i wasn't expecting filet mignon here  but a wider variety of food would be nice. it is a buffet after all.if they got rid of the ridiculously large desert station  they might have enough room to fit some more actual food."", ""I remember coming to Feast Buffet when their original location was on the second floor. At that time  the wait was approximately an hour or so. Today the newly renovated buffet is located on the main floor near the slots and gaming area. It has been expanded to include more food station and a lot more seat accommodation. The buffet dinner price of $12.99 is applicable if you have a Boarding Pass Gold+ and it's $14.99 if you have a Boarding Pass Preferred. Without a pass card  the Regular price is $17.99. \n\nI notice the new layout looks modern and the furnishing decor is way more appealing. They offer a few selection of Asian food including sushi  noodles  soup  and stir fry. In the middle  they have a cold salad bar station and fresh fruits. They have American food like mac n cheese  fries  mashed potatoes  bbq  and carved meats. And there's Italian food like pizza and pasta. On the far right is the dessert station  which has an assortment of mini cakes and rolls  pastry  fudge brownie  cookies and ice cream. \n\nI think the new location is great. It's convenient and better accessibility. The expansive design allows diners to have more room to walk instead of feeling cramp and that is a plus star for improvement. In addition  I feel the service is nice too. Our server Dennis came to our table with the most friendliest smile  he is attentive  and he kept our drinks filled. Regarding on how food taste  I would say it's decent but you get a little more options for All You Can Eat at a reasonable price.""]"

She got the bartender to get me a drink that wasn't  on the menu  and even brought me out a cake!! She offered to sing  warned me of her mad skills  but I declined! We chatted instead.\n\nSecond time  I brought my god mother here. She loved it too. \n\nThis woman  is a 72 year old spit fire with a potty mouth who hates just about everything!! She adores this place now! Except the parking lol she told me to put in a request for a rail car for elderly people.\n\nBoth times I was adventurous  and ordered the special of the day.

My husband and I brought our son  my parents  and sister here  and the general reaction was that this restaurant has a lot of promise  but it's not living up to that potential...yet. This is an aspirational review. We were really excited about the prospect of a craft brew and burger place being in Gastonia  but one of the keys to what makes craft food attractive is the quality of the ingredients  and it is clear that the food here is very conventional  which to me lacks flavor and is not worth the extra cost. The types of burgers were interesting  but the food came to us very greasy  and it lacked the flavor that comes with local or especially fresh ingredients. We did enjoy the beer  nice selection. Our server was also very nice. We were very uncomfortable when we sat down because the sun was directly in our faces - no blinds to block the sun. We moved to a table that had less direct sun  but it was dirty from a previous party I assume. As a mom of a young child  I was horrified by the floor throughout the place  which was covered in grease  spilled drinks  and bits of food. My husband said that his feet slowly slipped apart as he stood to see the beer selection at the bar  just because of the amount of grease on the floor. I did not hide my disgust in my facial expression at the floor  which a server saw  but instead of getting someone to clean up the floor  she shuffled off to the back with an offended look on her face and then went on about her work. No one cleaned the floor while we were there. I'd be willing to go back (my husband less so)  but I would hope for fresher ingredients  a better seating area  and a cleaner floor."", 'Waited about 40 min for a Chicago Dog... when I finally got it....I it was a wiener on a bun with sliced onions and dill pickle chips.....nuff said.. save your money and go to sonic.', ""So we waited 45 minutes and the waitress never even came by to refill our drinks. Never brought our appetizers and was generally rude. The manager was no better when we asked about when our food would arrive. He blamed it on supply problems? If you don't have something tell the customers not just let them wait. We will never be back. Giving 1 star because I can't give it zero."", ""I think Howlers could be good  but it fell very short. The best part of our meal was the wings. We ordered Caribbean jerk  and although I am not sure that is a good description of the taste  the seasoning was delicious. For a burger and beer place  we were surprised they did not ask us how we wanted our burgers cooked. Then they came out very well done  way overcooked. They have a nice craft beer selection  but they don't have printed menus of the beers they are currently offering and our waitress couldn't tell us  so we had to physically get up and go look at the board near the bar.

That being said  this is an honest review so others don't waste their hard earned money. Tried this place for the first time and we won't be back. Bland food that is overly priced; Five Guys Burgers is MUCH better and you don't have to wait 30 minutes for it. We started with the pickle fries; they were crispy but the batter didn't have a sprinkle of seasoning in it. I ordered the Steak Burger and my husband order the Granny Smith burger. Both were cooked beyond well done and once again  didn't have seasoning. The lack of flavor was confusing bc there were toppings! The wait staff needs more training; when you have to ask twice for the bill and the waitress still goes off to sweep and walk around the restaurant there's a lack of customer service training there. Really disappointed bc I wanted to like this place."", ""We love wings and beer and were excited when Howlers opened. We stopped in on a Sunday for lunch around 1230 on our way to the dog park.

The wings were pretty good  beer is a no brainer  then the chicken sandwich arrived. It was a burger  which would have been ok if the bartender had not insisted she put it in correct then pulled all the kitchen tickets to prove it. Turns out she had put it in wrong. By now it was after 130 and we did not have time to wait for them to remake it. We can't say much about the food at this time. If we go back I will do a new review.

She didn\'t hesitate to say ""well we can\'t do that OR let me ask the chef if we can do that for you"". It was great  made me happy. So we ordered the big family plate for 2 and we waited. \n\nWhen the food came out to our table  my eyes grew big. It was a huge plate of about 4 huge rolls and some had bacon on top and they all looked so good! I was ready to dig in! They first bite was delicious it had such great flavor. I don\'t know wether they put tons of melted cheese on top but some rolls did have carne asada in them! It was a great combination of flavors. It was fun exploring this new sushi style. \n\nGreat environment and the restaurant was clean.', 'This place has the worst customer service!!

We ordered the Sushi Mocorito  Crab Roll  and Aguachile de Camarón and neither of those three plates satisfied the taste buds. Instead  I got a severely upset stomach. As soon as I took a bite from the Sushi Mocorito I was immediately put off by how soggy the rice was. Plus  the roll kept falling apart because it was soggy and way too big to eat in one bite. I also don't think they took into consideration the balance of flavors because you could really taste the Philadelphia cream cheese and store bought imitation crab. We were so disappointed at the first roll we didn't even touch the second roll. We then decided to move onto the Aguachile de Camarón. I've had aguachiles before and they're a good balance of spicy and lemon zest  but this plate didn't have that balance. It was too spicy to eat comfortably. No extra avocado or ketchup could tame the taste.\n\nCustomer service was also lacking. There was no greeting when we walked in. Also  we waited a few minutes only to grab our own menus to which the server finally saw us and said we could sit anywhere. From that moment on  she acted as if she was annoyed to see us there (mind you  we were the only customers dining in). Once we paid (which  in hindsight  we really shouldn't have)  she hovered over the table the whole time we were signing the receipts as in literally waiting to see what we would put down as tip. If you're a true sushi aficionado  I wouldn't recommend stopping by here. I left the restaurant only to immediately feel a wave of nausea  stomach cramps  and diarrhea for the rest of the evening.""]"

For those of you not familiar with the area  the location of this business is absolutely amazing. Two major crossroads in Scottsdale  great traffic from big stored next door and quite simply  a great little place.\n\nHowever  keep in mind that people shop with their eyes. That said  when you walk into a business  that first impression makes a huge impact on many things. Let me give you a summary:\n\nWhen you walk in  you'll see that they have turned the place into a warehouse to keep all of their inventory (drinks  food  plastic cups  napkins  etc...) but instead of having a designated storage room for that  everything is just all over the place (around the tables  vending machine  register  counter  etc...). My advice to the owners/managers is simple. Please keep the place organized  make it look like a place to eat and make people want to sit down and enjoy a nice meal over there. One of the employees was cutting veggies on one of the tables for customers. I really hope they take my review as good feedback and not as bad feedback. They have so much potential  a little organization  clearing up and cleaning up with go insanely far.\n\nThe food itself isn't bad at all. Prices are affordable and they have a huge menu  you can pretty much eat anything Chinese that comes to mind there! I've never had an issue with the food  but I always get it to go."", ""This place is my guilty pleasure. I find myself ordering at least once a week. House Lo Mein (no vegetables)  house soup (or hot and sour) and a couple egg rolls. The delivery guy knows my house and my dogs. The ordering  paying  and tipping online makes it super easy. They are super busy most of the time (cause it's really good)  so be patient... Or do what I do and order before you get home. Keep up the great work guys!"", ""Having an Asian wife  I am pretty snobby when it comes to Chinese food. I also grew up in NY so I know what real Chinese food taste like. No not all NY Chinese food is good but  when your wife is Asian and lived in NY as well  you know where to go. \n\nYummy Yummy is just that  Yummy. It's good American Chinese food  the stuff I used to get on Long Island in the local Chinese take out before I  met my wife.  I thoroughly enjoyed and  will most definitely be back. Service was fast too."", ""For reasonably priced American-style Chinese takeout available later at night than most other Chinese restaurants in the area  this hit the spot.

I'm no expert on the Phoenix/Scottsdale dining scene  as I don't live in Arizona  but I assume one can find better Chinese food in the area  at least during normal dining hours. But as far as run-of-the-mill Chinese takeout goes  this is decidedly above average."", 'Great food  friendly staff and food was ready in a timely fashion. Would recommend to anyone in the area.', ""Ordering from Yummy Yummy was a waste of money.  First of all everything smelled and tasted like fish  although there was no fish in our order. My bet is that the oil they fried our chicken and wonton was not the best quality and probably been used thousand times before. Trying their egg drop soup was an exciting experience.

The 1st time he ordered the orange chicken.  I tried it and it was ok  but 1 bite was enough for me and I ended up sharing some of my tofu dish with him.  The 2nd time he ordered yellow curry chicken.  It was bland in every aspect   The color of the curry sauce was dull  the spice and flavor of the curry was light  and the consistency of the curry sauce was watery.  The chicken had a weird taste and texture and he ended up only eating a few bites and I had to give up a big portion of my tofu.  Later that night he started complaining about not feeling well  and ended up getting sick.  He normally has a strong stomach.\n\nSo  Yummy Yummy  I will be fair and give you 3 stars strictly for your tofu dishes.

Supplied with plenty of soy sauce and utensils. Arrived in less time than the app suggested. Would order again."", 'Very interesting little place. Service was meh but the food was even worse. Some of chicken I got did not look very edible. I picked through it and only ate the vegetables. Will probably never go back', ""Not even gonna front...this place is legit. Pan fried dumplings = best around and probably a contender for best fried dumplings for value anywhere. Plump  delicious meaty  and may be a tad bit oily but dabbing with napkins or setting on napkins will help this. Great dumplings! \n\nYang chow fried rice on point. Not salty  not mushy but flavorful and hearty as it should be. The lo mein is also hearty and plentiful. The beef fried rice also the same. The one thing I need to point out is this place does NOT skimp on the meat. Perhaps a little too much in fact  which is never a bad thing. Generous portions and even healthier portions of chicken/beef/protein! \n\nI also ordered mapo tofu and was super surprised at how not oily it was and normally you don't get soft tofu but you do here. \n\nI like the attention to detail and the friendly service and delivery came way in advance of expectation."", ""Disclaimer: I am a vegetarian. \n\nFive stars for their tofu dishes \n\nI have been looking for Yummy Yummy for about 8 years since my favorite Asian place in Flagstaff closed. \n\nVegi Food: I have had two dishes here so far and both were excellent. I ordered the Mongolian Beef (no beef sub tofu) and Sesame chicken (no chicki sub tofu). What makes this place stand out above 99% percent of Asian restaurants is that they lightly bread their tofu and fry it. The bread coating is an absolute must have to enhance the tofu. I can stomach plain cold tofu right out of the container but if you give it to me breaded and fried  then I am ecstatic. One note  if you get a tofu dish  I recommend dining in because the breading usually gets moist and soft if not eaten immediately. The vegetables are also very fresh here and not overcooked  I would almost describe my broccoli in the sesame tofu as raw or lightly steamed.\n\nAmbiance: Nice or Normal  not much to expect from a strip mall restaurant. \n\nMy brother and cousin both had meat dishes  General Tso's chicken and Happy Family. They both enjoyed their meat dishes. \n\nI highly recommend the vegetarian dining here and its the best quick Asian I have found in the Scottsdale & Thomas area."", ""Ordered take out of chicken fried rice  chicken lo mein and orange chicken. It was ready when I got there  and it was still hot when I got home. The 3 entrees was so much food that we made two full meals for two people. It was so delicious! I will definitely be back. I really enjoyed the flavors. Everything was salted just right  no over powering flavors and it wasn't too sweet either. It was just right. I loved it! Very authentic to what I grew up eating."", ""I like this place. I placed an order to go. Service was quick and friendly and the place seemed pretty clean. The Hot and Sour soup was not very hot or sour (fixed with chili oil and white vinegar at home). The ingredients were quality though  you could tell the mushrooms were fresh and not from a can. The pork dumplings were clearly from scratch  and they were good. I ordered the spicy beef. It wasn't very spicy but the ingredients were quality again  seemed fresh and the veggies hand cut. Next time I'll ask for extra spicy and see how it goes."", ""My opinion of this establishment is seriously tainted by the two and a half hours I had to wait to receive my food. Once my food arrived it was lukewarm at best  leading me to believe it spent quite some time sitting somewhere. The hot and sour soup once heated was good  the Pad Thai was not; very slimy. My boyfriend ordered general tsos chicken  which was good and good portion. All in all  I'll go somewhere else for Chinese food."", ""Was surprised this was not horrible.  It's right next to the Blockbuster and Jamba Juice I'm at fairly regularly and in a mad dash for dinner one night got take out there.  Is it authentic?  Not really  its got a mashup of Chinese-American items where most of the proteins are covered in batter and fried.  It has some Thai dishes.  The owner is Chinese from Hong Kong.  I'm hoping that if I go back a few times and order in Chinese  the dishes might come out a little less MSG filled.  An order of ten crab rangoons  and two dinner combos came out to $20 bucks.  Not bad for a last minute desparation dinner.  I'd really like more vegetables with my entrees  but the to go container was packed full of food.  The fried rice is standard soy-sauce colored rice with bits of egg.  The sauces were not too sweet (although shockingly red with food coloring).

I'm getting sick of Totties and am not a fan of the Tottie's service/price."", 'This used be be one of my absolute favorites places to order Cromwell.

They changed the way the lunch comes (meat and veggies used to come in a small plastic bowl and the rice in the little take out box. Now it\'s all in a small bowl with literally a scoop of meat and veggies in a bowl full of rice.). When I called to ask about it the lady said she ""I don\'t know anything  I just work here. There is no manager. Oh he\'ll be here tomorrow  no we are closed tomorrow"". And now you have to ask for utensils as well.

I have found something I like and stick to that  chicken and broccoli and crab Rangoon..  I've had better crab puffs butt I've also had worse  they are a little sweet but the ratio is perfect. The chicken and broccoli is a little to saucy but no bad enough to make me never come back and the broccoli is always cooked perfectly. Egg rolls are sub par.

But  either it\'s hit or miss  or their ""new management"" actually has improved things.\n\nI tend to order a lot of fried  filled foods when I order chinese  and this place did it right!  I had crab rangoon  pork filled wontons  and an eggroll  and all were fantastic!  The eggroll was gigantic and very crisp  and the rangoon and wontons were crisp with a good amount of filling.  Usually when I order these things  the rangoon is soft and mushy  and the wontons are mostly breading.  So  I was excited that this was not the case.  \n\nMy sesame chicken tasted like every other order of sesame chicken I\'ve ever had.  I was not a fan of the fried rice that accompanied it.  It tasted kind of like I would expect feet to taste.  My boyfriend had chicken chow mein and orange chicken with the sauce on the side  and he was a fan of both.  Service was accurate and prompt  although  I asked for ""lots"" of sweet and sour sauce  and they gave me one small container of it  no more than they normally give.\n\nIn conclusion  will I go here when I want a gourmet dinner?  No.  But  will I crave this when I\'m hungover and don\'t want to leave my apartment on a Sunday evening?  Absolutely!

It\'s not A+ quality like a great sit-down Chinese restaurant  but I don\'t expect that in delivery received in 20 minutes. The spare ribs were great  with just the right amount of fat and no grizzle. The orange chicken was over-breaded but still good  and it came with some fresh  crisp broccoli. The coconut shrimp comes with a really interesting creamy sauce that\'s a nice change from sweet and sour. I also loved the fried rice with the unusual addition of bean sprouts. \n\nI will mention though  that the first time I ordered  the man who came to give me my delivery  which I had paid for by credit card using the Yelp app  told me ""you pay tip in cash.""

Here\'s the low-down:\nMu-Shu Pork: Very disappointed.  The flavor was slightly fake in nature and had a strange/not good aftertaste.  It was also missing the sweet sauce it usually comes with that makes it delectable.\nFried Dumplings: Were very tasty  but the dough was VERY thick.  I felt my arteries closing while eating them.\nFried Pork Roll: Also very tasty  but VERY greasy.  You can tell you\'re eating something fried.\nThai Panang Curry with beef: Very tasty  BF gobbled it up without much communication.  It wasn\'t exactly the flavor he was looking for  wanting more of the curry flavor  but it was good enough for him to finish it in record time.\nChicken and broccoli: The chicken tastes fake with that chewy consistency that most chinese places boast in their ""chicken"" dishes making me wonder whether I\'m eating chicken...or some other white meat...the broccoli was fresh and crisp even if it was doused in too much sauce.\nWon Ton Soup: Had plenty in my time and this was just wrong. It tasted as if they made it with butter  which turned me off instantly.\nOtherwise a pretty uninspiring meal.  Ended up throwing most of it away.  2 stars for the 2 dishes that were ok.', 'We have had a really hard time finding any good delivery Asian food since we moved here. For delivery  Yummy Yummy has good food for a great price. The chicken and veggies are always fresh and we have been thrilled the 3 times that we have ordered from them.', 'I would like to begin this review by saying that I went to it with an open mind. I had been wanting to go try this place out since I came home one day to find a menu taped to my front door.\nAll the dishes were priced reasonably and the restaurant was about five minutes from my apartment.\nI read all the reviews on here before going  and upon seeing that they were mostly mixed reviews I decided to go and check it out once and for all. The menu states clearly at the top that the place is under new management  and from what I know  that usually means that the place should be running better than ever.\nNot in this case.\n\nWhen I first got there  I noticed that there weren\'t very many people in the restaurant besides a couple sitting in one of the booths. There were two gentlemen ahead of me  the first had a large take-out order  the second ordered to dine-in. \n\nMy turn came to order. All I wanted was Chow Mein with Beef. Simple enough  right? I had to repeat my order to the girl behind the counter four times  on the fourth I pointed to the menu where the Chow Mein choices were featured. She nodded and then asked me if I wanted a large or a small dish. I asked her how big the containers were and she didn\'t seem to understand what I was asking. I asked her again  slowly  and she nodded and pointed at the containers behind her. I ordered a small  it seems like a good proportion. I paid my $11  got my drink  and sat down at a booth.\n\nThe surface of the table was sticky  but I chalked it up to the waiting staff just having overlooked it. I wiped the surface with a napkin and waited for my food to arrive. An older Asian woman approached me with a plate full of food  and I was impressed with how quickly she brought it over. She said something that I didn\'t understand and I asked her to repeat it. Finally  I realized she was saying Kung Pow Chicken. I shook my head and told her that I hadn\'t ordered that. She insisted that the chicken was my order  despite the fact that the gentleman who had been in front of me at the register was waving her over  claiming the dish as his.\n\nThe lady laughed and took it over to him.\n\nThe girl who took my order came back over to ask me what I had ordered  and I repeated my order to her. She smiled and said she would go tell them in the kitchen. \n\nA young Asian man  after another five minutes of waiting  brought me a paper plate with beef and broccoli. He put in front of me and before I could say thank you  he said  ""Sorry  not yours"" and walked away.\n\nThe older Asian lady came out once more and brought me the same dish that the boy had just brought over and said this was my order. I asked her what it was and she said that it was what I ordered. I asked her if this was Chow Mein with Beef because from what I could see  there were no noodles anywhere to be seen. The lady pointed to the girl and said that she told her I had ordered what she put before me.\n\nI should probably say that I hardly ever make a big deal about not getting exactly what I want at a restaurant  but everyone at this restaurant seemed to be clueless as to what I had ordered even after I repeated the order multiple times.\n\nI told the lady that I had not ordered the beef dish she placed in front of me. I thanked her and told her to forget it. I stood up to leave and she told me to sit down  quite rudely  and that she would get a manager. I shook my head and told her that it was fine  it wasn\'t a big deal  but that I was leaving. She kept telling me to sit down  very loudly now  and she ran back to the kitchen.

So after dinner at Noodles Ranch last week  I picked up a menu from this place.\n\nAnd when my hunger struck this evening  I decided to call in and place an order for take out.  Good thing I decided to take out instead of eat in  because this restaurant has no ambiance at all.  It was empty on a Saturday night and reminded me of the fast food Chinese places you see at food courts in malls.  The people working there were not very welcoming either... and when I suggested they add an eggplant dish to the menu  they basically just said \'no\' without even entertaining the idea.\n\nWhen I came home with my bag  I noticed that they didn\'t include chopsticks  utensils  napkins  soy sauce or fortune cookies.  What Chinese restaurant have you ever been to that didn\'t have fortune cookies?  \n\nAnyways  I ordered the Mu Shu Vegetable and the Mixed Vegetable with Shrimp in the ""Health Food Section"" of the menu.  I probably would not describe either dish as ""yummy yummy "" but they were satisfactory. The portions were large and the vegetables were fresh  but the garlic sauce that came with the shrimp dish was pretty nasty.  \n\nI would possibly give this place another chance in the future for take-out in a pinch  but I\'d highly recommend hitting up Noodles Ranch  Tottie\'s  or Lao Thai if you\'re wanting yummy yummy Asian food instead.', ""For the amount of food that you get  I don't see why people are complaining. You do get a lot of food. Obviously with take out Chinese Food it is hit-or-miss and from what I have ordered  the food is good enough to go back.

It is moderately priced and I still order from here once or twice a month."", ""I don't generally leave reviews but I felt I really needed to in this instance. My family has done takeout twice now (in one week) and they were extremely quick and the food is amazing. Seriously the best Chinese I have found in the area and I've lived in this area for almost a decade! I love the fact that they don't drench the sweet and sour chicken and keep the sauce separate  the chicken was super crunchy and not soggy. Egg rolls are huge and super delicious.  I don't know why anyone would leave a bad review  the staff are friendly and the food is flavorful and so yummy!"", ""Don't really know where to begin.

I got the chicken fried rice  two orders of crab rangoon's (labeled as puffs)  a can of soda  white steamed chicken with white rice and sweet and sour sauce. My girlfriends steamed chicken came with no rice and it was a pretty small bowl of chicken. All of that was disappointing considering it was $10 alone!! She took one bite of it and spit it out saying it was disgusting and slimey. It quickly went in the trash. My chicken fried rice was unlike ANY I've had. There were a ton of vegetables in there that were not expected or wanted. I've never had any fried rice that had these. It was like lo mein with rice. I TRIED picking around them but it was impossible. It seemed it would be good without them but I'll never try again to see. The crab rangoon's were not warm at all nor crispy. Not one item of our food was pleasant! NOTHING!\n\nI have been desperate for some yummy Chinese since I moved to Arizona and Yummy Yummy Chinese definitely doesn't live up to its name!!! The only thing I kept were the rangoon's but I'm pretty sure those will get tossed eventually from being uneaten. We were wanting to try and venture out and it was a regret!

I made it very clear to the girl I wanted extra egg in my chicken fried rice several times  even paid extra for it.  When I got home I got rice and onions.

Dry hush puppy looking things next to rice with a big styrofoam dish of sweet & sour sauce on the side. WTF? Don\'t they know that S & S is an American Chinese dish and requires particular ingredients? For the record  I was simply told: ""this how we serve this"". And the Chicken teriyaki? God awful chunks of gristly dark meat  some with skin  swimming in a watered down sauce of some sort? Thank God the egg rolls were edible  as I had not eaten all day. And NOT cheap. Crab Rangoon? How do you screw this up  well  I\'ll tell you. You put 1/8th of a teaspoon of cream cheese in a wonton wrapper and fold it into one large triangle and soak it in grease.

I absolutely loved the sauces on the chicken and beef  although the orange sauce could stand to have a bit of spice. The batter on both dishes wasn't soggy and was still light and fluffy.\n\n As to the meat vs batter ratio I've been seeing some of the reviews complain about  I didn't see what they were talking about  the amount of meat compared to the batter was about average for that sort of batter. As for the portion sizes  they're larger than what I'm used to when getting take-out Chinese (Think 2-3 portions from Panda Express per single entree plate) so the price is pretty spot on considering what you're getting.

I ordered it to go  took it home and began digging into it without really examining it.  I noticed some lumpy stuff  but just thought it to be clumps of rice and kept eating.  The sauce was flavorful  I was starving...and then my girlfriend asked if I was eating meat.  I realized then that the lumpy stuff was not clumps of rice or some other non-meat thing but rather some kind of unidentifiable meat.  I have never seen a non-vegetarian Ma Po Tofu before -- a dish that generally screams ""vegetarian.""  Needless to say  I stopped eating immediately.  Unfortunately  I had consumed a good amount of food before realizing that it had meat in it.

Other places its usually all three for the lunch menu. \n\nI ordered shrimp with garlic sauce and a large hot and sour soup because that's what I really came for and I can seriously put away Chinese food. It took what seemed like at least 10 minutes so I'm starting to think that it will come out fresh and incredible. You can see where they're cooking...looks like they're hard at work back there.\n\nThe person who took my order at the register brings the soup first then the plate of food. I hadn't noticed until I got the food but they have buckets of silverware on the table. I wasn't sure if they were used or not  but they looked used. However there were so many on each table that certainly they all couldn't have been used. I was also kind of taken aback that they serve on styrofoam plates. No big deal just that I hadn't seen that in a long time.\n\nI start eating the shrimp with garlic sauce. I quickly find that I don't detect any garcle whatsoever. Maybe because I love garlic and they only put enough in for a normal person. I don't know. I also soon find that it tastes like one of those microwaveable Chinese meals I could have gotten at the store a couple hundred feet away from their frozen section. Ah well  I eat it all anyway.\n\nI get to the hot and sour soup: again  what I had really come for because I had been craving it for some time and has become my measuring stick for Chinese places. First slurp: no flavor. Nothing. Ok? I put some soy sauce. Kind of better. So I'm eating it  watching a little of their TV as I go when I noticed something strange. I don't know if it was uncooked egg or some sort of gellatanous goup but there was some clear junk in the soup. I already paid for it and I got the impression they wouldn't care if I told them  so I scoup it out and put on my plate. I continue eating the soup and find more and more. And what I think was chicken in there starts to resemble children's fingers that may have slipped in. This is no bueno!\n\nAnother thing. Their drinks. They give you a styrofoam cup to fill yourself which is cool  but they don't have a lid for that size. Makes me think they purposefully did this so you wouldn't take any drink with you.\n\nI work around here and this could have been my go to place but I won't ever be coming back. It makes my stomach feel weird just thinking about what I ate. I hope I don't get sick later on.\n\nYes  it could have been a bad day for them.

The sink in the men's washroom was also disgusting.  The place was unorganized  a few booths looked like a make shift supply closet."", ""Big mistake ordering something with meat in this dive. The veggie fried rice is still good  but this is possibly the worst version of white meat chicken in the history of white meat chicken. It is slimy  and yellow color and inedible. This is what junky Chinese places do to your poultry. It must cost them a dollar around or I'm not even sure where this stuff comes from. An absolute mess. If you have any self respect and trust me a little  please do not order the chicken here. That chicken was in a dish of thin rice noodles which were equally disgusting. They tasted like someone throw a coating of old fish sauce on them and then served them up right from the ocean. It reeked of fish oil and juice and it was an injustice to serve this stuff to the public. Fried rice be damned  I'm taking my business as far away as possible from this punk ass fake ripoff place.

So I ordered the only option I had tofu and mixed vegetables in a brown soy sauce  and requested they add cashew nuts.  He informed me that it would be $2  and I said that was fine.  When our food arrived  my dish had no cashew nuts... ""Boo""  it also had no flavor whatsoever ""Ick"".  In fact  after taking a few bites  I began to be concerned about the quality of the food  as it was loaded with veggies and sauce  and really had no flavor at all...something was wrong here.   I ate about 5 bites total and threw it away  I didn\'t want to risk getting sick over it. Hottie did the same and we ate a few pieces of cheese for dinner instead.  Needless to say we won\'t be back.', 'Slimy chicken. \nMushy rice. \nThe spicy orange chicken was not spicy and did not taste like orange chicken.  \n\nThe massive egg roll was the only saving grace  the rest is sadly inedible.', ""I have not visited this actual location  I've only used them for delivery via the grubhub app. Their delivery food is mediocre at best - they brought me no chopsticks  the house fried rice has so many ingredients you can't taste any of them.

And i will be sure to order the foods w/ the prices are shown."", ""Pallucci is a quaint Italian restaurant located in the Mount Pleasant/Davisville area.  If you weren't a local  you probably wouldn't know it was here.  The decor is simple but modern and the servers are all very friendly.  The main colours of the restaurant are blue and red and the lighting creates a great ambiance  with lit candles lining the rear wall.  Upstairs houses 2 of its private dining areas which accommodate groups of 20-50 guests.     There is plenty of free street parking nearby - just one of the perks of being away from restaurants in the downtown core.\n\nThe menu has a good selection of Italian dishes.  I did fell however  that the entrées list was a bit small - especially if you weren't really up for pizza or pasta.\n\nThe house wine was courtesy of House Wine Co. featuring both the Red House (a blend of Shiraz and Cabarnet) and the White House (a blend of Riesling and Pinot Grigio).  These are both wines from the Niagara region  and I highly recommend them.  The server was even kind enough to bring over the bottle so we knew what it looked like before we head to the LCBO.  Wine purists may be scoffing at me  but I like hybrids!\n\nThe starter bread basket was warm  and probably one of the better breads I've had in Toronto.  For starters  it was warm.  It got a sprinkling of salted herbs and a dousing of balsamic vinegar.  It was hard not to devour the entire thing.  The bread was perfectly crusty as if it were fresh out of the oven.\n\nWe opted to share a Spinach Salad ($10) which was tossed with a halved egg  cherry tomatoes  red onion and shaved Parmesan cheese.  I found the leaves to have been awkwardly big  and the salad itself was pretty bland.  The saving grace were the freshly toasted walnuts.\n\nFor mains I opted for the meat special  a Peppercorn Striploin served with a generous portion of sweet potato fries (which I substituted in place of regular fries).  I loved that Chef Neil Siomra placed the steak on top of the bed of fries as the jus just trickled down and gave the fries great flavour.  The steak was cooked to my requested medium-rare  but unfortunately a bit lacking in the seasoning department.  The meat itself had no real flavour and relied heavily on the peppercorn sauce to spruce it up.  The sweet potato fries were absolutely divine  not too oily  and thin-cut just the way I like them.  I'd come here just to have these again.\n\nMy dining companion opted for the pasta special which was a Snow Crab Ravioli topped with grilled shrimp. The tomato sauce was very fresh.  I would've preferred if the ravioli were cooked just a tad more.  The crab was virtually absent or drowned out by the rich cheese filling as I couldn't discern any of the lumpy meat while eating this dish.\n\nTo finish off the evening we opted to share the Raspberry & Chocolate Tartufo ($7).  While it took awhile for the actual dessert to show up  it was well worth the wait.   The thin shell had a great texture to it - it reminded me of an Italian mochi with its slightly elastic exterior that was lightly dusted with cocoa powder.  The interior filling was dense and rich  with a raspberry centre.\n\nVerdict:\n\nThe staff at Pallucci make you feel like you're in nana's house.  They're warm  and serve you with a smile.  They were always around if you needed something  and quick to remove your plates when you've finished.  I must also thank Chef Siomra for bringing us 2 separate plates of salad even though we were sharing.\n\nThe food here doesn't leave you feeling heavy  and is very fresh.  With that said  the food could benefit from a bit of flavour development."", '3.5 stars!\nI went here with my gf because she had a craving for risotto and I hear this restaurant made some good ones.  We started with the caprese salad and squid salad.  They were both excellent but the squid portion was a bit small. Still tasted fantastic.  Then she had a beef and mushroom risotto which was pretty damn good.  Dessert was also fantastic  the creme brûlée inside was custardy and the top crispy as it should be.  If you want good food they have it but my only issue was the lack of people  especially on a Friday night.', ""What a gem!!  My husband and I LOVE Pallucci.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to get Chris (and most are) service is a 5+!  He knows his stuff  is happy to recommend  and sets a great pace for your meal.  \n\nAmbiance is cozy and comfortable - never too loud.  \n\nFood is excellent!  So much to recommend.  The sweet potato fries with balsamic glaze are a must.  The funghi salad is sooooo good  and my husband swears by the caprese with bocconcini.  Last time we went I had the tuna spacial and it was delicious!!  Everything is fresh and prepared to your liking.\n\nThis is a great neighborhood spot......give it a try!"", ""Came for dinner  $70 coupon clutched in hand. One server--the owner--coping with a growing crowd and doing very well. House wine is cheap and good  appetizers (warm funghi salad) excellent  but my steak frites was way overdone and piled atop what looked like frozen fries. My wife's pasta ($17) was  she said  very good. Our shared dessert--a lime tart--was excellent. So overall  pretty good.""]"

Nothing amazing to say the least but did bring a smile \'cause it was THE Heart Attack Grill. \n\nBurger - was actually pretty good. I got the double-bypass cheese burger which I killed in 10mins. Should have gotten the triple. It came nicely put together and I added tomato  pickles  red onions  and mustard\n\nFries - ....eh. sounds amazing fried in lard  but was under par for me. was kinda limp  wasn\'t crispy and i think the few batches that were in the tray were over cooked. loved the fry bar concept though.\n\nExperience - wasn\'t as expected  granted that we went for lunch on a Tues  the waitresses weren\'t exactly ""hot"" (like on TV...LOL) they were very friendly and attentive tho. I would think the best times would be more the weekends. if you want that experience and ""eye-candy""\n\nif you love burgers...like experiencing themed places. definitely check this place out at least once. i hope to return one day... on a weekend.\n\nMy overall  rating is 3.5 stars. :)', 'If it was possible to give this place a half of a star  I would. Tacky  unattractive waitresses. Poor concept. And the fact they are actually promoting poor health is extremely sad.  But then a again the owner is short and bald which explains everything.

If based on food alone  it would get a 3  but the eye candy made it dabateable for a 5 star review. \nService was fast and friendly. All beautiful girls working. No guys  even the cooks were dressed in nurse outfits and booty shorts. \nAnywhere I can order a burger (1/2lb - 2lbs)  eat endless fries  take three shots of  Patrón and watch my burger get cooked by a gorgeous woman in basically a thong  is a place worthy to eat at.  Oh  if you eat the quadruple bypass burger (4-1/2lb patties) the ""nurse"" wheels you to your car in a wheelchair!!!\n\nGo here  at least once- it\'s fun!', ""The Heart Attack Grill is definitely one of the gems of the valley. For all of the negative reviews about the food being greasy and bad for you  I'm not sure what you were expecting. They are exactly what they advertise - a deliciously quick trip to the grave. The burgers are dripping with lard  making them tantilizingly juicy. Of course this is not the place for someone looking for a light  healthy lunch  but for those of us who enjoy indulging in what might be our last meal  a double bypass burger is a worthy choice. \n\nPersonally i love the gimmick of the naughty nurses (who i may add are more than willing to sit on your lap while you sweat through a burger and fries) and Dr. Jon.\n\nThe Heart Attack Grill is well deserving of their recent fame. Ignore the whiners and try it out!"", ""I saw the Heart Attack Grill on television and knew they had scantily clad nurses and lard induced food. What you don't realize is the restaurant is really going for more than the lard version of Hooters.  They want to give you the feeling that you are eating in a strip club.  By that  I'm not suggesting that the nurses are inappropriate or wearing too little clothing. It's just that you walk in and they have long tables shaped like a bar with stools. It's like a cheap inside joke  they are TRYING to be the ultimate guys hangout: lard burgers and fries  waitresses who are dressed like stripper nurses  no veggies  no diet coke   all the lard drenched steak fries you can eat  corona's and regular coke served in bottles.  \n\nYeah  I'm fine with all of that and I understand this place is going for that theme. \n\nSo in short  the concept is fun but the execution is horrible. Here are the problems\n\n1. Food: the burgers tasted as if they went to Food City and bought the cheapest meat they could buy and dump it in some lard. The lard didn't not make the food taste any different with the exception that I felt really full and heavy at the end of my meal. The food was very disappointing. \n\n2. Scantilly clad women in nurses outfits are fine as long as the women wearing the outfits are attractive. That wasn't the case here. They are not even Hooters quality in terms of attractiveness.\n\n3. Yes  I want greasy food but I don't want to feel like I'm standing next to the fryer as I eat the food. The floor had so much grease that had condensed from the air that I almost slipped several times. The place had a bad odor and it just stank from the lard. You felt like you were eating in the kitchen.\n\n4. Lack of service: the nurses chat with you and are friendly but they don't serve you. It's like Fudruckers. You get your own fries. You put toppings on your own burger. You fill out your own order/check at the end. The waitress only takes your drink order and points to a wall and aks you to pick out a burger\n\n5. Scary crowd: the people eating at the restaurant reminded me of people on the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. We are talking major rednecks here!  It was mostly middle aged guys sitting by themselves and eating as if they were at a strip club I also saw a bunch of kids eat here and they looked as if they running moonshine between Kentucky and Ohio in the 1920's.\n\n6. No credit cards.  They have an ATM in the place if you lack cash\n\n7. Expensive.  I paid 14 dollars for a beer and a burger.  For the cheap a$#$ environment  you woud think the prices would be less but you"", 'I travel with a competitive speech team. We were recently in Arizona for a competition  and my team HAD to stop at the Heart Attack Grill- a member of my team is doing a speech about it  we couldn\'t get away without seeing the place firsthand!\n\nUpon arrival  we were immediately greeted by a smell that can accurately be described as ""Fat  grease  and charred death."" You know the smell that sometimes comes out of a burger restaurant- the slightly-singed  but otherwise-delicious smell of meat being grilled? This was a sick amplification of that. The smell alone was enough to drive several members of our party to pursue other options for dinner.\n\nAs far as decor  the restaurant does a good job of sticking to an anti-doctor theme  with signs plastered all over the restaurant warning you of the unhealthy nature of their food  mandatory patient gowns for all diners  and waitresses dressed as cute nurses. \n\nBut the food itself could be summed up with the word ""Sickening "" which actually works metaphorically and literally. Their shakes are incredibly sweet  but actually filled with ice cream  pure cream  and butter. Their fries are cooked in lard  and their burgers are excessively heavy and fattening. A burger and fries is really enough to fill up a fully-grown man  but the sensation of being completely filled by lard  meat  and grease is almost as disgusting as seeing one of the obese regulars scarf down a triple-bypass burger for free.\n\nThe next morning  most of us who\'d eaten there were still full. One of my friends said he ""felt like [he] just blew the Hamburglar."" Starting with the smell  and lasting all the way to the aftertaste the next morning  this anti-hospital is as novel as it is grotesque and excessive. I seriously almost threw up twice before I even tried anything  but I like to exercise and eat healthy. Other people didn\'t seem as disturbed by the place as I did  and to HG\'s credit  the things they serve actually maintain a stronger semblance to edible food than some other places I\'ve eaten. It will definitely fill you up  and the theme is kind of cute.\n\nNonetheless  I can\'t walk away from a restaurant feeling like I just destroyed my body and recommend it. I almost feel like the place is unethical for its  choice to give such flagrantly unhealthy meals. At the same time  the place is called HEART ATTACK Grill  and they don\'t make any effort to pretend they\'re doing anything other than providing the most unhealthy and disgusting food possible. With that  and the friendly service in mind  I can\'t justify any rating lower than 2/5. I\'d definitely like this place more if they just used fresh ingredients  didn\'t cover everything in nastiness  and just stuck to making good burgers  fries  and shakes...\nbut I realized that would just make them In-N-Out  and would kind of ruin everything this restaurant stands for.\n\nDisgusting? Yes.\nNecessary? No.\nImmoral? Decidedly no  since they clearly warn you about what you\'re getting in to.\n\nI\'d eat here once  and NEVER again. It\'s a place fueled by novelty- go there only if you\'re inspired after watching Epic Meal Time on youtube.', 'Well I have to say that despite the negative/neutral reviews  I still wanted and needed to check this place out.  I do not like the comparision to Hooters since this place personalize the visit by the gowns and clinic theme\n\nThe food  service  atmosphere is awesome and truly highly recommend this place.', ""Heart attack grill offers a simple menu of burgers ranging from the Single Bypass Burger through the wheelchair-to-car-included Triple Bypass Burger and the unlisted Quadruple Bypass Burger.  In theory you could get your leftovers to go (and you will have leftovers) but in practice the staff recommends against this.  The single bypass burger is more burger than you care to eat.

The burgers are tasty  with lots of fixings (onion  lettuce  tomoto  special sauce  bacon  ...) but if you come here for the food you're missing the point.\n\nWaitstaff are dressed in slinky nurse's outfits  the gimmick of this prototype of what will prove to be a successful franchise business."", 'I am a sucker for a theme restaurant. I have been wanting to visit this place for a while because of their whole gimmick. When you arrive a nurse checks you in  gives you a hospital wrist band  and dresses you in a hospital gown. Seriously  I love a gimmick more than the next person but the Heart Attack Grill is 100% gimmick and only 60% good food. The menu consists of burgers which vary only in the number of patties  french fries fried in lard  shakes  pure sugar coke  and PBR. They have a strict no sharing policy which completely bummed us out because we wanted to order the huge 20 patty burger and split it 3 ways. We ordered 2 single bypass burgers (one of our trio boycotted the burger because of the no sharing policy ) all you can eat lard fries  a vanilla shake  full sugar coke and a PBR. The burgers were ordinary  the fries were ordinary  and the service (aside from being dressed as naughty nurses) was ordinary. The only win was the delicious butterfat filled vanilla shake. \n\nThe bill came to around $30  which is a bit pricey because remember only two of us actually had food. Yeah  yeah  yeah  I get it. It is a gimmick. Heart attack  fat  lard  waitresses dressed as nurses  cook dressed as doctors  sugar  beer...whatever. It gets old pretty fast.', ""There are quite a few unique things about this place  drinks are bottled water  bottled coke  Corona or Bud (there is no tap water as they have no glasses). There are really only two things on the menu  a burger (either Single  Double  Triple or Quadruple Bypass) with or without cheese and an endless order or fries. They had a toppings bar with pickles  jalapenos  tomatoes and onions but no lettuce (it's considered health food). There is mustard  mayonnaise  ketchup and vinegar but no hot sauce.\n\nFor $499 you can get a membership and can eat 3 meals a day every day of the year if you'd like. Another schitck they have is if you weigh in excess of 350 lbs your meal is on the house (you can eat there 3 times a day if you please). And there is currently an eating challenge for an individual to complete a Quadruple Bypass in a single sitting but I don't think you receive anything. They have the fasted time at around 2:30 minutes currently.\n\nI ordered a Single Bypass with cheese and the french fries. The fries were tasty but not nearly as crispy as I'd like. They were quite limp which actually made it somewhat hard to dip them in the ketchup. They were extremely fresh though  they cut and make them almost non-stop throughout the day. However they are fried in lard and are extremely greasy.\n\nThe burger was good but certainly nothing I couldn't whip up at home. Mine was slightly undercooked for my liking but not enough to have them recook it. They use a 70/30 beef to fat patty  which for me is too much. On top of that they add pork fat while cooking and dip the buns in  pork fat as well. As you can tell they're very much into excess here. For all the added calories there is not sufficient added taste.\n\nThe whole thing is over-the-top and cheesy but I guess you can say you come here for the experience more than anything and for that it's more than worth the $10 and the food is at least acceptable. It's really more of a show than anything else. I was hoping to get to see someone attempt the Quadruple Bypass but sadly I didn't get to witness one. It's somewhat strange but families  with young children  tend to eat here a lot too. I don't know how I'd feel about bringing my kids here  not quite the right place. The staff and the crowd was quite enjoyable. I'd eat here occasionally if I lived near by  if only for a good time.\n\nI have photos and a more in depth review on my personal blog."", 'Having heard of this place on TV (Food network  I think) and my son who goes to school in AZ  the whole family  including my vegetarian only wife  just \'had\' to try the place. \n\nI would say that the place pretty much lives up to its name as being a gut busting  caloric inducing burger joint. Not for the faint of heart  I just got a single burger (is that what they call them?)  fries  a coke  and shared my wife\'s Vanilla shake.  I must have ate/drank over 3k worth of calories in one sitting. \n\nI am an avid runner with a half marathon  10k\'s  etc under my belt and I just had to run a full marathon (26.2 miles) the next day to cleanse myself of what I ate the day before. I really didn\'t run a marathon the next day  but like one reviewer said  ""The next morning  most of us who\'d eaten there were still full."" \n\nWould I eat there again? Sure  next year as its a great place to go to check out if you are in the area  but part of your regular diet  no way! But don\'t think my review is all about hating the joint  it\'s a great place. I even talked to the ""doctor\' himself and had dreams of expanding. With America\'s gluttony  I think he might even be successful at it in places like Dallas  Memphis  Orlando  New Orleans  etc...San Francisco? Hmmm  all of us healthy foodies would drive him outta town :-)', 'Drove from LA to chander just to eat here and it did not dissapoint me. So worth the 12 hour round trip drive.', 'Hate to love it! Or  love to hate it! You probably won\'t be neutral about Heart Attack Grill.\n\nThe concept is simple enough: make it good  and to hell with calorie counting  cholesterol  and concerns about trans-fats. And they perform their purpose to perfection.\n\nThe burgers are made with 1/2lb patties. So if you go for the Quadruple Bypass  that\'s 2lbs of beef you\'ll be eating. Crazy. I played it safe and went for the Single Bypass. The beef is good and cooked to a perfect medium. The buns are soft (the ones on the burger) and fresh. Cheese was tasty. You add your own condiments up at the condiment area. These are high quality ingredients here!\n\nYes  the fries are fried in lard. And delicious! Imagine In-N-Out fries  but with actual flavor. Oh  the fries are unlimited too  so take advantage of that. I did. Just as soon as I ordered  I went up and had a heaping helping for an appetizer. Then more when my burger arrived.\n\nI made the mistake of trying to order a Diet Coke (they don\'t have it). My nurse just looked at me weird  like  ""You realize where you\'re at  right? And what you just ordered...?"" Humbly  I recanted  and changed my order to a regular Coke...which ruled! Why? Mexico  baby! The real-sugar kind of Coke...in a glass bottle! If you\'re gonna do it  might as well do it right.\n\nOverall  I kind of dig this place. I stayed away for months because I had certain preconceived notions about Heart Attack Grill that didn\'t turn out to be true. That and the name scared me to death. But  in reality  the gimmick is cute (why hate on a gimmick?)  and the food is actually really delicious. Heavy on grease  but delicious. I won\'t be a regular because I love my body (sorry heart!)  but I can see myself visiting again. The siren song of those fries alone will surely lead me back. So  yeah  I\'ll be back someday. As for now? Now  I\'m off to the gym......', ""This place is aces!!!

Were not disappointed with the real thing.  Friendly young ladies who looked good in their uniforms. Good service. Burgers weren't bad.

You hear so much about it  then you walk in the door and you feel underwhelmed. It seems a bit run down  the place has definitely seen better days. \nThe food has seen better days too. The burger wasn't anything to write home about. The fries were ok. Not bad  not good  just average. I did enjoy the strawberry shake  though. That was pretty above average. \nMy overall feeling? It's a tourist trap. Literally. Heaven help you if you don't have cash. Who doesn't take debit cards anymore? Seriously? And the price is pretty absurd. If I'm paying that much for something  your establishment should look better for sure  and the food should be of a higher caliber."", 'First off  I love In-N-Out so that\'s my baseline.  This is more of an experience restaurant than a good burger joint.  The burger was a little dry  and the fries were great for my first serving but soggy for the second.  But it\'s the atmosphere.  Our server was great- not super hot  but cute.  But very professional  stayed in her ""role"" for the expeience as our nurse and she took care of us.  I only got a single but was amazed at this girl across from us who must have weight a buck-o-five and she downed a double.  when she came in she was all cheerful but when she was done eating she looked all haggard... I guess that\'s a good thing.', ""My chest hurts.\n\nHeart attack grill is a fun idea and the theme is cool  but do I need to watch videos about the heart attack grill while I am sitting at the heart attack grill?  \n\nThe fries were really good.  I guess the lard makes the difference  also they were hot and salty  so that is a major plus.  \n\nThe burger was OK but not great.  I had the double  which is 1 lb. total.  The meat was alright  not awesome  not bad.  I would have preferred if they had more options (like bacon  different cheeses  grilled onions  onion rings to go on top  that type of stuff).  \n\nThe shake was meh.  I had to stir in my own chocolate syrup(!?)  and it was a little too thick to be refreshing.  I was really thirsty in the end.   \n\nAlso  my friend doesn't do red meat and there was nothing for her.  Come on  I know you have a theme going  but not offering anything at all is just kind of douche-y.

My cousin who also had to take a trip to the restroom also mentioned the decor: pictures of the waitresses above the urinals pointing down with quote bubbles joking about sizes. Genius.

From the moment I stepped into this burger joint  I just couldn\'t feel the good vibe in the air. Three friends and I went here on our way to our grand road trip from Chicago to Los Angeles to Las Vegas and back. The consequences of not coming here were that (1) we could have eaten some steak at Big Texan Ranch at Amarillo  TX and/or (2) we could have visited the Grand Canyon. Let\'s just say at the end  we would have rather done the other options instead. Although we still saw the giant chasm on our way home  we still missed out on some potentially good steak in Amarillo. So as soon as we walked in the HAG  I just had this weird feeling like when you\'re watching a scary movie and someone is about to die. But in this case  I walked in and had this feeling that these burgers aren\'t going to be that great.\n\nOne thought came to mind when I first heard of this restaurant: ""Hooters with Unhealthy Burgers?"" I decided to come here because this place was #39 on the Travel Channel\'s ""Chow Down Countdown"" list; also because the waitresses are dressed as naughty nurses. From the segment  the place looked like a party. It was quite the opposite when my friends and I went. It seemed dead  although to HAG\'s defense  we came there on a Tuesday at 6:30  2 hours before the restaurant closes. There were only two young nurses working as well as the head (older) nurse. The two young nurses were attractive but one of them was quite snobby. \n\nOK now to the burger. It was cooked real well and full of calories  lard  fat  and did I mention calories? I must say it was an ""okay"" burger but not in the ""Got to have again!"" category. With the unlimited fries that swam in lard  it\'s the same concept. I wasn\'t a big fan of getting my own condiments in the condiments bar. The same ""CNN Heart Attack Grill portion"" clips was being played over and over on a loop throughout their big screens  rather than them showing sports. The aroma of a real hospital and the smell of lard also didn\'t help the cause. \n\nI had the Triple Bypass Burger and I was only able to eat it halfway. Overall  I can try to justify my 2-star rating because in my opinion  these burgers were not that great to me. My three other friends would definitely agree with me. Let me explain: Keep in mind that we were driving from Chicago to pass by Chandler non-stop. I don\'t know about my friends but I came through HAG\'s doors after being in a car for over 24 hours on a lightly filled stomach. Maybe it was the lard fries or the sugar Coke filling me up a little  but I didn\'t get the satisfaction from eating half of my burger. I actually got a better satisfaction from eating a Big Mac throughout the years. When it comes down to it  you eat here once and you\'ll probably not come back again  unless (1) you weigh over 350 lbs. and can eat for free  (2) You have paid the $500 annual membership fee to have 3 daily paid meals  or (3) you just want to check out the ""nurses."" \n\nI think my friends still have not forgiven me for taking them here. But to me  it\'s one of those  ""Place wasn\'t so great  but I\'m glad I still came here for I would have never known how it is."" The Heart Attack Grill just didn\'t fill me up in the right way.', 'I am in the area for a baseball camp and my buddy suggested that we visit the Heart Attack Grill for their famous quadrupal bypass burger.  I wasn\'t in mood to eat it all so I got the double bypass burger.  Didn\'t finish it.  The texture of the burgers and bun and cheese got to me so I stopped eating.  My friend finished the quadrupal and took a picture with the nurse and doctor while sitting in the wheelchair.  \nThe more I think about this restaurant  the more I think that this is Arizona\'s version of Hooters (girls in skimpy clothing serving food that is just ok).  The fries there were a funny color...not golden brown.  We wanted to watch the game today but they have no tv.  Instead you get to watch a bunch of videos about the Heart Attack Grill as well as some old videos such as ""Fat"" by Weird Al  ""In the Navy"" by the Village People  and ""I Got You Babe"" by Sonny and Cher.  \nThe best thing I can say is that they serve Cokes in big glass bottles.  \nLots of creativity...but I think it is overkill.  At some point  you have to be concerned with the quality of food being served.\n\nOh yea  I forgot to mention that the cook is dressed in a scrubs  the waitresses are either in nurse outfits or scrubs  the owner was in a doctor\'s labcoat...and the customers...well  we get to wear gowns.', 'My husband  6-year old son  friends & their kids ended up eating lunch here last Sunday.

Also  it was a fun and unique atmosphere...made you feel OK to eat really  really bad for that one occasion.    I wouldn\'t recommend bringing kids normally but I like the hosptial aprons for their messes.\n\nOn the other side  the burgers were average to below average (the buns were good though) but better than a fast food joint.   I split one wtih my 6-year old son.  Our waitress was very nice and helpful  but if you are a guy looking for some super artificial hot chics to serve you (I\'m not) then you\'re at the wrong place.

When you are seated  everyone must put on a hospital robe before ordering. There are even mirrors behind the counter that are angled up for a view of the waitress's sexy nurse costumes. So far so good.... \n\nMy expectations were very high but they did nothing but disappoint with their burger.

The place was decked out nice  but you definitely are not coming to Heart Attack Grill for fat free food.\n\nThe menu was simple  4 different burgers to choose from  unlimited fries (which you can't share) drinks are tall bottle of Coke or water (guess that's the closest your getting to diet) or 2 types of bottled beers to choose from and a crazy thick milkshake.  The fixings for burgers are near the grill  you choose from pickles  onions  tomatoes and jalapenos; next to the fry station were also the condiments of catsup  mayo and mustard. \n\nI ordered a single bypass with cheese and of course the fries and a coke.  The fries I have to say are the best fries I have had in a long time  man they where good.

WRONG.\n\nThe waitress informs one of my buddy\'s that if he finishes some sort of monster glutton burger then the meal was on the house.  Well sometime later  after putting that entire burger away  we get the check and notice the burger was still on the check.  We bring it up with the waitress who beats around the bush.  We then ask for the manager  who was VERY non-compliant.  After the discussion turns into an argument (wow real professional on your part Heart Attack Grill)  he threatens to ""call the cops if we don\'t leave and we better or else he\'s going to jump over the counter and punch us in the face.""\n\nSO MUCH FAIL\n\nRegardless of whether the food was good or not (nothing spectacular)  I am NEVER going back there again nor would I recommend anyone else to do so.

Sorry  ladies.\n\n2) The burger itself isn\'t anything special. Greasy  yes. Premiumly priced  but nothing outstanding. For a greasy burger  I would totally recommend 5 guys (even though its a chain from VA - there\'s one in Fremont  CA now) over this place. \n\nOne highlight was definitely the bun (not necessarily the preparation). I\'d say a star was earning in the Yelp rating for this bun. The bun is a quality  flaky piece of bread... but even with a 1/2 LB single bypass  the poor bun couldn\'t hold up to the grease it was subjected to. \n\nThe fries were pretty good but again  greasy for the sake of being greasy. They are tasty but nothing special. \n\nI\'m lactose intolerant so I cannot comment on the whole buttermilk shakes thing.\n\nThe lard manifests itself in a greasiness that is still in your mouth after you\'ve eaten. \n\nIt\'s fairly decent marketing job (congrats to the owner) but honestly  it\'s a schtick that where you will go there once and laugh (kinda like Casa Bonita in Denver)... but it\'s not some place any (normal) person could go to regularly. Also  if you can eat for free because you are a big boy  you have no business going to this joint. The extra calories to be had here probably aren\'t worth the reduction in your life expectancy.\n\nVerdict: Good to try but NOT worth making a trip out here to dine.\n -g', 'I ate hear and the waitresses were cute but looked like they were on strung out on meth. The burger was good for the first 2 bites then the taste became very monotonous  I would not go here again.', 'Definitely the most unhealthy place to eat and they are proud of it.  Over 350 pounds and you eat for free.  Nurses are nice too.\n\nThe success here is built on their novelty  but with a little ingenuity it could be a real star attraction.\n\nCASH ONLY!!!!', ""I will just be straight upfront; are they unhealthy  yes!! Is the fries cooked in pure lard  yes! Is the coke made from real sugar  yes!\n\nBut you know what  even though this place is unhealthy it is defiantly a place to experience once in your life time. Where else can you go where waitresses dress up like nurses and serve you food  or doctors as cooks? A place where you have to where a hospital gown and a wrist band and there is no exceptions? Their really isn't any other place like this.\n\nIt is true though it is really bad for you it sure does taste good! So if your in need of a good burger and fries and an experience to go with it this is the place to go!"", 'Ever since this place opened up while I was attending ASU  I\'ve always been tempted to try it out. But my recent visit to Phoenix for birthday related festivities  and my new favorite TV show  Man vs. Food  inspired me to step up to the challenge!\n\nMy first visit to the Heart Attack Grill  I had to tackle the 8 000 calorie  Quadruple Bypass Burger; in honer of Adam and food challengers everywhere!\n\nFirst things first  the establishment is a riot! I can\'t picture people NOT having fun there. The outfits  the blood pressure machine  the margaritas... The atmosphere is incredibly fun.\n\nI had to get an order of their ""Flat-Liner"" Fries... never tasted deep friend lard before. But to be honest  I wasn\'t impressed. The photo on the menu made them look a lot more appetizing then I felt they were. I\'ve had better for a lot fewer calories... but because you get UNLIMITED Flat-Liner Fries  I\'m still satisfied.\n\nBut the hamburger... Amazing! One of the best hamburgers I\'ve tasted! Despite the size of this 2 lb. beast  I was able to wrap my jaws around it and take some full bites. Delicious! Cheese drips everywhere and flavor just explodes in your mouth.\n\nI was victorious with the challenge  despite being slow with time (took me 25 minutes... I heard the record is 1 min. 47 sec.). It definitely was a challenge. The first 10 minutes were cheese burger heaven. But by the end of the meal I was tired of eating  changing the flavor of hamburger with the occasional tomato or pickle (also  an excellent condiment bar to build your burger how ever you like it). But I persevered  and I was happily removed from the building by my sexy waitress Nurse Mary in a wheel chair.\n\nA thanks goes out to my friend Amberly who joined me and gave me support when I was slowing down. Her optimism definitely helped me finish this race.\n\nNext time  I will definitely order a smaller burger...', 'For the uninitiated  the place is called Heart Attack Grill and makes no secret of its active use of lard in everything they make. So for the girls in the audience (yes you  sissy boys who think lard is ""icky"")  this is food meant for people whose genes will still be around in a thousand years.\n\nTHE FOOD\n\nI had a double bypass  my buddy had a single bypass and so did my girlfriend. We also shared a basket of fries.\n\nThe burgers were as promised  meaty and greasy. There was no lack of cheese and the bun did not fall apart like Carl\'s Jr. buns always do. There is also no mistake that real meat was used in creation of this diet buster. The double bypass will certainly test the limit of an average person  but it is quite tasty to those of us that do not survive on soy-based diet. \n\nThe fries are unquestionably greasy  but are crispy and compare well to most fries out there. I\'d certainly choose these over In-n-Out fries.\n\nSETTING\n\nYes  the girls are scantly clad and keep your wait time pleasurable. Our waitress was quite friendly and spent quite a bit of time talking to us. So I understand why the girls are rating this place poorly. \n\nThe place was relatively full when we dropped by at 2 in the afternoon and people ranged from well dressed middle aged couples to never-use-the-shower early 20-somethings. And of course  a couple of drooling teenagers.\n\nI would give higher rating if the hours were more convenient for me.\n\nOVERALL: I can do this once every quarter or whenever I have a friend visiting from out of town. More often and your guts will hate you.', ""This was the second food adventure I had while visiting AZ for the past weekend with my friends.\n\nI'm not that big into burgers  but I had to try this place ever since I've seen it on the Travel Channel.  I was a little scared since this place cooks everything in LARD  but when in Rome...\n\nThis place gets a 2 stars for a couple of reasons.  First  the burger I had wasn't that great.  It tasted like a back yard bbq session.  I was expecting a little bit more.  Second  after we got done eating my other friends felt like crap the whole day.  I believe they spent some time with the porcelain seat back at our hotel...\n\nThe only thing that saved this place from the 1 star is the Fries and the Shakes.  The fries are pretty good and its bottomless.  Maybe it was the LARD it was cooked in but the fries had a unique taste.  The Vanilla Shake I had was good.  My friends had the Strawberry Shake and can attest to its goodness as well.\n\nThe best part of the Heart Attack Grill is........THE NURSES!  If it wasn't for them  I would have walked out of this place as soon as I bit into my burger.  Good Gimmick bad burger!"", 'Survival of thie fittest stays true again today. Order a bottomless fries and a water and just stare at the girls for an hour. 2 BUCKS.', 'Decided to meet some friends today for lunch...and frankly  heard enough about it to make me want to try it.\n\nReally  the only thing that earned the stars for me was the waitress.  She was funny  just engaging enough  and she actually made me feel as if she was interested in talking to me.  The fries were okay - but unlike the other reviews  I didn\'t taste much in them.  I\'m okay with a meal like this (blatantly unhealhy) once in a while...but this really wasn\'t worth the trouble.\n\nMaybe I am spoiled  but the burger was tasteless and the bun was soaked in butter but not toasted.  I really enjoy Diet Coke with any meal (I know  I know...not unhealthy) and had to settle for water.  The fries were not cooked through (you know  when they are hard in the middle but soft on the outside)...and just not worth it.\n\nAnd  really  I hate the ""cash only"" places.

Simplified menu makes the place more of a novelty and gimmicky. The burger was good  the bun was one of the best parts of the meal and getting the all you can eat fries cooked in lard was good. Not much more beyond that  just scantily clad women serving burger  coke or PBR.', 'The burger was good  the fries were ok  but once you mentally process that they were deep fried in lard  then what was tasting really good turned into a really guilt-loaded dinner. But it is what it says it is. A truly American restaurant  proud of its decadence.', 'Yes  as someone stated before  this place makes hooters look like a classy restaurant. You walk in  and the nurse tells you to sit wherever you want at this enormous awkwardly shaped table (a cross). I\'m sure the owner or whoever designed it thought it was brilliant  but it was really awkward seating for our 6 person group. You sit on the outside of the cross  and the ""nurses"" work on the inside  taking orders/serving  etc. The inner lining of the cross also has mirrors  so you can check out your ugly nurses\' asses from a variety of unflattering angles. And you end up staring and being stared at by other patrons of the restaurant  since you have to sit facing them.\n\nThe food is really disappointing. Seriously  you expect the food at HAG to be like a ""guilty pleasure "" but for being that unhealthy  it has no flavor. Apparently  all they really intend is to clog your arteries  not to feed you something delicious. You can\'t justify putting that food in your mouth  because it tastes like soggy mush. Each patty is a half pound of unseasoned beef  cheese is optional. You have to go up and get your own tomatoes/onions/pickles (no lettuce)  and also your own fries (which they charge extra for  and only put out in small batches  so you have to wait in line to get them since they run out so quickly). The fries  yes you would expect them to be delicious for being fried in lard  but no  they are soggy and gross. It was basically eating some disgusting potato and ketchup casserole. Oh  and all beverages come in a bottle  including water  which is another way for this cheap restaurant to charge you. \n\nOur ""nurse"" (i.e. waitress) was also 40+ years old  and should not have been wearing that skimpy outfit  and the other nurse was too fat for her job. I guess they make the ugly nurses work during weekdays (jk..not really). The service was terrible too. Seriously  there was barely anyone there  and the nurses acted like they were busy doing something  and never tended to us or followed up with us. Like dumbas$es we still paid tip.\n\nAnyway  go to hooters if you want better tasting food  better service  and better looking waitresses. I\'m sure it\'s equally unhealthy  so don\'t feel bad. If you want burgers however  Red Robin has a tasty selection   and their fries are absolutely delicious (and they bring them to you  so you\'re not standing in line like an a$$). Come to think of it  I think HAG stole their menu from In-N-Out. The burgers are the same  just bigger and flavorless. At In N Out  you can order a hamburger  a cheeseburger  a double-double  and then the ""secret menu"" of increasing cheeseburger sizes  and  which is exactly what HAG does. \n\nBasically  the way HAG runs its restaurant is to cut corners. Make you serve yourself  while still bringing your food to you to collect tip. The huge table is easy to service  cuz hey  it\'s just one huge table. You\'re not really engaged in what is supposed to be an amazing and awesomely unhealthy experience to remember. Nothing is fun about being at HAG. They don\'t live up to the theme of the restaurant than say  5&Diner where you get the feel that you\'re in a 50s diner. Oh  and the music sucks.\n\nBottom line  go to this restaurant if you want to clog your arteries. That\'s all you\'ll get out of your experience. That and regret.', ""Great idea  but fail execution.\n\nWell... I don't know about great  but it is certainly an interesting idea. Almost clever. \n\nGoing here was my friend's idea - it was either this or get that gastronomical abomination from KFC where they give you a bacon and cheese sandwich and then replace the bread with deep fat fried chicken. I don't like KFC  so I went with this. My choices might as well have been a kick in the face or a stomp on the nuts.\n\nI didn't know what to expect. We walk past the ambulance into the restaurant. The air was thick inside. Oily. I quickly notice that everyone is wearing hospital gowns while devouring their meals. If peopleofwalmart.com was a movie - this would be the cast. \n\nWe found ourselves seats and were greeted by a sweet young girl who put a hospital wristband on us and then came around to put on our gowns. The place is staffed with cute girls in nurse costumes. I look down at the menu and the choices are called bypass - the severity varied by how many slabs of meat they put on. It was all kind of fun at first.\n\nI ordered the lightest thing on the menu - a single 1/2 pound burger - also an order of fries (which are unlimited refills) and a water... outside of water  my choices are sugar drinks or beer. My friend ordered a Double Bypass which was a pound of meat  also fries and also beer. \n\nThe fries were cooked in lard - they didn't taste too bad  but were not crispy or special at all. They just weren't worth getting up for seconds. Soggy  floppy and flavorless... just something to deliver salt to my stomach.\n\nThe burger arrived in a paper tray looking like a sad heap of grease. The bun was glistening - soaked with grease. Butter? Lard? Motor oil? I couldn't be sure  but the first bite told me I didn't want a second. I peeled the top bun from the burger and plopped it in the tray. I attempted to take another bite or two  but couldn't take it. The meat was sub-par shitty  fatty grocery store beef. The cheese was cheap tasting as well. \n\nNot that I expected wine and caviar  but for food this cheap and shit tasting  I wouldn't expect to pay so much. \n\nI didn't eat more than a few bites of the burger and I didn't touch the fries much  but I still felt both full and hungry at the same time. I pretty much just ate a few pickle slices and drank a bottle of water. The waitress asked how I liked it - my friend loved it and said he would've had seconds. I said it was terrible and that I was dissatisfied. I didn't ask for any money off the bill and she didn't offer it either. \n\nEven though I didn't eat it  she charged me 12 bucks or whatever it was. I wasn't entitled to not having to pay or anything - I mean  I ordered it. I should've known what I was getting into. Still  many restaurants would've bent over backwards to make me happy. I can't really bust them down a star for this  but even if I could there's no option for negative stars. \n\nHeart Attack Grill served me one of the worst burgers I've ever had. The novelty of it wore off as soon as my food arrived. If you want to eat an unhealthy yet savory burger/fries meal - go to in'n'out burger.\n\nI will never eat here again. I like greasy food sometimes  but I would rather eat a stick of butter and wash it down with bacon grease. Seriously - fuck this place. \n\nThen again... my friend loved it  so you never know."", ""If you aren't easy big greasy cheeseburgers  cold beer and hot waitresses who really turn on the charm then stay away from this place.  It isn't for those with weak stomaches and narrow minded chain driven people.  A little bit pricey but well worth it."", 'I saw this place on a show and me  and some friends decided to check it out. When we got there  we were blown away by how the place was set up. Was real creative. Our server took good care of us.\n\nOur food came pretty fast. It was neat to be able to build your own. \n\nHowever  half way through our meals  we had enough. The food was way to greased up. We all ended up getting sick after. I think it might be because we were not used to eating that much junk food in one sitting. It is worth checking out at least once  but be careful what you order.', ""The novelty of this place garners it some brownie points  and you definitely don't come here for the food. \n\nYes  scantily clad nurses will serve you your food  cheerfully chat you up  and be agreeable to a photo shoot at the end of your meal. You'll also appreciate the little things Heart Attack Grill does (i.e. conveniently placed mirrors at ass-level behind all the counters for any patron's ogling pleasure)  and there's no shortage of little quirks that definitely give the place character (i.e. their refusal to serve any diet sodas).\n\nThe food kinda sucks  though. I'll admit I liked the huge and considerately chilled Coke bottle  but that's about it. The fries were quite...flaccid and stale  the burger didn't seem so fresh or special  and it was relatively pricey for the amount of sustenance you get. Even so  you don't need more than a single bypass burger  unless you're itching to be useless for the next few hours  or if you are a gorilla. \n\nYet the clever presentation of what might sound like a practical joke with poor taste makes this place worth visiting with some friends. You'll have fun  and you'll be plenty full by the end of it!"", 'This place is literally a heart attack waiting to happen.  I was in Arizona visiting one of my best friends and he wanted to take me to Heart Attack Grill because he heard about it on Travel Channel\'s Best Places to Pig Out and had never gone.  As a consumer of large foods  I went for the quadruple bypass burger and it was indeed large.  They cook everything in lard  so it was extra greasy and had complete flavor.  I was actually very impressed with the taste.  My first bit was delicious...granted  there were many more bites after.  I loved it and was able to finish the monster of a burger.  I did add some pickles to the burger since I needed it to get through all four layers and 2lbs of burger.  The fries were pretty good too.\n\nMinus one star because the ""hot nurses"" were not that hot except for one (our server) who was kinda a B****.  She wasn\'t just that  but not even attentive when I needed an extra water.\n\nOh well...in the contest between Rube vs Heart Attack Grill\'s quadruple bypass burger...RUBE WINS!', 'Wow!  Are there no reviews of this place  yet?  Okay  this is a funky  fun concept for a restaurant.  First of all I need to let you all know the food is great  although one might not want to eat it every day.  The menu fits on one business card  so the choices are simple. Nothing is diet at all  and the french fires are fired in lard.  BUT  the food is soooo good.  The concept is cute too.  The cooks are dressed as doctors  and the waitresses are dressed as nurses a la Tim Curry as he was dressed in the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  It sounds weird  but I recommend everyone who loves a great burger try the Heart Attack Grill in Phoenix.  Get thee there!  Yum!', 'Yeah it kind of sux! Burgers aint that great (Though not terrible)  girls aint that hot (At all :( )  place aint very exciting (or clean).\n\nYeah it is kind of cool that they are dressed as nurses and you get a little hospital bracelet with their name and such. However  putting on mandatory hospital gown is odd and kind of off putting (To me anyhow). They also do have a bar and sell unfiltered stogies of some kind. \n\nThey also do not take CC!!! WTF I say! Is is a bit too much ""Old times charm"" for my taste. There is an ATM right in there so there is no real need to bring cash with you. \n\nI do not know  whole thing kind of odd. It would fit my better in like Greer or Page or something  rather then in Chandler.', ""If you're coming here  you know this stuff is absolutely horrible for you.

Couple that with hot girls running around in nurse outfits serving you up and you've got yourself a winner. The owner was awesome too  real laid back and chill guy. The fact you have to throw on a hospital gown and the overall atmosphere of the place is pretty amusing and cool. \n\nThis place is no gimmick  if you want a bomb burger and fries and don't mind tossing over a G of calories in your system  slide through!"", 'One of the WORST experiences of my life.  My friends and I decided to go and check this place out as the local radio kept talking about it.  So the day we decide to go  the guy from the Colbert report was there mocking the restaurant also.  We go in and we thought  ""hey wow  this is kinda cool"" as they talked about monster proportions of burgers and fries fried in lard.  However  once the food arrived we sat down and although the wait staff was scantily clad  all of them had ""cottage cheese"" legs and thighs.  We sat down  and my friend decides to take their super burger challenge  she said if he finished his 2 lbs burger  his meal would be on the house.  He kills it  and when we ask why his burger wasn\'t free  we could no longer find out waitress and the owner says to us ""you either pay or i come over the counter"" he threatened us with violence  which is stupid as all we were doing was asking what about what the waitress had told us.  We will never ever go there again.  Being Asian  he also spewed racial slurs at us  calling us to go back to where we came from.  ALL of us were born and raised in Arizona so I don\'t know where we would go.  Anyways  don\'t go here.  \n\nAlso  all of the patrons  ALL of them were middle aged men  who instead of paying attention to their wives and kids were hiding away at a nasty restaurant who\'s burgers aren\'t even really grilled.  the frozen patties from costco are placed on a machine that rolls the burgers through  so you can\'t even want a medium burger  they are all torched.  The fries although fried in lard  are crap.  All in all  if you\'re a lonely loser  this is the place for you.  If you\'re a classy kinda guy that wants REAL food  go to any other generic burger place and you will be more satisfied.', 'So fattening. SO unhealthy. SO DELICIOUS! It was worth the drive from LA to AZ.', ""Mmmmm now that's a tasty burger..... And of course the nurses were very nice too"", ""Ahhh the infamous Heart Attack Grill. \nListen  I am all for food that is bad for you. \nThere is a place in this world for it  and I will defend that place in the world as I would defend my own country from invasion. \nHowever  when food is not good for you  it better taste good. \nThis is the failure of the Heart Attack Grill. \n\n-When a burger is 8000 6000 4000  or 2000 calories  it better be in the top 10 of all time burgers. This is more like the bottom 10. \nThe burgers here are SOOOOOO GREASY. \nIf I went back I'd ask them for some burger with my grease. \nNow let me say  I'm not that guy who wipes off his greasy food with a napkin and THEN eats. When I seek out grease  bring it on. But the burger is so thoroughly and completely greased inside and out that there is no burger taste. Pure disappointment. \n-The fries  cooked in pure lard  were actually excellent. I almost gave this place 2 stars for that  but then I realized this is actually why I am giving it 1 star. \n-I do like the coke bottled in Mexico with actual sugar  not corn syrup or whatever the hell we use here. That was a plus. \n-I don't smoke  so I did not partake of the unfiltered lucky strike lung darts. \n-The wait staff. Wow  they aren't wearing much. We had a cute waitress  who would sit on the counter  and my sister realized that more of her butt was in contact with the counter than not. She was playing the role well. Flirty  dingy. There were some other waitresses that were probably 20 years her elder. I will not comment further for fear it may incriminate me. \n-The atmosphere.....White and Red  like In N Out or 5 Guys Burgers. Wheelchairs for people who eat triple or quadruple bypasses. What no Lipitor? I would bet money that the scary dude who sat next to us ogling the cute waitress for an hour was registered in the state as a sex offender  or at least on some FBI watch-list. \n\nI will leave you with the following thought as you ponder my lack of recommendation for The Heart Attack Grill. \nSomeone said this place makes Hooters look classy. ACTUALLY this place makes the Crazy Horse Too in Las Vegas look classy."", 'For those who have never been here  this place is basically a McDonalds with less service (since you garnish your own burger)  tiny menu and much more novelty.  Upon entering you are told to sit anywhere.  Most of the seating is bar style around the middle of the room.  The ""bar""/counter is in the shape of a hospital cross with conveniently placed ass-level mirrors all along the inside for the male patron\'s viewing pleasure.  You are given a hospital gown and a patient chart to fill in your order along with a hospital bracelet that says ""I Ate at Heart Attack Grill"". Their menu consists of the single (2000 calories)  double  triple  or quadruple bypass burgers (8000 calories)  flatliner fries  coke (with cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup in the old school cute glass bottle)  bottled water beer.  They even offer no filter cigarettes. The prices for the burgers range from $7.29 -$12.95.  I had a single bypass burger and flatliner fries.  The burger was okay and fries were thin and crispy the way I like them. The fries arrived first then when the burger arrives the nurse points you toward the toppings bar where you can add tomatoes  pickles  onion  jalapeños  ketchup and mustard to your burger.  The entire staff is female including the cooks who are also in nurse uniforms.  As expected  most of the customers were male.  The waitresses are very friendly and ours let us take a picture with her at the end of our meal.  Not a bad place for tourists to check out but if I ever returned to Arizona on a second trip I would skip this place.', 'Novelty - 8/10 - Go once to tell people you\'ve been there.  And duh your going to see sexy nurses and a unique restaurant concept that is telling you to eat so unhealthy it will kill you.  Its expensive for the food you receive but worth the novelty of it and the few pictures you leave with. \n\nFood - 3/10 - Take my word and other yelp comments the burger is nothing special.  The meat is very bland and has no memorable seasoning or sauce (yawn).  For a ""burger"" joint when calories are no concern you think it was the most amazing flavor ever.  It\'s not.  Burger Guru\'s go elsewhere.  The fries were a huge disappointment as well.  I went with 6 other people.  We all blamed the soggy fries on being the ""bottom"" of the pan.  We got more unlimited fries when a fresh batch came out and no one loved them at all.  Its funny cause there is a video playing on flat screens and when we saw the crispy looking fries on screen we were like \'we want those!\'.  The milkshakes were also disappointing because people expected more flavor like thick ice cream.  It was a very generic base that they just pump flavored syrup into  no blenders.  Also  people that dined the same day as us found a hair ball in the double burger.  It was pretty gross when he held it up and the nurses came running to replace!  I cant wait for his review!\n\nWho will go again?  0 out of 6 of us.\n\nWho is talking about this place to their friends and family? 6 out of 6 of us.\n\nWho felt a little sick to their stomachs? 4 out of 6 of us.\n\nOverall go once have fun.  But if you want a great tasting burger and some calories that may lead to an eventual heart attack find a gourmet burger spot with some crispy bacon  blue cheese crumbles  special sauce  and maybe even a fried egg on top.  A good burger is good til the last bite  this was not.', 'Hooters comes to mind when you think of a place like this. Yes. Hooters with hamburgers. Now that I think about it. Hooters and good food have nothing in common. Where as the Heart Attack Grill has pretty good burgers. \n\nBut you know you\'re walking into a situation where the servers are going to be running with the theme of a hospital and be dressed as nurses. Let me quote Animaniacs and say  ""Helloooooooooo Nurse!"" \n\nFrom the get go they tell you that eating here is not good for your health. It says it on the front of the door. It\'s like a cactus with spikes pointed out just telling you ""This will hurt if you touch it!"" But hell  who doesn\'t want a hamburger named after a medical procedure\n\nYou walk in and the place is set up like a huge bar made out of a giant red cross logo in the middle. Inside of which the dressed in nurse gear servers take your order while sports play on television. This place is delightfully tacky. \n\nburgers vary and a bypass is considered a half pound patty. So there\'s a single bypass  double bypass  triple bypass and quadruple bypass. You get the deal. They have fries that are cooked with lard. Sounds healthy  right?\n\nIt wasn\'t till about half way into the meal that I realized that the inner red cross symbol of a counter had mirrors that were angled up. This caught me off guard  like - wait  why am I looking up skirts while enjoying a burger? But sure enough they\'re there on purpose to give you a better view of the underwear of the waitresses. Oh man  that\'s when the misogyny was in full bloom  right? \n\nBefore feeling like a tool of the Patriarchy I looked over at the margarita bar and there was two couples that had to be in their 70\'s or early 80\'s. All of them eating the single bypass. And I really just thought to myself that this place couldn\'t be so bad if they are able to attract those elderly people here. \n\nEither that or I need to rethink what I know about the elderly. This may be a case of Benny Hill syndrome and I\'m just not hearing the Yakity Sax playing in the background.\n\nDuring the course of the meal they also had someone weigh in at the proper 350 pounds and surly enough  he got his food for free and the people in the place were screaming and egging him on. \n\nI would like to think that while they encourage you to let it all go. In fact making it so that if you suffer from Systemic and Diabetic II levels  you get your meal for free  that there\'s some sort of life lesson to be learned here.\n\nMaybe coming here and getting put center stage causes you to re-evaluate your weight problems. after your gluttonous burger and up-skirt adventure you\'ll change your ways.. \n\nSo how was the food? The burger was really juicy for being a massive pound and a half of meat between the burns. \n\nIt has a salad bar of condiments. So they pretty much give you the burger with bread and meat. You put the tomatoes and lettuce on it. I imagine they wouldn\'t want to encourage eating veggies. It would ruin their street cred. \n\nThey have real bottled sodas here  so that\'s a plus. Over all  if you can get past the whole idea that they\'re encouraging obesity (Well  not really - just being honest about their food) and move past the fact that you have short skirt wearing servers  then it\'s a stop worthy venture to come out to the Heart Attack Grill.', 'I took two vacation days off from work to visit Phoenix for the first time with a friend. Our primary objective for this trip was mostly to visit Heart Attack Grill. I became intrigued after hearing about it from various people and watched videos on Youtube about it.\n\nAnyway  the day after we arrived  we drove to Chandler to find the place. We entered the restaurant just a little after 11am  and were greeted by the waitresses. After sitting down  both of us ordered the Quadruple Bypass burger  which is 4 half-pound patties  4 slices of american-cheese with lard spread on the buns. In addition  we ordered the limitless fries (which are cooked in lard)  and 2 Mexican cokes (which are created using real cane sugar). We were also compelled to don ""medical gowns"" as part of our stay and given wristbands. It\'s pretty silly but the over-the-top-ness of it all was pretty cool.\n\nThe fries were great. Crispy and nicely salted  the prior knowledge of it being cooked in lard was not a deterrent; rather I was looking forward to food tasting better with more fat and grease involved. \n\nThe burger arrived not too long after finishing my first set of fries. It smelled great and glistened with grease  oil  and fat. I was disappointed that it did not come with any bacon. Maybe this is added by request but I did not see this option either on the menu or on the pictures of the burgers which adorn the walls.\n\nThe burger required a strategy in order to eat. There was simply no way to just pick it up and eat it as is. After picking up some additional ingredients (onions  ketchup  mustard  tomatoes)  and splitting the burger in half I began feasting away. The meat was delicious and cooked perfectly  and the melted cheese and added condiments/ingredients supplemented the flavor of the meat without being overwhelming. I did finish the burger eventually  but by the time I hit the halfway mark I was slowing down  visibly sweating from the grease  and everything started to taste like meat; even the Coke!\n\nI should note that by noon-time  the restaurant was packed full and there were people from all walks of life: the elderly  people in business casual attire  construction workers  etc. I also noticed that none of these people other than my friend and I had anything bigger than a single and the limitless fries.  This is probably the best way to go if you are regular here. I thought the burger was great but like everything else in life; overdoing a good thing only makes it bad. No points deducted for this at all because it was my first time in Phoenix and I probably won\'t be back for a while but the Quadruple Bypass was something to be tried.\n\nAfter finishing we paid our bill (Heart Attack Grill only accepts cash)  took pictures with our ""nurse"" and Dr. Jon (the owner)  and we were both wheeled out to our car in the lot.\n\nHeart Attack Grill is not meant to be taken seriously at all. In fact  they deliberately tell you that it\'s not good for you. In the end it\'s the consumer that makes their choice as they walk through that door to sit down for their meal. I thought the food was great for the price (so long as you don\'t do anything bigger than a double and hurt yourself)  and the staff was very friendly. This is worth a return visit the next time I\'m in town.', 'And now ladies and gentlemen... the single worst establishment I\'ve ever had the pleasure of eating at. Heart Attack Grill has ZERO redeeming qualities. There is not a single reason for me to even get close to giving this place anything more than one star. This is one place that makes me wish Yelp would allow a zero or negative star rating. \n\nNow  to preface this review... I\'m not an idiot... I know that this place is ""The Heart Attack Grill"" so I went in prepared for greasy and unhealthy food but hoped it\'d be fun and even though unhealthy  maybe taste alright. Whoa  was I ever wrong to hope for that. They group their burgers by how many patties there are... starting out with the Single Bypass burger (one pattie) and going up to the Quadruple Bypass burger (four patties). Being a little more on the conservative end  I went with the Single Bypass burger and a side order of fries. My Dad came along for the fun and he got the same... for the purposes of this review I should tell you that my Dad is a machine  he can eat... and he doesn\'t mind a little grease. \n\nRight as they bring our food out  I immediately get intimidated. The patty of the burger was dripping with fat and the meat used was such low quality (extremely high fat/meat ratio) that the patty didn\'t even appear to be beef... it had this whitish tint to it that you\'d have to see to believe. I\'ve never seen such an unhealthy piece of beef in my life... it doesn\'t help that they cook it in pure lard either. This was beyond unhealthy  it was disgusting. I feel like if you\'re making something blatantly unhealthy there should at least be a method to the madness; there should be some attempt at wanting to make it actually taste good (it is food by the way). It just seemed like they were pushing the grease and lard to the absolute maximum just to see how far they can take it. Well I\'m not impressed... I took one bite and was instantly grossed out  I actually almost threw up it was so bad. My Dad who can hang with the best of \'em was able to stomach about three bites until he could no longer continue. The second we left the place I turned to my Dad and said ""that\'s the worst single piece of food I\'ve ever put in my mouth"". I\'m not exaggerating when I say that I\'d rather eat a dried up piece of dog shit between two buns than a Heart Attack Grill burger. \n\nThe only thing worse than the food is the tacky and over the top waitresses. They wander around in little nurses outfits often times with their underwear quite visible  and their whole bar area has a slanted mirror to actually encourage you to look up their skirts. That\'d be fine and all  except I didn\'t want to look up these skirts. If you\'re going to have your wait staff dress sexy  you better make sure they\'re worth looking at in the first place. These girls were a little rough around the edges... most of them had that \'ex-stripper\' look; and I could have sworn that one of them had bullet wounds on her stomach... that\'s not a joke.\n\nP.S. I actually dry heaved while writing this review just thinking about my fat drenched burger. \n\nDO NOT GO HERE.', 'The burger was good not to mention the lard replaced the mayo.  I enjoyed the unlimited fries but wish they more side selections besides coke  water  beer  and unfiltered cigarettes!   Come on  some of us drove straight from OC to try it and would like a god damn Diet Coke!', ""I LOVE the concept.  It's close by.  The owner is a nice guy.  But there's a huge problem here  as others have opined - the burgers are HORRIBLE.  The bun is disgusting (if you can't even get the bun right  that's pretty sad) and the fried burger patty is bland  fatty  greasy  and not the least bit appetizing.  The fries are OK  helped taste-wise by the fact they're cooked in lard.  But they're nothing to write home about.  Everything else is all about the gimmick.. beer  booze  broads  cigarettes.  The burgers are EXPENSIVE.  Sorry  but I just can't come back.  If the burgers were even half-decent  I think this place would be a huge success.  But they're not  and I'd bet that repeat business is not nearly what it could be."", 'I\'ve been to this place several times in this and the last location they were in (which has since become its own T&A restaurant called ""The Grill Next Door"" if I remember right). \n\nOriginally I started coming for the novelty of it all  but now whenever I\'m in the Phoenix area I make a point of having at least a single-bypass before I leave town. \n\nThe burgers have been consistently good (eating one is like trying to tackle a huge meatball sub)  but since their most recent move the Flatliner fries have been drier and harder when my boyfriend and I get them. \n\nI totally dig that they serve the ""Hecho en Mexico"" Coke in the glass bottles. MUCH better formula (made with cane sugar as opposed to high fructose corn syrup).', 'I walked in with my sister and my boyfriend.  We wanted to see a menu before sitting down.  We were greeted by someone in a way-too-tight nurse\'s costume.  Every single man in the place turned around and stared at us.  Every man in there sat alone at the counter with a beer.  I wondered if we had accidentally walked into a strip club  based on the layout  the customers  and the wait staff.  The little nurse politely but loudly told us the menu was painted on the wall.  Heart attack burgers  ""flat line fries""  unfiltered lucky strikes and buckets of beer.  That\'s it.  So we turned around and politely walked out as fast as we could.', ""I took some out-of-towners here recently -- at their insistence. I was a little less enthralled the 2nd time around. The amusement of eating at a place called Heart Attack Grill that makes you wear a hospital gown and whose servers are dressed as nurses is only good for one visit. The next time  like me  you may only just shrug your shoulders.\n\nStill  it's not a bad burger. But  I wouldn't call it good either. But  it was deliciously gooey with cheese  and the flavor of the meat was decent. The fries are still pretty tasty  natural cut & fried in lard. Overall though...I can think of a lot of other places I'd rather have a burger.\n\nBottom line: Heart Attack Grill is a novelty. The actual food is just okay -- no need to dis it; we've all had worse and better. But  I'd rather have great food than a great gimmick."", 'Its no pretending here.  Its a bad for you burger.

I went there on my first visit to Arizona last year  and it pretty much was what I expected based off of tv specials and internet videos and interviews.  You get a decent burger at a decent price  and then you go up to the fry-bar and grab some fries and add some toppings to your burger.  \n\nThere\'s something rewarding about going into a place that says it will kill you  and walking out alive afterwards.  The experience comes complete with having to wear a hospital gown  and being waited on by ""nurses"".  The angled mirrors on the inside of the serving area are a nice touch ; )\n\nNow that I moved to Arizona  I\'m sure I\'ll be back each and every time a new friend or family member comes to town to visit me.', 'This place was GREAT! My boyfriend and I were ""admitted"" to the ""hospital""  with an IV bracelet and we were dressed in patient gowns for the duration of our meal. Our waitress was great and was very nice about taking our picture.\n\nThe food was great. My boyfriend loved his lard sauteed bun and the burger was tender and juicy. The fries were of course  fried in lard  and I went back for THIRDS because they are unlimited. We tried not to think about the calories and enjoyed our meal.\n\nI talked to the owner - the guy they interview on TV. He was a really nice guy  surprisingly. I asked him if he really was a nutritionist and he said ""Yes  and I still have a practice. I believe this is the best way to live. You have to have a cheat meal once a week. Don\'t eat here everyday  it\'s bad for you. But without a cheat meal  you\'ll drive yourself crazy."" I was a little star struck (I don\'t get out much) so I didn\'t ask anymore questions. I was happy that I got to meet him!\n\nThe reviews about ""cottage cheese thighs"" and this place being a Hooters knock off are  in my opinion  a little far fetched. I think if you\'ve seen the specials they have on TV about this place you pretty much know what you\'re in for. I thought it was great that the waitresses were dressed as nurses  and of course they aren\'t perfect. Perfect models don\'t have time to work in fast food! These are just real women making a living off their looks and having a good time. Besides  I\'m sure they make bank in tips from all the fatties that really do go there to gorge themselves on a daily basis (if you\'re over 350 pounds you can eat for free). \n\nAll in all  I was pleasantly surprised by the restaurant  happy that I got to talk to the owner/founder  and was treated well by the staff. The food was good  the atmosphere was fun. I recommend if you are vacationing in Arizona  check this place out!', 'Awsome food!\nIf you\'re looking for fancy  dainty  or any adjective other than basic - forget it.\n\nReal back to fundamentals food!\n\nBurger - beef  fried  nothing else.

Huge  GREASY  1/2 poind patties on large  GREASY  buns served with GREASY cheese. You won't find lettuce here  but you can add all the pickles  jalapenos  tomatoes and onions you want. \n\nFries? They were GREASY.... but fried in REAL GREASE. Fries cooked in hot lard. I don't know what trans-fat looks like but I'm sure these fries are the poster children for unhealthily cooked food.\n\nWe each had a Double Bypass and they were great. I'd recommend leaving off all the condiments and veggies so you can just savor this GREASE soaked piece of heaven. I could have gone for a Triple  but in retrospect  my heart is probably happy that I didn't. If you order the Quadruple  they wheel you out in a wheelchair. (seriously  they do)\n\nSugar laden Coca-Cola in large bottles  water and Margaritas are your choices for drinks.\n\nAll in all  this is a unique food joint that you have to experience at least once in your life.

Thirsty?  Lazy?  In need of sexy scenery?  \n\nWell  there's a one-stop shop for all your needs down in Chandler  AZ.  It's called  Heart Attack Grill and lemme tell ya  it lives up to it's name.  You can take care of your hunger with a double  triple  or quadruple bypass burger and an all-you-can-eat French fry bar  ease your thirst with an old-fashioned coca-cola straight outta the glass bottle (from Mexico even so it's real sugar)  and even get your lazy butt wheeled out to your car by sexy nurse waitresses after you've finished (if you order the giant burger)! \n\nWhat could go wrong you ask?  Well  very little  imo.  I went to Heart Attack grill fully expecting a greasy  over-the-top experience and I was not let down.  First impression  the bright red and white emergency motif  nurses in cute uniforms  good oldies kinda music and powerful smell of... lard? LoL  My friend and I both ordered the single bypass burger  cokes and he got the all-you-can-eat fries (no sharing allowed but that's ok because it's cheap - 1.85 per person).  Our burgers came out a little while later and lemme tell ya  even the buns were coated in grease.  I noticed not everyone had that slick shiney bun though so people in the know must order without the extra juice.  Really  I could've done without the extra slippery lard buns but other than that  it was a decent burger and a fun experience.\n\nThings I liked - the old videos playing on flat screens above me  the waitresses who bent over while talking to other customers so I could check out their bootays  the almost all female staff (only 1 male)  and the funny sad fact that anyone over 350lbs eats for free.  Gross.\n\nThings I didn't like - it was pretty messy... I guess cute cosplay waitresses don't really clean as well as regular waitresses do  the waitresses could've been more curvy (of course I like girls a lil think anyway)  the greasy buns that fall apart a lil while u try to eat em  AND... the funny sad fact that anyone over 350lbs eats for free.  Gross.\n\nIf I lived in Arizona  I'd probably go every once in a while  just for fun and of course  to entertain guests.  Not a good date spot. LoL  The manager guy was really nice though... he even played 'California Lovin' for me over the flat screens.  I told him if he opens a joint in Tokoyo  I'll go be 'head nurse' for him!  \n\nAnother cool thing  starting in October  they're going to have a live band on Saturday's from 2-7.   I guess some of the guys in the band have history with Alice Cooper and kinda with Metallica.  Neat.  I'll be back to AZ in November and I'll have to come by and check it out again.  \n\nSee ya there!"", ""I went because of the novelty and hype.  I've even had out-of-towners ask for this place specifically.  I found that people over 350 lbs. eat for free  and now I have a new goal.  The burger was OK  and the unlimited fries were a nice touch.  I can see why this place gets so much press.  Now for the big 3:\n\nService:  kind of sad.  The waitress seemed like she was put out to help us with our order  and she was often missing.  For example  I'd finished my soda  and waited over 5 mins. before she realized I was ready for more.  She never seemed happy to be there  regardless of the skimpy outfit she was dressed in.  Please don't expect playful or pleasing conversation from the wait staff.\n\nPrice:  It was 150% of what I expected.  A 1/2 lb. burger's avg. retail price is like  $5  and this is definitely more.  This alone will keep me from intentionally coming back  although  for the kitch of the place  I may bring out-of-towners.  It's definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  (double-down on the once part)\n\nTaste:  It's a good burger.  Nothing notable  exciting  or overwhelming.  It's what you'd expect from a flat grill.\n\nIn the end  this place lives up to the hype.  It's cool to go once to say that you've been there.  The prices are too high for this to be a place for a regular customer base  so take pleasure in visiting this during your one time.  If you're over 350 lbs.  then their pricing makes this the coolest place ever  for as long as your physicians will allow you to go.\n\nViva la Heart Attack Grill!"", 'My friend sent me a link about this place back in February and like most patrons  I thought it was a catchy yet ridiculous idea. Boastfully serving the ""unhealthiest"" food around? What an outrageous concept.  \n\nBUT BUT BUT but BUT \n\n""Outrageous""  in this case  is not used as a positive attributive. My bf and I came to Phoenix to visit some friends during spring break and decided to see what the hoopla was about. Heart Attack Grill is merely a novelty eatery  much like Hooters. The service was pretty average. Our server was nice but I noticed the others hardly smiled at or greeted their guests. The fries (fried in pure lard) were pretty dry for my liking. The ""single-bypass"" burger was very greasy and cheesy (the way I like them) but other than that  it was pretty bland. I did like their coke and it has been a while since I\'ve had coke out of an actual Coca-Cola bottle. \n\nThe place was pretty dead and I found it odd how there was no cash register.

So  of course  I had to go and see what the fuss was about. \n\nI walked in to the very small location  to find only 2 other tables with customers (older  unhygienic  obese men). The two waitresses on staff were less than appealing (and I\'m the kind of girl that can look at an attractive woman and admit it) and the ""cook"" behind the counter  in the scrubs/doctor uniform looked like his clothes and hair hadn\'t been washed in more than a week. \n\nWent ahead and ordered anyways. Their menu consists of 4 burgers (single  double  tripple  or quadruple bypass bugers)  flatliner fries  and soda... but no diet soda. Oh  you can also order a pack of Camel filterless cigarettes if your stash is running low. I ordered a single bypass burger  flatliner fries  and a coke. The burger was sub-par... very greasy and the fries were soggy and half cooked. The only positive thing I have to say is that I enjoyed drinking a Coke out of a cold glass bottle. \n\nI\'d rather go to Hooters to see hot  half-dressed chicks... and I\'d rather go ummmmm... ANYWHERE else to eat.', ""Not the best burger I've ever had  but a fun place to try with the coworkers on a Friday afternoon. I had the quadruple bypass and a few helpings from the all-you-can-eat fry station. Better than BK/McD's  but nothing to write home about. The waitresses were hot and they happily wheeled me out to my car in a wheelchair! But it's more of an attraction than anything else."", 'had heard about this place for several years  and it seems like not a week goes by that some reader doesn\'t suggest it to me. Motoring across the Southwest today  and finding myself on I-10 in Phoenix at lunchtime  it was the perfect opportunity for me to check out the Heart Attack Grill.\n\nThis place screams ""fun"" and ""man cave"" from the moment you walk in. One of the ""nurses"" approaches each patron at the door with the requisite hospital gown and wrist bracelet which ""must"" be worn in the ""operating room"". Your choice of seating include a counter  tables  or an outdoor patio.\n\nThe menu is placed in front of you  and the choices are few: a single  double  triple  or quad bypass burger; a buffet of fries (fried in pure lard  the sign says). The server was quick to point out they have no diet drinks or iced tea  just real coke (what  not Mexican coke?)  Jolt  or PBR. For real men  they sell Lucky Strikes and Camel Straights.\n\nI ordered the quad  for effect  they offer you a choice of cheeses  but otherwise  the decorating is up to you  at the ample fixins bar. (Which have some of the best dill chips I have ever had  anywhere).\n\nIt\'s help yourself to the lard fries  too (small extra charge)  which are dumped into a bin up front  hot  fresh  and very frequently.\n\nMy ""nurse"" Alicia  brought my quad out to the table  and stopped for a second for a photo op. Yes  there IS a burger in that photo  folks.\n\nShe said ""you are really going to enjoy eating this "" to which I could only reply  ""hell  I can\'t eat it  I\'m just going to admire it!""\n\nI went back to the fixins\' bar for more pickles to much on the side.\n\nI managed to work my way through one of the patties before tossing in the towel (gown?). The burger is full-flavored  and holds together well  indicating a pretty high fat content  which would be appropriate for the venue. It\'s like when people ask you if you like your chicken \'wet or dry."" If you like your burgers ""wet""  this is the place for you.\n\nThe service is over the top amazing  with the cheery girls  and knowledgeable kitchen staff that interacts with the patrons. This place has been around for several years  and I don\'t know why the landscape isn\'t dotted with them  certainly more ""fun""and unique that the any of the recent burger expansions  IMHO. Why hasn\'t Hooters bought this to prop up their ailing concept?\n\nIf you happen to be in Phoenix  or are just passing through  make the Heart Attack Grill an ""emergency stop.""', ""I was a bit creeped out the first time I ate here. I took my wife's younger brothers because they had seen it on the Travel Channel  so I thought I'd try it out. Being a large man  I got to eat for free (score!)  but only had one single and some fries  but enjoyed watching my teenage brother-in-laws try to finish their doubles (haha). I've been back several times with mixed experiences. It really depends on your nurse: sometimes you get a nurse who is very talkative and makes sure your order comes out real fast and hot  and sometimes you get a nurse who is watching the clock. It's not the best hamburger I've ever had  but I enjoy the do-it-yourself condiments (jalapeno and mustard for me)  and the fact that you know you are going to get CHEESE and BEEF  and in good portions. The fries are tasty  but inconsistent. Sometimes they're crispy and tasty  sometimes they're flat and soggy. I guess they could work on consistency."", 'This is by far the single worst restaurant experience of my entire life. I rarely ever write a review  but in this case  I wanted to make sure that anyone considering going to the disguising place is forewarned.\n\nFirst  the ""food"". I took my family here because i thought it would be a fun  novelty experience. It was definitely different. Could have been cool  but instead  the place is a complete dump. The ""food"" was utterly disgusting. With burgers being the only thing on the menu  i would think that they could figure out how to make a good burger. Nope. Just a nasty grilled piece of the lowest quality beef they could find. Yuk.\n\nSecond  we had the displeasure of meeting the owner. He came across as a total sleeze ball which wasn\'t much of a surprise given the quality of his restaurant.\n\nEating here is probalby pretty close to what it must feel like to eat in a scummy strip joint. Do yourself a favor. Go anywhere else but here.', ""' So how many pounds do you think I'll gain from one of their burgers? oohh... and with their lard fries?? ..I guess I'll take the chance!'\n\nThese are the words that I said to pump myself up for what I thought would be a burger worth the weight gain..\nThat didn't quite happen  not because I have a good metabolism but because they had NO BEEF!\nThis was on a Saturday afternoon.. \nThis was strike one.\n\nStrike two:\nWent back  pumped myself up again  had the burger and was completely disappointed.\nThe atmosphere was lacking  the fries were not memorable and the beef was just off in flavor.\n\nAll this unhappiness and I am still trying to work out the extra pounds.\n\n2 stars for effort.""]"

I have not had a bar offer this much comp for new players that I can remember. So it was definitely worth playing some to get that $50 in free play.

No combo this time.  3 of 5 times  including today  I've gotten sausage instead of bacon.  It's annoying this time because they even asked me at the pay window to confirm bacon.

The same people have been working here for a long time  and they may have gutted the exterior and interior  but until they gut some of the employees out this location simply will not change.  I would suggest a change in upper management of this location - Staff reflects leadership  and the leadership is poor.\n\nAs far as people saying they've gotten sick from the food - I haven't gotten sick personally  but my job is very close to this location.  I've seen co-workers get sick from eating there.  But you have to have a bit of a iron-gut for Wendys.

I rarely am unable to finish my onion rings and Barbie\'s can be among the proud members of that prestige club. The onion rings were clearly coming directly from a prepared bag. Some of them were still COLD inside and weren\'t heated properly  The breading was uninspiring.\n\nThe Burger meat pattie was bland with no spicing and absolutely no salt. The cheese in the burger wasn\'t melted and the onions weren\'t caramelized. Frankly  it was a sad burger! Amateur hour.\n\nFound a random chicken nugget within my onion rings (don\'t ask how it got there). Ate it for the hell of it.

However  our server was excellent  he was friendly  attentive and quick which was great ! Foodwise though   while it wasn't horrible by any means  it was very ordinary (Although the portion size does help to justify pricing). We started with their tropical sangria pitcher (28$) but it was quite big and came with a complimentary order of Nachos (nachos were just so-so but they were free so cant complain too much) and the sangria was pretty good.  I had their lasagna which was HUGE and wasn't horrible but there was barely any meat in it and the pasta was a little overdone for my liking   but their sauce and cheese was tasty. I tasted their Fish and Chips as well (The portion was large but the fries were a little soggy and the fish batter was a too oily).

I never had the opp to try a slice because I had only eaten breakfast here  but I sure was tempted.\n\nUnfortunately  when I stopped by on my most recent excursion I noticed the location had been boarded up.

The amount of food on the plate is almost to the point of being unappetizing  so you have to order just one plate and share.  \n\nThat being said  the matzoh ball soup would have been enough for the two of us  but we went ahead and ordered the whitefish ""appetizer "" which could have fed four people easy.  The soup was kinda bland  but the matzohs were cooked perfectly.  The whitefish was super yummy  if a bit bony  and served with bagel  cream cheese and the standard tomatoes and cucumbers.  The chocolate egg cream was delish.\n\nWe felt guilty for not finishing the whitefish.  I wonder how much food this restaurant wastes?

We were like pissed that everything was a rip off.  I know that seems weird because of course it's that way- it's Vegas  losers.  But we couldn't get past it.\n\nThat said  we were happy when we found NY Stage!  After eating unhealthy choices like Sbarro's for a couple days  it was nice to eat a yummy veggie wrap in a spinach tortilla.  My stomach was so grateful.  My husband ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and said the meatballs tasted homemade.

My sister and her boyfriend insisted on going to Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill for lunch. Not having $30 to drop on a sandwich  my friend and i chose to browse the forum shops for something cheaper. We randomly came across Stage Deli and since neith of us knew exactly what we wanted  we stopped to choose from their large menu. I settled on a chili dog which was delicious! I had to ask for a side of onions and a side of cheese to complete the chili dog  but once it was all together  it was good!  The chili dog  itself was huge and so was the bun (what a concept). The chili and the fries were all delicious. My friend got a meatball sub which she seemed to enjoy and thank GOD they never put a bucket of pickles on our table.

The burgers are tasty  and seem to be very fresh. No rubber patties! The price of the burger is priced proportionately to how many toppings you like (which seams fair to me)  but many toppings are free too. While it is a bit pricey for takeout ($25+ for 2 burgers  2 fries  and two drink)  I think I would still choose this over most of the alternatives. The fries are good  the onion rings are great  the milk shakes are tasty. Overall win for the neighbourhood. \n\nAlso - bonus points for being very clean  which is high up on the importance scale for me. \n\nI actually watched the manager sign out after her shift  but on her way out  which I imagine was unpaid time  she went around and tidied up some tables  pushed in chairs  etc. A manager who cares! How novel!"", 'Good food.  Lots of burger options that do not disappoint.  Too bad the service was slow.  The Kipling site is now short.\nThere are other locations around town.', 'Love this place.

My toddler son loves it here too!', ""Overpriced so-so burgers  no gourmet in sight...\nWe ordered the double cheeseburgers with rings. The rings were bland and looked like they had been in the fryer for an hour.\nThe patties were obviously pre-cooked and quite bland. Buns here are normal Kaisers  which is a good choice  but with bill of $18 I expect something..... GOURMET! Say a Brioche or at least an Ace Bakery bun?\n\nService and topping choices were plentiful  but toppings are rationed so much I could barely count the toppings I had ordered  a sliver of Jalepeno  a teaspoon of caramelized onions  again for $18 where is the love.\n\nYou can find a better burger at many restaurants in the area for $12 add a beer and you're much more satisfied for you $18. Will not be back  if you're stuck in the area  there are much better choices around under a kilometer away."", 'Would give it a 3.5 if I could. They have some interesting burger choices  lamb meat etc. The topping and sauces were great but the paties were a little small and overcooked for my taste  although I guess all ground meat has to be well done in Ontario. Sweet potato fries were pretty good. Nice helpful staff. Very affordable', 'What happened? Your burgers use to be the best around. We tried your new Angus Beef burgers which were dry  overcooked and tasteless. It was like you squeezed all the juice and flavour out of the burgers. Fries were overcooked and dry as well. I know good fries are double-fried but these were more than triple-fried. Your service is always friendly but food very disappointing this time.', 'It\'s like a fancy semi self-serve Harvey\'s. You place your order at the front  pick up your drink from the fridge on the side and wait at your table until they call your order. We had the signature combos: \n\n- SMOKEY BACON BURGER + ONION RINGS + JONES ROOTBEER\n\n- SPICY CANJUN BURGER + REGULAR FRIES + H2O\n\nBoth burgers were great  the beef patties were super juicy and tasted like real beef...not like the standard ""burger flavour"" you get at fast food chains. The onion rings were pretty awesome as well  my friend kept eating mine. It\'s probably because the regular fries SUCKED. There is nothing special about the regular fries  they are cut short with the skin on and have no particular deliciousness. \n\nThis location is clean and because it\'s on the Kipling strip it\'s relatively quiet. When I was there on a Sunday  the other patrons were families with small (and well-behaved!) children. I\'m not sure how this place is on a weekday.', 'Mediocre at best.

You order your choice of meat first then move to the end of the counter to customize your pita while they cook the meat on a grill in front of you. I saw the comparison to Subway in other reviews and in my opinion the only comparison is perhaps the business model (the concept of customizing your food). The quality however is not comparable.

Probably wouldn't go back without some kind of discount or coupon.  7.50 for a gyro and only 4 little mystery meat slices."", ""So I had Pita Pit tonight for dinner and it was so-so. Its definitely a subway-esque fast food joint.  I got the chicken souvlaki and was really disappointed by the quality of the chicken  it very spongy and some pieces seemed discolored.

If for some reason I find myself back at Pita Pit I'd definitely go the veggie route."", 'Great stop for hungry bellies. Rarely come to Henderson but I am glad I spotted Pita Pit.

If they had one in Summerlin that would be amazing. \nLove the music and friendly faces.', 'Not bad at all. I may have to work this place in to my regular rotation.\nAs other reviewers have mentioned  this place is like Subway/Qdoba.\nYou pick your base protein  and everything else is pretty much customizable. You choose between white or wheat pitas  and you have a wide choice of add-ons  even some Mediterranean stuff such as hummus . Avocado spread does not carry an extra charge. And there are a wide range of sauces.\nBeing a ""healthy"" joint  they also carry a lot of smoothies. I question how healthy smoothies really are  but that\'s another debate. Smoothies are the expensive items on their menu.\nToday was my most recent visit. I had the Chicken Souvlaki with a Mango Tango smoothie. The price point for the pita seems to be slightly less than most of Subway\'s footlong sandwiches  which is awesome since I think the food is much better than Subway anyways. And with the Yelp check-in 10% off coupon  this was a great deal. I spent just under $11 before tip.\nAs far as how healthy this place is  well  that\'s entirely dependent on your self-control. If you eat your pita straight as it is  then yes  it\'s healthy. But if you have to have potato chips and cookies  and you have to drench your pita with dressing and sauce  then you\'ve just defeated the purpose of eating healthy. That being said  even if your goal isn\'t to eat healthily  this place is still a tasty option to change things up once in a while.', ""There are so many choices of where to eat when you live in Las Vegas. One day my friend and I were cruising around tryna find something new. Stopped in at Pita Pit  the first thing I noticed was how clean it was which is always a huge thing for me.

I always get the chicken Ceaser on a wheat pita. Food is always on point !', 'Food was okay. Two of us ordered a chicken Caesar pita and thought they were small for the $. Ordered on line  but wish we had waited because the menu was more extensive than their web site showed.', ""Quick and easy. Pros are the many custom pita choices  fast service  and friendly staff. Cons are what you expect with fast food  the pitas aren't even fresh (look like an average bag from your local food mart) and the meat is over seasoned yet somehow underwhelming in flavor  especially the traditional gyro meat. Stick to stuffing a pita and avoid other menu options for the best value."", 'The hours say they\'re open until 10pm. The sign on the door says they\'re open until 10pm  yet when I showed up at 9:45 the doors were locked and the ""open"" sign was off.

I\'m not opening the doors for you."" Extremely disappointed  since this WAS one of my favorite places by my office for lunch.', ""This place is great with good prices to boot.  Went in for a pick up of lamb wrap  garlic feta fries and grape leaves and everything was amazing.  Everything was hot  freshly prepaid and super tasty.

The few that existed in California have closed since 2005. So I was very excited to see that one existed in Vegas. \n\nI got my usual grilled chicken pita.  The order taker told the sandwich maker to throw a chicken  and instead of doing it then going back to reorganizing the station (which makes sense cause it takes some time for the chicken to heat) she finished what she was doing first. I then  asked her to change her gloves because I'm very sensitive to onions and peppers which she had been handling. She did it but wasn't very happy about it. \n\nI guess the new thing they do is steam the pita. She did it before I could stop her. I asked her to use a new unsteamed pita which totally annoyed her. Then we had to wait longer for the chicken to finish. The iceberg lettuce was kind of bitter because it was mostly yellow. Also I'm not liking the slices of cheese. What happened to shredded cheese? Anyways the experience sucked and my pita wasn't very good. I only ate half of it and threw the rest away. I guess I will have to live off my memories."", ""So good.!\nIve been here 4 or 5 times already and I order the same thing each time. The falafel pita. It was so good. The price is excellent for the quality and size of what you get. Make sure you get a card so you can get points and then get a free pita!\nThey load you up with a ton of ingredients  all your choice. Did you know pineapple goes with falafel? Well  it does! I was really crazy about the humus or tsiziki sauce  but with all the other stuff  who cares!\nService is always friendly and quick. I love that no matter how many people are in line in front of me  I'm always eating in less than 5 minutes. A freshly made  delicious pita stuffed with all my favorite ingredients...thank you pita pit!"", ""I had the chicken breast pita   while I enjoyed the choice of fixings   they were skimpy with the chicken.  The veggies were fresh   the chicken was good   just not enough of it.  Wasn't fond of the pita bread either"", ""We are from Israel  and I have an obsession with my falafel and hummus. Well I went here and after seeing the menu  realized it's more of a wrap/sandwich style place and not a Mediterranean establishment. \nUpon seeing that  as normal I began to walk out  when the man working nicely offered a sample and reassured me to give them a try because it was tasty. Well I must say  to that guy; you saved my opinion of the place! I ended up ordering and taking it togo.. \nI must say  good falafel; but extraordinary staff!!"", 'Excellent food excellent service excellent prices! I would eat the chicken Caesar pita every day if I could!', 'Pita Pit is my FAVORITE restaurant! If you\'ve never eaten here you HAVE TO try it! I love everything about this place. The vegetables are extremely high quality and fresh. There is no wait and they grill the chicken or steak right in front of you. Ask for it ""Loaded"" meaning onions  mushrooms  and peppers right on the grill. They also have pineapple  artichoke  black beans  and even roasted tomatoes. You can\'t compare it to any other fast food restaurant because it\'s very healthy with giant servings. $7.25 is the total after tax. It\'s cheap! They also have real fruit smoothies for $4. So worth it! Great date place.', ""It's like a Subway  but just with cooked meats and Mediterranean flavors.\n\nI tried their gyro meat  which is 3 evenly cut strips of of gyro meat on the grill.  The fun part is when I get to add a variety of ingredients in my wrap.  There's hummus spread  garlic spread  olives  different types of lettuce  artichoke hearts and the usual cucumber and tomato  some peppers and a few more options.  \n\nThe pita is stuffed with all the goodies  then they roll it all up for a easy to eat wrap.  If you come on Wednesday  it appears they have double meat for only $.99 versus the norm $2.

The Pita Pit won't charge you for the wrong pronunciation. (Says it on the tip jar..) Anywho  the Gyro is very tasty. Didn't feel like eating anything heavy for dinner so I opted for the gyro. Fresh ingredients  with a choice of white or wheat pita. Great service and great location...Can't go wrong with the Pita Pit... A much more healthier option."", ""I had my first experience with Pita  Pit in Valencia CA and I was so excited to see that we had one in Vegas.  The staff at the Silverado Ranch shop are very friendly and the pitas are just so fresh and delicious!  The set up is similar to Subway but the main difference is that you get a hot pita with so much more meat.  In addition to Subway's selection of veggies  they also have artichoke hearts  corn  a bigger selection of cheese and 2 different types of lettuce to choose from (I love romaine) and much much more.  Great selection of sauces too. Yummy!"", ""I LOVE this place! Pita Pit is my Go-To lunch stop cuz it's fast and easy and soooooo delicious! They have healthy options and it's very filling!

Staff was friendly and patient while we looked over the menu. I chose the chicken souvlaki pita. It was nice they offered avocado without an additional charge. The chicken was very bland however  even with avocado and tzaziki sauce. \n\nThe pita looks more like a burrito since they fold it over and roll it up. A pita to me is always served open at the top and more sturdy. With so many Mediterranean and sandwich places in town I wasn't too impressed."", ""I just tried this place on saturday. I already returned back on monday. Lol. This place has really good soft pitas that are steamed to perfection.  The toppings are fresh. The chicken meat was awesome. Did I mention....There guacamole is the bomb. Plus add artichoke! ! Needless to say. Don't forget your rewards card. I went only twice. Next time I go I get a free pita!! fist bump!!

The pitas tastes good  but my friend and I wanted to order in  and it was a long  confusing process!!  I'd rate them higher if it wasn't for the fact that ordering online was a huge issue.  Originally  my friend and I called the restaurant to place an order  and they answered and said that we had to do it online so we hung up went to the website and tried to find where to place an order but could not find it on the website. Turns out they had multiple different website so it was hard to know which one to place an order on. Finally my friend and I found the one where you could place an order and when we tried to place an order  we kept getting bounced back.  We tried to place an order for probably at least 20 minutes! Out of frustration we called the restaurant and spoke with someone and they ended up having to just take our order over the phone. So basically we wasted 20 minutes when we could've placed it over the phone in the first place! After we ordered the food it didn't take them too long to deliver it  probably about 20 minutes. The food was pretty good and the pitas were pretty good-sized! I say your best bet is to just go into the restaurant instead of trying to order on their website."", 'Simple easy place to get quick grub. \n\nCame here one afternoon after a workout sesh across the street  and just wanted something quick and healthy. Thanks to the Yelp app  we got 10% off our order. Always nice to get a discount. The pita came out pretty quick  we also added some grilled onions and bell peppers for flavor. The hummus was consistent and flavorful. \n\nService was nice  efficient  and quick.

Went there today and they are permanently closed.  Just a sign on the door.  I had a free sandwich to redeem.  I'll have to call corporate.  Too bad since we really liked their food.  Have to see about other locations.  They won't be close though.  Shame."", ""I think I may like Pita Pit a little too much!\n\nQuick tip: Monday through Friday between 5 Pm to 7 PM  it's happy hour which is buy 3 pitas  get 1 free. And also  DOUBLE MEAT FOR 99 cents. \n\nIt's honestly my go to place for quick  yet relatively healthy food. One of the beauties of this place is that you can choose what vegetables you want and the save you want. \n\nI normally get the Philly on wheat pita with the peppers  mushrooms and onions grilled with it. This may sound odd  but I usually get teriyaki sauce on my Philly and it's amazing. Again  it's part of the beauty where you can try different flavors out.""]"

Under the name of Mr. G's  it's the cleanest and most pleasant smelling I have ever experienced.  There was no smokey smell.  There was also no stall smell of a spilt beer or any other alcoholic beverage for that matter.  This includes the bathroom of which I also found unusually clean for such an establishment.\n\nRon was on point with coffee and beer.  We were carb loading after all. I thought the beer selection was slightly limited for my wanna-be liquid bread palate.  Ron was full of stories about the pub and tales of old Vegas.\n\nReggie our cook tucked away in the back somewhere was as affable as Ron.

Bullshit! She then supposedly had the manager's wife hand my fiance his soda  and that was bull  because she was getting sloshed at the bar with the other customers   some manager's wife. The later we were told that there was no water in the restrooms ( major health code violation) which nothing was posted about  and then my sister was told that she had to have a certain drink limit before they could charge her card  and nowhere was this posted  so yet another violation. The only pleasant experience was our server and the food  which both were great  but the so call bar and bartender on Monday-Wednesday nights needs a overhaul.

There were only a couple to chose from when I arrived. The beer is cold and atmosphere positive.\n\nThere are comfortable bar stools and booths if you so desire. The 70's decor bleeds through the modern decoration. Several flat screen tv's are positioned so that wherever you sit you can watch what interests you. There are two Diamond pool tables positioned with plenty of room to operate and not far from the bar which keeps it intimate. \n\nThe attentive bartenders keep the libations fresh and full as time is quickly consumed by great conversation of various bar topics.

I do not smoke and would find it more pleasurable if there was one more to consume the perpetual cloud of smoke. Nonetheless the ventilation provides tolerable air quality. \n\nOverall this bar is an unexpected gem and pleasant surprise in this area.

I went when they first opened and had a pretty good experience  but I just hadn't gotten around to returning until today. I had one of the specials 2 slices and a 20 oz drink. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the pizza really was New York Style. One of my slices was a veggie slice and the other was a cheese slice with sausage. Both slices tasted fresh and good. I'm sorry I didn't return sooner because I liked the pizza here much better than the pizza at Fuel. There are absolutely no frills here. It's a very small place and everything is either to go or to be eaten on a bench outside. But if you want a quick lunch at a reasonable price  stop by and enjoy."", ""So today I went back and ordered a NY cheese slice and Buffalo Chicken slice...\n\nAfter waiting about 10 minutes for two slices  I was thoroughly disappointed.\n\nThese are not NY style slices in taste OR size (I am from NY and am well versed in the ways of quality pizza. I also worked in a pizza shop in NY).\n\nThe cheese slice was dreadful. The quality of cheese they use is just terrible and evident after the first bite. This tastes like something an amateur made in their own kitchen.\n\nThe buffalo chicken was slightly better  but nothing to shout home about.\n\nBoth slices rang up to $5.41  which seemed acceptable until I witnessed the size and tasted the slices. Additionally the crust was terrible.\n\nDo yourself a favor and look elsewhere.\nThis place is overpriced and I can't even call it mediocre."", 'Just picked up our $21 pizza.  Pepperoni and mushrooms.  Well  mushroom pieces  around a dozen small pieces. You had to look hard to see them.  Flavorless crust.  Whole pizza very close to tasteless.', 'OMG the this place is a hidden gem in Davidson that i wish i had found sooner. We were recommended this place by a couple who had come out of their massage right before we went in for ours. Decided to stop in after and get some food we basically took the grand tour of the menu by ordering wings  Pizza  garlic knots  chicken parm stromboli and a salad. Everything was on point from the wings to the garlic knots to the pizza. The key is always get extra cheese. I will definitely be back and will recommend it to my friends as well.', ""We picked up some wings tonight  buffalo and plain. Both of them are not good at all  very dry and a lot of little chicken feather. The buffalo ones have black pepper and salt  and subtle vinegar taste. We didn't finish them. I don't think we will go back."", ""Davidson Pizza is delicious!  I hate chain pizza.  Loathe it.  Avoid it at all costs.  Will go hungry before eating it.  Which means I like to try all the local pizza places to find my favs.  Davidson Pizza makes the cut with it's delicious NY style pizzas and friendly service.  It's located in the smallest little brick building you can imagine  next to the Ada Jenkins center.  No inside seating but there are three picnic tables outside.  They actually have a lunch special with salad and a slice  so don't discount them when you're looking for lunch ideas.  It seems to be family run as the sweetest little 10 year old rang me up last visit.  \n\nI like the pizza  I like the service  I like how close it is to Davidson College.  My only meh feeling is over prices.  You can sign up for email coupons but I've never gotten one in two years.  The pizza isn't inexpensive  it's $14 for a large and $2.50 per topping.  I'm well aware that pizza is the biggest markup on the planet... a pizza's basic ingredients cost about $1 per pie.  I like mushrooms on pizza and one white mushroom sure doesn't cost $2.50 to buy.  Since I buy 2-3 large pizzas per visit a quantity discount would be appreciated.  But other than pricing  I really  really like this place."", ""Ok- so  I am updating to give Davidson Pizza Company a 5 star rating.  I splurged a bit this past few months  and ate their gluten FULL pizza  and garlic knots.. wow!\nI haven't had pizza with bubbles in the crust since I left NY ( only someone from the north would know what I mean perhaps...) This pizza is so delicious  I would highly recommend this pizza for anyone looking for quality! (Additionally  they own Hawthornes  so this now makes sense!!)"", ""I cannot yet comment on the quality of the food. I walked in (first time) at 3pm and inquired about slices. I was told they were out of slices. Incredibly disappointing. Honestly  it takes less than 10 minutes to make a pizza for additional slices. Seems lazy to me. Poor customer service. On a side note  I think that there pizza is incredibly overpriced  and the parking situation a bit shady. Will update when I finally get to try a slice or two. As a former New Yorker  I'm always suspicious of pizza claiming to be NY style."", ""I've been here twice now. The folks working here were great  everyone was extremely busy yet still able to have a great attitude. I've only had their pizza so I can't speak about anything else. To me their pizza had great potential but what dragged it down was their exceptionally DRY crust  both times..same cardboard like crust. I think if they play around with their dough  oven temps or cooking times they could have a 5 star pie."", ""My review is based off of the incredible experience we had at the Mooresville location (same owner for the food)  Ghostface Brewery and Pizza.  The pizza is one of a kind craft pizza  and absolutely delicious.  We've had 3 different pizza so far  and it's always a hard decision on which one to try next.  Met the owner and his family too...great people who really care about making you happy.  For anybody in the Davidson area  this place is just a few streets off Main Street  and worth the short detour!"", 'Small location  but great service. Garlic bread could have used more garlic.

The ONLY reason they get 2 instead of 1star is my husband actually loved the garlic knots (I thought they were too tough & chewy  but to each his own  so they get a full star for that) I wound up warming up leftover lasagna at home because I just couldn\'t stomach a second slice.

The toppings offered are standard fair (ie. onions  pickles  lettuce  tomato  peppers).\n\nWhat I really enjoy are their fresh cut fries.  They are so good.  Nice thick cuts with the skin on.  Always crispy.\n\nThe other side I really enjoy are the onion rings.  It's got the right amount of batter  not too thick and heavy.  The only thing is the batter absorbs a lot of the oil which is typical of onion rings.\n\nI did order the souvlaki chicken once (take out) for the kids and it'll be the last.

I was a bit surprised by the portion size of my salad  it seemed a little small when I opened the container but there was more than enough salad inside. Mine came with onions  olives  tomatoes  cucumbers (I think...)  the obligatory lettuce that makes the salad  feta cheese and chicken. They asked me if I wanted tzaziki and I suppose it's just meant for the chicken for dipping because there was no pita or anything included. All in  great flavor and super tender chicken. The dressing was tasty  everything was fresh and before I knew it  it was all gone! The only thing missing for me was tasty pita to go along side my healthy dinner!\n\nI'll definitely come back here again  the fries here are quite good  but the salad was definitely a winner for me in an area where you can't really get many salads as takeout without worrying about what's in them."", ""I was served by 3 big guys when I went to Big Boy's Burgers for my burger fix.

A chocolate croissant and a baguette.  The croissant didn't make it home and there are little flakes of it in my car.  (I never eat in my car!)  I mentioned the time of day because every time I had a croissant in France  it was in the morning.  It was a tiny bit less melt in your mouth than in France  but I'll bet that's only because it wasn't fresh out of the oven and still warm like the first batch of the day.

Now the sandwich was great  the bread was especially delicious  but I think the almond croissant (~$4) was the star of my meal. It's probably one of the best almond croissants I've ever had and I order those wherever I can find them. They make their own almond paste  import their butter from France  and get their flour from Europe. They make a point to bake their goods from scratch and the quality is obvious from how it tastes. Definitely going to order more of these in the future and maybe also try the almond chocolate croissant that they offer.

Now  the third/current owners (the two sisters mentioned above) are looking to put their own spin on the place while keeping a lot of the traditional French offerings without sacrificing quality. All in all  I'm glad Bonjour is back. It's a great place to grab a coffee and a meal/pastry. They're making some new breads too  some of which are very brioche-like. I'll definitely be back in the future to try out some of their new creations."", ""The new owners have ruined the baked goods.

The iced tea and dessert were delicious. I can't wait to try more of their items!"", ""If you want the closest thing to authentic French pastries and light fare  it doesn't get better than Bonjour Bakery. The Chef/Owner is one of the best French chefs in Vegas. He is sticking to his guns on authenticity of his menu as opposed to adapting for American preferences. Try the baguette sandwiches  they are to die for."", ""I have been passing by this place every time I go to Sprouts  and today I decided was the day I would go in! I was greeted by a beautiful  vibrant woman named Elisa who greeted me in French (as she thought I was French) very sweet. She offered me some of the cakes they had as samples on the counter  I can't remember what they were...but oh they were so delightful!\nI ordered a ham and cheese croissant that came with a salad; I asked for the pomegranate vinaigrette. I must say...WOW! I literally giggled after taking my first bite of the croissant! So perfectly crafted!\nThe vinaigrette was the perfect balance of bitter and sweet.  I ate practically ever crumb on my plate!\nIt was such a beautiful day  the sun shining into the shop put an extra layer of dazzle of the day.

The menu features French and Korean choices which I was surprised to see based on the name of the cafe. I ordered a ham/cheese croissant and hubby ordered the Croque Madam. Each entree came with a side of delicious organic greens and veggies. They were just delicious and so fresh. My croissant was tasty but hubby's sandwich was just ok. We then enjoyed some conversation with another one of the gals working there. The surroundings are a couple tables for two and a four top. The cafe features various local artists works\nand many are for purchase. \n\nIn addition  I purchased a couple of chocolate croissants and a baguette. All of my purchases were delicious.\n\nOverall we enjoyed our experience and although it was not the best French lunch we ever had  the warmth and friendliness of the owner and staff makes me want to come back."", ""I am so glad this is under new ownership! This bakery is in the same shopping center as Sprouts and CVS on Flamingo and Rainbow. It's a Korean Swedish fusion with a French ambience! Super cute little bakery with great food and pastries! I came in on a Tuesday afternoon with my boyfriend before we went to buy groceries! Pro tip - always eats before buying groceries so you don't buy everything! It's right next to Myloan nails. When you walk in you see the menu on a big chalkboard behind the register. Everything is organic and made by the owner! She was so sweet! The music was French and soft it made you feel like you weren't in a shopping center but rather a cafe in Paris! It was a little bit later in the afternoon so we decided on lunch. The menu had croissants sandwiches and bulgogi burgers and noodles! We ordered the burger and the noodles! They were both a 10! The owner makes this dressing that's sweet and spicy and you pour it over the noodles or salad it was so good. You can also buy jars of this sauce  I recommend getting some for salads at home! The flavors of everything stood out it was delicious! Definitely will be  returning to eat here and try everything!"", 'Lovely new owners. JUST reopened.  Still a quaint high quality French bakery and cafe and so much better than the previous owners who let it go. I love stopping by in the afternoon for a coffee and pastry. The coffee is a an amazing European brand.  Excellent customer service and very attentive.  They are adding new items everyday it seems.', ""Tough location for Bonjour in a grocery shopping center off Rainbow and Flamingo. But if you don't miss it  you'll find a solid local sandwich stop. Super friendly service with opportunity to sample some free pastries. For under $10 you can get multiple sandwiches which come with a very fresh salad with collard greens  peppers  and baby corn sprinkled in - very refreshing when a complimentary side salad is more than green lettuce from a grocery store. The baguette was fine for my ham and cheese sandwich but wasn't the best in town. Still  a nice option for lunch in the area. They have an outdoor seating area as well as a half dozen tables inside. I might give this local place a go and try a crepe or an interesting bulgogi burger which is enticingly interesting for a French bakery."", 'Went by today got 3 croissants and hot chocolate my mother in law loved the chocolate croissants she ate 2 and I had the almond croissant it was delicious and the hot chocolate was very good as well.

Bonjour!"" \n\nBonjour was a pleasant experience from the moment I enter this small bakery in the corner of a busy shopping plaza. Its been years I haven\'t been to this bakery because I had a few bad experience from the previous owners. However  the change in owners and staff made a big difference on this particular visit. Thanks to Renee N. for the recommendation that I should try them out again. Everything I had was delicious  especially the Ham & Cheese Croissant with a side salad. The croissant was soft in the inside and flakey on the outside overall it had a good texture to it. It wasn\'t overcooked. The ham and cheese were equally consistent and paired well with the croissant. The Pumpkin cake  was balanced in sweetness and not too bland. I would come back for this particular pastry. I got a chocolate and almond croissant to go and they were both up to par especially the almond croissant. I will return to try out more of the items offered at this unique bakery in the future.\n\nFYI: The owner is a Korean lady from Sweden  who speaks multiple languages.\n\n2017 Yelp Review #51', ""I liked it the first time i was there.My second visit was not so nice.The store smelled like Sewage  and the pastries looked dry and old.I don't think that i will return any time soon."", 'Nice  small coffeeshop/bakery.

Delicious and beautiful little desserts and amazing coffee. Great place for breakfast  brunch  or lunch with menu items like omelets  crepes  soups  salads and sandwiches. Added bonus they had vegetarian and vegan options. The owners are friendly and provide great customer service.', 'I was in the area and saw this place on Yelp and figured it was worth a try.  I was craving a croissant and thought if a French bakery doesn\'t have the best croissants  no one would.  I went around lunch time and there were only two others in the place.  The first thing I noticed was how super hot it was. Not sure if the a/c was off or what. The lady at the counter was very friendly and I\'d give her all the stars in the world. After I ordered my ham and cheese croissant the lady came over to let me know that they didn\'t have any croissants. What?!?!  French bakery and no croissants.  Hmm...ok.  I ended up having the ham and cheese on the baguette.  It was pretty good.  The baguette was fresh and was a good alternative.  However  at this point I\'m still head scratching as to why no croissants at noon on a weekday. The side salad was ok.  It had those little baby corns like Tom Hanks eats in the movie ""Big.""  I\'m not a fan of the little corns but that\'s ok.  I opted out of having a dessert even though they looked good.  I was still hung up on the no croissant deal. I\'m unsure if I want to try this place again.', ""The location is under new ownership  and having not visited before  I have nothing to compare it too. I'm absolutely fine with that though  because Bonjour Bakery & Deli was an absolute delight.\n\nI wanted a place to pop in for a quick breakfast and a coffee while I got some work done. They are located in a big shopping center  so there is parking aplenty. I walked in to be greeted by a pastry case of the finest treats. They have a large chalkboard menu  and some of their more savory breakfast options include omelettes  croque monsieur  and a ham and cheese croissant. And fear not. They still make the famous almond croissant that I heard nearly every guest order while I sipped my almond milk latte.\n\nThis isn't the place where you're going to get fancy latte art  but I enjoyed the creaminess of the dairy alternative and the smooth flavor of their espresso. I devoured my ham and cheese croissant. They fly their butter in from France  and you can taste the difference as the flaky pastry dances across your tongue. The side salad that accompanied was a forest of vegetables with a champagne vinaigrette.\n\nWhat really caught my eye was how warm and welcoming the staff and owner were to every guest. They were greeted with either a warm smile or a warm hug. You can tell that they are really trying to build a community and take pride in what they do. \n\nThis was a little reminder and taste of my time in France  merci!"", 'Best French toast ever. New owners struggling to keep up with the demands of running a bakery/coffee shop. Couple of customers left empty handed as the baguettes were unavailable in the morning. But a nice place for breakfast.

Excellent choice by the way. This light pastry was fresh and scrumptious! Definitely one of the better ""French"" bakeries I\'ve been to around town. I\'ll definitely be back soon to experience some of the renovations the new owners shared!!', 'The new owners of this long extant bakery have true Swedish roots.

I usually get the 'flavor savor' which has a trio of different items to try. The hummus and rolled grape leaves are good too. They always have fresh and tasty food."", ""I love Aladdin's  I just wish it was a little cheaper. The food is great  and it has a casual atmosphere that you can be comfortable in whether you're out with family  kids  friends  a date or even alone.  There are several locations around Cleveland.  I've tried a few of the menu items and everything has been delicious.  \n\nOn my most recent visit I had the beef shawarma salad and we ordered a large hummus for the table of 3 of us. The large hummus was large  we barely made a dent in it.  My salad was delicious but I felt it was a few dollars too expensive for a plate of lettuce and a small-ish portion of beef. Taste alone  though  I have no complaints! \n\nThe sandwich wraps are probably a better deal than the entrees and salads.  They are around $6-7 and big enough to make a meal. \n\nFrom what I hear the family that owns Aladdin's is somehow related to the folks who run Sittoo's which I personally feel is much more reasonable in price and equally delicious. The same salad that is $7 at Sittoos is $12 at Aladdin's. But hey  sometimes location and convenience is everything."", 'I love their food! I just went there for pickup and I was greeted as soon as I walked in. The lady was really nice. She was patient with me while I looked through the menu. It took my awhile because I had a cranky three yr old with me.  The food was hot and fresh. They had a really good selection of made-on-site desserts. \nI ordered the chicken curry pita wrap add it was made perfectly!  My son had the chicken cheese pita pitza and my husband has the chicken Dijon pita wrap. All of it was fresh  hot  and quickly made.', ""My wife and I have wanted to try this restaurant for a long time  and we finally made it. \nWe were shown our table and before we were even seated we were asked what we wanted to drink  which I thought very unusual.  We gave our waitress our selections.  She came back promptly and asked if we were ready to order  which we weren't since they have many dishes on their menu and this was our first time there.  She seemed put off by this since we weren't ready when she was.  \n\nWhen we made a decision on our meals  she was busy with other tables  which is fine. When she came back  my wife ordered the beef shawarma  and I had the falafel appetizer.  She never checked on us at to see if we wanted more tea or water.  I want to point out that restaurant was not busy  there were only 13 customers  including ourselves.  There were a total of 3 or 4 waitresses at the time  so it is not like they were slammed or anything.\n\nWhen our order came  she never checked on us again to see if everything was ok. Another waitress came and asked about our order  but by that time it was not relevant.  \nMy falafel was ok  just not my cup of tea.  so I left it.  The beef shawarma was very good.  The portion was huge  enough for 2 or 3 meals  so we took the rest home.  It took some time for our waitress to come back to the table to give us a take home container and the bill.  She had to be flagged down by one of her co-workers to take care of us.\n\nI just think that the priorities they have as far as their duties doesn't include taking care of their customers first and foremost.  Cleaning and setting up tables seemed to be a priority over customer service and satisfaction.\nTheir menu looks interesting  and I am sure very good by the very many positive reviews I read before going there.  \nNo matter how good their food may be  the dining experience was ruined by the inattentive waitress.  I only gave them a one star due to service we received  not for the quality of the food."", ""The secret to enjoying Aladdin's (besides simply making sure that Middle Eastern fast food is your thing) is to understand its limitations. \n\nMainly  that's the pitas. Everything is pita (would it kill them to make the spinach-feta pie with a flaky crust?)  and the pita is only so-so and dry. So make sure to order things that provide plenty of moistness.\n\nIf you do that  Aladdin's is pretty good."", 'Strawberry smoothies are awesome. Perfect sweetness to it with the honey in it. The veggie chili and V-9 soup are tasty as well. The hummus is good with fresh parsley and oil drizzled on top.', ""This was my family's first time here. Great service and great food! We tried their hummus and pita bread  which was fantastic! They have a very large menu! Lots of choices. Good for vegetarian and vegan. I tried the fsiha pita which was spiced beef... Awesome.

I also enjoy their chicken salad"", ""Got a falafel for take out.  OK  but I've definitely had better.  I wouldn't go back to get this unless I really couldn't find anything else to eat.

Staff have always been attentive and courteous. Don't forget to get the hummus and pita bread also another favorite."", 'It is so REFRESHING to find a restaurant like this in Mentor  where large steak-and-potato-chains dominate.

They have middle eastern fare that is prepared simply and with a lot of flavor. I am a creature of habit and order the same 3-4 dishes every time I eat here. Jasmine's favorite is usually what I get that is loaded with dirty rice and grilled veggie and beans. You can add protein or salad on top if you are vegetarian. They have a few different sauces if you want to dip into more calories. Their hummus and baba is the fresh and made on site daily. The pita is delicious and I always get double."", ""Favorite place  all locations are on point. Food is always perfect  staff is always wonderful.

Next on the hit list was  of course  the always phenominal Lentil Soup  just as good as my fiance's grandmothers!  Today I tried the Aladdin's Salad for a change of pace and a little bit lighter of a lunch.  It was fresh  flavorful and filling!  Service was very quick for lunch without feeling you are being rushed out the door.  The manager even came by to ask how everything was shortly after the waiter followed up.  I thought this was nice  because it seems like the manager is very engaged in the front of the house  and is starting to recognize us."", 'Went again to Aladdins.

He was very nice and we felt bad but most of our orders got screwed up.', ""Excellent food and service! I got the shish kebab platter and it was delicious  the beef was so medium rare it melted in your mouth! The garlic sauce was amazing! The desert cabinet was nearly pornographic!

I wish it was a little more cozy!"", 'Great atmosphere and wonderful fresh food. Barbara was a personable and knowledgeable server.

The best place to come to if you're a vegan or vegetarian and looking for options besides the typical salad or frozen veggie burger. \n\nWe always start with the hummus and their house made hot sauce...SO good. The pita is endless  but f you're looking to cut some calories  try the veggies.

Even so  we always receive friendly service."", ""Excellent Mediterranean food. I come here and get the hummus every single time. The majudra (I think that's how you spell it) is a very interesting  but delicious meal. The tuna steak salad with the cilantro dressing is also incredible. \n\nOverall  there aren't many options for Mediterranean food in this sea of chain restaurants that is Mentor  Oh.

But their hummus and their baba ghanouj is an absolute must last every time you visit this establishment. And you can't skip on the desert. They have amazing desserts at these restaurants. Every time I come I bring home A container of baklava."", ""YUMMY!  My husband and I always have great  friendly  service at Aladdin's.   The food is consistently delicious; the restaurant is very clean and the staff genuine.\nAs a vegetarian- I am always pleased with the countless selections of delightful options!"", ""The only reason this place gets a 4 star rating instead of a 5 is that it simply cannot handle a group.

I've had lunch here a few times and always admire the dessert case but manage to pass it up. Everyone had a sweet tooth tonight  so I went on a run. \n\nThere were a few gluten free choices and a lot of flavor variety. We  aren't gluten free but tried the gluten free cake. It was actually my 14 year olds top choice of the four! It had cherry filling and a fudge icing. The limoncello cake was lite and lemony with a very refreshing  sweet taste. The brownie cheesecake was rich and decedent without being overly sweet. It is heavy enough though to share a piece with someone. The carrot cake was a perfect mix of slightly dense with a nice crumb. It had good spice flavor without dry fruit added. It did have small pieces of walnut but nothing that got in the way of the cake texture. The cream cheese frosting had the perfect amount of sweetness. \n\nWhen I've eaten in house  I enjoy the house hummus plate and vege plate. I'm not a big fan of some of the other dishes I've tried  but the ingredients are always fresh. The pita does seem on the dry side to me. \n\nThere were several pickup orders going out when I was there. They make fresh juices and smoothies also with whole ingredients. I'll have to try one sometime. The restaurant ambience is kind of blah. This seems like an ideal place for healthy takeout dining."", ""I went here when I was in town for Thanksgiving  but have been going to an Aladdin's for YEARS.

Generally prices are fair... even when they charge for extra dressings and hot sauce it's still worth it!"", ""This is considered our fast food restaurant of choice. Excellent healthy food! If we are out and about we stop and get a tabouleh salad and a V-9 or lentil soup. Don't feel sick afterwards like I do when I eat at McDonald's. This is real food and a change from the steak and potato and wing places in Mentor. Service is always great."", ""I read the reviews before I ordered through DoorDash. Ordered the lamb pita which was overcooked  had 2-3 small pieces of lamb inside  pita was also over toasted. My children's chicken  and cheese pitza also overcooked  falafels overcooked. I'm not sure what happened but I was very disappointed in the food. Flavors was there but execution was horrible."", 'Food is really good. I love the vegetarian sampler. Hot sauce is a must. Staff is friendly and attentive.', ""Friendly and fast service!  I needed to be in and out in 30 minutes and managed it without feeling rushed.\n\nReceived pita bread with my meal  but no hummus.  That's okay  I was pleased with the complimentary pita bread."", ""Stopped here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. It wasn't crowded  was seated right away. The hostess was friendly. Server was nice. The chicken chili was excellent and falafel appetizer was very good. We shared a chicken sambusek that was really good too. It was $28.52 for two people."", 'We would eat here every day if we could. Everything on the menu looks yummy. I always have a hard time deciding what to order. Service is prompt  friendly  and attentive. Prices a little high  but well worth it.', 'Amazing! What a find in Mentor  OH!!! I live in CA and would expect a place this authentic  fresh and healthy there  but it was such a refreshing find on a quick visit to OH. Every single item was yummy. We went for lunch with a group of 8  and there was not one item left on any of the plates at the end of our meal. \nIs Aladdin coming to Cali?']"

I especially liked the layout with all the screens conveniently located and visible from everywhere. While nothing was particularly unique about the pub  there was nothing noticeably wrong with it either. The service and food were good and reasonably priced. While the place is not deficient in any obvious way  I have not had any ""wow"" moments on my first visit.\n\nVerdict: This is a pub you want to go to get drunk. It does the job  and does it well. What it lacks is flavor and uniqueness.', 'Great food. We started with the beef yorkie. FANTASTIC. I had the butter chicken and it was better than most Idian restaurants.\n\nI was also with a business associate and he had the Ruban sandwich. He said it was great and recommended it to his friend who arrived after we finished eating.\n\nAs the place got busier  the service started to decline. This location only has bar top tables inside.\n\nThere is two patios. One on the ground floor and one on the roof. I hear the upstairs patio has a limited menu.\n\nOverall  we agreed that we would return again.', 'I had eaten at the TnT in the north many times.  I often thought of them as one of the original good food pubs  they always have a great patio feel too. We walked into the mackenzie location On a sunny Saturday afternoon and the place was dead.  No one even said hello. We were going to head up to the patio and were promptly told it was not open.  Ok still I had not given up because I\'ve always had a great meal in the north.  So you can imagine how disappointed I was when the food was awful at the mackenzie location.  I was so in the mood for fish and chips but when I asked the waitress how they were she said "" I wouldn\'t order them"" well that took that craving away fast.  We ordered The Maui rib off the appie menu  it tasted burnt and the flavour was mediocre.  We had the ""stacked"" pastrami sandwich with broccoli slaw.  Stacked was a gross understatement  gently layered would have better described it.  You could not even taste the mustard  which made the sandwich blah.  The broccoli slaw was down right awful  we actually sent it back.  It tasted old and woody.  \nSuper disappointed. With so many choices I would be hard pressed to find a reason to go back.', 'Really disappointed this time our server was not happy @ all. Mostly because she was responsible for tooooo many tables and was just trying to keep up. The food seemed not very fresh. The grey coloured coleslaw was kind of off putting just like the flavour. Not sure I would return.', 'Terrible service.\nliterally sat at the bar in front of the bartender for 20 mins while he ignored us. Then a couple sat down right beside us and the bartender introduced himself to them and served them right away.\nat that point i got up and walked out', 'If possible would give it no stars - worst service ever  took over twenty minutes for our server to come back with our drinks and then never came back to ask if wanted anything else', ""The new TnT just opened yesterday after many months of waiting.\n\nOn a quasi-holiday Monday  the place was fairly busy around 5:00. They don't have their rooftop patio or little side patio on the ground floor open yet  but the pub was about half full. \n\nThere was a fairly hefty amount of staff on tonight with two hostesses greeting us at the door. The server was prompt at getting us set up with their new menu and a few beverages. I wanted a beer and it was great to see how many different options they have on tap  including craft options from the likes of Tool Shed and Fernie Brewing.\n\nI started with a Tool Shed Star Cheek IPA  always a favourite. \n\nTo eat  I thought I would go with one of the TnT signature options never having been to a Toad 'n Turtle before. I chose the brisket wrap with a side of yam fries and chipotle mayo. \n\nThe brisket was alright and overall the wrap was disappointing. It was just the brisket with some cabbage. While I think that the brisket should be the hero of the dish  there should be more to it than some cabbage to add a little crunch. The yam fries were good  but the chipotle mayo really completed the meal.\n\nNearing the end of the visit I polished off a pint of Purple Gas from Big Rock. Its the Toads' seasonal pick right now. Tasty and not extremely sweet as so many fruit beers are.\n\nThe staff are clearly new and there's things still being worked out. Our server was a little flustered at times as it seems that she doesn't have her routine quite figured out yet. However  overall it was still a pleasant experience."", 'Surprised on a Monday the kitchen would close at 10. We had a group of 35-40 people in for a meeting and were surprised that no food was available after. Such a shame. Earls helped us out.', 'I think they will do ok  good location but limited menu to start. Biggest issue was that the establishment has clearly not set up their beer choices correctly. I ordered a pint of bud and when it arrived it was a small 16 oz glass not a std 20 oz glass. I questioned the waitress who was no help  the Manager explained that they do both sizes of domestic all though where I come from a pint is 20 oz not 16.  It is misleading and not correct and the prices are not reflective of a smaller size glass. Beware when ordering your pint.', ""This one is a bit of a toss up between bad service or having delicious food. \nWent there this evening and sat in that patio. They brought out my food which was right  then my boyfriends was wrong. He had to wait an extra 15 mins to receive the right food. By the time he received the right order I was done my meal. Kitchen is slow to rectify issues  and the servers aren't too attentive. Waited a while to receive drinks.\nIf you don't mind slow service the food is excellent."", 'Best resturant stew i have ever tasted. Its a boof bourguignon but lamb. OMG. Bringing family back for supper soon.', ""If I could rank lower then 1 star I would. Terrible service  terrible food. Don't eat here unless you want to be tied to your toilet for 2 days afterward. \n\nShrimp tacos - NO. Greasy (how?!)  doused in mayo\nBeef stroganoff- basically dog food warmed up on noodles\n\nWill NOT be back."", ""This pub should be better than it is and that is not to suggest it is bad.  There just seems to be something lacking. Went in for lunch on Sunday aft and there wasn't a lot going on.  The pub is hollow and not particularly warm. Maybe has to do with open space or laminate flooring. Maybe it just hasn't gained character yet since it is new. \n\nAlrighty then  our server was attentive and helpful. The beer special was reasonable enough to order a draught and there were appetizing food specials.  Opted for the Roast Turkey Poutine.  Wow! Who knew a Thanksgiving Christmas Easter meal could be so delicious on fries and cheese curd? Portion was huge and delicious! \n\nAgain  a good spot that I try occasionally and don't mind recommending."", ""We love coming to Toad & Turtle!  Their wing nights are great - so many flavours to choose from!  And sometimes we just don't feel like cooking and will come for 2-for-1 appetizer nights.  Their beer and wine selection is great.  Fast and friendly service  and a laid back atmosphere.  Definitely a great local pub!"", ""The brunch options here are great. I've been here a few times now and have never been disappointed. The breakfast poutine is a large portion and the hashbrowns are always nice and crispy. This is probably the best option for brunch in the shopping centre as there is no line so you're not waiting 20 minutes to sit down to eat a mediocre crepe at Cora's.\n\nSince they've opened the service has continued to improve."", ""It's pub food and football! No worries watching your favorite NFL team here!! \nGreat game day atmosphere. Good food cold beer. You get it!"", 'The menu had promise online  so without further thought on ""where should we dine"" we got in the car and drove ourselves to TNT. \n\nI didn\'t like the interior much and the other ambience aspects weren\'t great either. We sat at a high table and waited for service (was probably in the 10 minute mark) which wouldn\'t have been so bad if we had menus. When our server did come over she asked what we wanted... and I politely said ""menus?"" this seemed to make her annoyed. \n\nWhen it came down to ordering food  we got the veggie cocktail  calamari and the pulled pork poutine. The veggie platter and calamari were both not what I expected. Calamari was rubbery and greasy. Veggies came in an actual plastic cocktail glass from a dollar store - I don\'t know what they are going for there but it isn\'t working. \n\nThe poutine was good but very  very salty and we just couldn\'t finish it. All in all  I think there are much better places to go in Calgary and will not be going back  unless it\'s not by choice.', 'We went to the Toad N Turtle on New Years ever and it was fairly busy but we started out with really great service.\nIt did get a little slower and less great though as we were there longer.   Our waitress forgot about us a few times and so it took about 30 mins to even get wings ordered and then the draft beer we had was very flat so we asked for bottles and 10 mins later she brought more draft beers???  so we then asked again for bottles as the second set was flat as well.  over 30 mins later we finally got our beer.\nOur wings and dinner were amazing!  Brisket is done right there (if you take off the cabbage)\nOur service got better just before we left but food was good so hoping it was a 1 time thing.\nI would recommend TnT but maybe not their draft.', 'The toad and turtle sucks food sucks staff sucks   beer sucks service was terrible on the roof top patio never went back again   the toad is a breeding ground for morons', ""I'd give them no stars if I could.  I have a food allergy  one that can be lethal to me (depending on how much I consume).  As a result  I try not to eat out much  as it's always a risk.\n\nBy far one of the worst experiences I've had in the way a restaurant has managed my allergy.  The waitress  although slow  made a couple of trips to the kitchen to see what would work best.  As far as I can see  she did her best to take care of me. \n\nPartway through my meal  I felt the telltale itching in my throat  and pulled aside the server.  I had identified what I thought might be the source of my allergen  and she headed to the kitchen  saying she'd confirm.  \n\nFive minutes later  she was serving drinks to other patrons  and still hadn't swung by. Another five minutes after that  she came back  confirming they'd contaminated my food and asking if I wanted anything else. \n\nAnd risk them making things worse?  No. \n\nThe assistant general manager then stopped by the table.  He had a very 'so what' attitude  tried to blame the waitress  and said that the kitchen had not been made aware of my allergy.  He did not at any point ask if I was okay or express any concern about my well-being.\n\nSo I'm at home  covered in hives  and displeased with the way my Friday has gone.  If you have a food allergy  do your best to keep away."", ""We stopped here eat as part of pub crawl around the area  the male host informed us we were being too loud and hinted at us to leave. Luckly for us  we didn't get to eat the terrible food. To bad for them  our bill at the next stop was around $500... \n\nThey should be nicer to large groups of people."", ""Had tried a few of the other places in the area for a Sunday Brunch  and wanted to try something new.  This place didn't have a 15 minute wait when we arrived and got a table and service right away; so that was a plus right off the bat.  Breakfast/Brunch menu has some really creative options that will cure that hangover from the night before.  Really hearty meals with lots of protein and carbs to help get you going.  \nSundays (at the time we went) they have Caesars on special; and they have a few different ones to try - the perfect pair for a Sunday Brunch.\nI had the Breakfast Poutine. I was a large serving loaded with lots of ingredients and topped off with ample amounts of cheese curds and Hollandaise sauce.  It really filled the void in my stomach and I was stuffed when it was all gone.  The price was very fair too. \nI will be going back to try the other breakfast items in the near future!"", 'Almost room temperature beer   grouchy service average food.  Will never bring the guys here again.  Really nice interior though.', 'They have different special features every month! \nRight now for October they have a Donair Taco and it is absolutely delicious! \nAs well  on Tuesdays it is Tacos where it is $3 a taco and Wednesdays is their wing night!', ""Another great deep south east Calgary pub option! \n\nI've dropped into TnT a few times now  including once for our National Chicken Wing Day Wing Eating Competition  and I have to say the team at the Toad is great to work with and the service each time has been top notch. I love the fact they have two of my fave craft beers available (Village and Toolshed) and the chicken wings at this place are off the hook! Easily some of the biggest wings you'll find in town on a wing night  and a ton of flavours to choose from  including their weekly special wing flavour. I believe me  I know chicken wings.\n\nI dropped in on a Saturday morning at 10am for their $5.99 breakfast deal and left stuffed. \n\nGreat patio on the rooftop  and lesser awesome patio on the side which unfortunately gets traffic going by it constantly but still lets you sit out in the sun.\n\nTwo wings up for this place!""]"

This bar opened in September 2016 so it is totally reasonable that they would still be figuring things out  and I want to love this bar and hangout here all the time  so here are my notes in the spirit of that hope. \n\nWe walked by and got excited  and came back to check it out. First impressions  really nice looking cozy bar. New but feels timeless  warm lighting  romantic corners  lovely bar and DJ setup along the back and shelves of someone's quirky awesome record collection everywhere.  We were warmly welcomed when we arrived and given menus that had us exclaiming with excitement over the tasty sounding descriptions of their cocktails and snacks. Great start. \n\nIt took our waitress a noticeably long time to take our order  but then the crazy delay came after. You know when you reach a point waiting for your order where your whole table is just staring with confusion at the bar able to think of anything else besides where they went so wrong in life to be sitting in limbo like that? It was like that  plus the records were skipping and screeching and in some cases repeating whole songs over again. We finally saw our cocktails arrive on a tray only to see the waitress bring them back to the bartender because of a mistake in the order. When the drinks did arrive they were close to good  but not there yet. Flavours were all mixed up  smoky and over sweet and just not right. \n\nThe popcorn we ordered was the highlight  freshly made and super tasty lemon pepper topping. We also loved that people from the few other tables that were full got up to dance  and we found our waitress super nice. \n\nLike I say  huge potential  can't wait to see them work the kinks out and become a really kickass bar."", 'Cette place est récente  ouverte depuis Septembre 2016.\n\nC\'est un peu à contre-coeur ou par compromis que je me suis ramassé au Bar Le Record  mais je dois admettre que j\'ai bien aimé. C\'est vraiment un endroit qui fait ""bar local"" des gens dans Villeray  c\'est un peu dans le nord de St-Hubert et c\'est un peu dépaysant par rapport au quartier. La meilleures façon de décrire cet endroit est musical! Le Record est une place ou il y a un DJ qui mets des vyniles. Il y a une collection ma fois extrêmement active et la suite musicale de la soirée a été cohérente  agréable et pas trop fort. Oui oui! un bar avec un volume raisonnable qui fait qu\'on est capable de se parler et d\'écoute de la bonne musique. C\'est un bar à cocktail qui sont délicieux et pas trop dispendieux. J\'ai eut une belle soirée avec un endroit très bien aménagé. Nous étions dans le coin et c\'était agréable d\'avoir notre petit coin pour discuté sans être pour autant envahit par les gens. C\'est une belle place pour une date musicale et un endroit avec du beau monde! La moyenne d\'âge était de 25 ans et plus. C\'était sympa d\'avoir un bar plutôt adulte pour faire changement.', ""Petit bar de quartier tout ce qu'il y a de plus charmant  relax et sans aucune prétention.\n\nLes prix sont vraiment bas. Verre de cidre 5$ par exemple. \n\nBarman très sympathique. \n\nTerrasse.""]"
