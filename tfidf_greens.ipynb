       "' save your money and time it took over an hour just to get our lunch served and there was hardly anyone in the restaurant even after expressing to our waiter that we were in a rush n nordered off the basic taste of the island menu the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless not impressed especially for a restaurant near the asu downtown campus lots of other places that serve good quality food at a reasonable time the restaurant is quaint very pretty unfortunately the food is not as good as the place looks and the prices are not to put with the food either too pricey for a mediocre meal the pork chop is so tough you would expect a soft cut and such but they didn t cook it well t was like eating shoe leather the crab cakes are just bread barely any crab such a rip off they should invest on providing quality food having such a cute place the server was confused and scattered my whole party was unimpressed with the food would not recommend for food but only for drinks and the ambience heard about the breadfruit in an article in az vines wines it sounded so good we couldn t wait to try it it was outstanding the drinks the service the staff was amazing the food just incredible we can t wait to go again highly recommend it nwe just moved here from the east coast we are trying as many rest as we can nthis place is a must after years of visiting the rum bar for cocktails we finally got the chance to try the breadfruit for dinner i was so impressed by the excellent service my water glass was never empty i was given a fresh set of silverware between courses and all of my questions were promptly answered n ni got the red stripe curry prawns with rice and roasted vegetables the spice was perfect they are known for their jerk spice after all n nmy partner got the jerk pork and polenta and said that the ratio between pork and polenta seemed a little off but was otherwise very tasty i went to the breadfruit last night for dinner my mussels were absolutely delicious and so were the fresh rum cocktails they made however warning the menu is pricey and the portions are small i was still hungry when i left and i am a lb female it doesn t take much to make me full my suggestion go here for drinks apps go somewhere with adult sized portions for dinner breadfruit is honestly one of my favorite spots in phoenix my fiancé and i frequently come here whether it be to just enjoy a cocktail or have a delicious meal and romantic date night i highly recommend getting the scallops they are always perfectly cooked and i ve never been anywhere that serves a scallop dish that even comes close to what breadfruit offers service is also always incredible i came here a few weeks ago for my birthday the servers were nice the food was good the rum punch was excellent the portions were a nice size we had the coconut curried tofu smoked fish cabbage canape sorrel etc the rum menu is amazing they use local produce organic ingredients and i love the chic environment i must admit i wasn t too keen on the host up front he was a bit abrasive to my guests so you lost one star for that but overall we had a good time in the outside patio and i would return to try some other things took a friend here yesterday as she s new to town and hasn t yet experienced all downtown phoenix has to offer told her i thought breadfruit had some of the best food and drinks in downtown phoenix she said was curious about the place but was always reluctant because it had a low yelp rating so i came on here to see what was up n nyes they make the food the way the want without substitution cocktails are mixed the way they please too yes you cannot eat on their back patio boo hoo yes they only seat whole parties not all that uncommon n nget over it people you want great well balanced flavors and innovative rum cocktails i recommend the shorty make reservations you won t regret it delicious i ll be back for seconds and thirds and fourths n nin quintissential phoenix style breadfruit is housed in an unassuming small space in a nondescript neighborhood close to the heart of downtown the space itself needs a little more character and decor to qualify for true phoenix hidden gem status at the moment but it s only the first week of its existence so time will tell n nstill i was sold at first glance of the menu lots of stuff i ve never heard of with descriptions that all tempted the taste buds i decided to zero in on the brown chicken stew which is actually not a stew at all but however you want to describe it it was damn tasty as a starter my friend and i also split a two dollar chicken curry patty which i d describe as a cross between the crust of an apple less apple turnover a samosa and chicken curry yum i could see myself going back just to eat another one of those alone n na small complaint one that i don t often have at american restaurants that are addicted to overstuffing their obese customers concerns the portion size i do like and favor smaller portions at any restaurant i go to but the brown chicken stew was just so good that it left me wanting just a notch more also beware if you re new to this particular entree as i was because the chicken contains bones n nthe service is alright the waitstaff struck me more as just a bunch of dudes as opposed to professional waiters waitresses but the dude we had was perfectly friendly n nanother great addition to the downtown scene i suggest they consider expanding their friday and saturday night hours though very hard place to locate the building is shadowed by trees and they dont do take out rum bar is such a neat little place their mojitos are some of the best i ve had in phoenix they contain large sprigs of fresh mint and good rum i ve tried some of other drinks and they were fine but i don t like to deviate too far from my beloved mojito i love to sit on the patio during the cooler months and pretend i m in a place other than phoenix this place was a terrible disappointment tonight they have made their portions smaller and more expensive the staff was inexperienced and insensitive leaving us hanging most of the night overall sad what this place has become we love this place every time has been awesome the food the drinks the service just great go when i was little i was a very picky eater i liked what i liked and would throw a fit if i had to eat something on my do not eat list but something changed as an adult now i am much more adventurous when it comes to food except for ketchup i still can t eat that stuff n nso when it comes to trying new restaurants and foods i am more than happy to take a risk and that is what led me to breadfruit yeah jamaican food isn t like a culinary feat and although i love cuban food a cousin to jamaican food you could say i d never ventured to the spicier side of caribbean cuisine but wow i m so glad i did n nit was a lovely friday afternoon when a work friend suggested we head over to breadfruit for a long leisurely lunch and i must say breadfruit was a great antidote to a stressful work week after waiting just a little too long for our menus we were greeted by a friendly waiter who gave us some recommendations on drinks my friend had the carrot coconut juice he loves his carrot juice so he was thrilled they had it on the menu and loved every sip of it i on the other hand just had their house iced tea they had a lot of other beverage options i just wanted to avoid something too sweet n nthere was a decent selection of menu choices and everything sounded delicious so it was tough for me to decided which meal would whet my appetite my friend had the jerk chicken which he said was spicy of course but fantastic i had the brown stew chicken and in my best rachel zoe it was ba na nas the chicken was cooked wonderfully and the flavorful sauce was so complex and delicious my taste buds sang a glorious hallelujah n ni can t wait to go back and try more from their menu i was totally eying the plantain avocado spring rolls love plantains and love avocados so i know i would love this and i was really wanting to try the curried chicken dumplings but i was afraid if i had that for lunch i would be in a food coma for the rest of the day n nyou know a place is good while during your first visit you are already planning what your next meal will be so for that reason alone i d say it was another great culinary adventure for me yeah the food here is delicious excellent curry and beans and rice my only gripe is that they were not family friendly i have never been in a restaurant that would not make small accommodations for a child here s the deal we asked for the fruit and veggies that go into one of their salads but not the full salad and the answer was a rather abrupt and unapologetic no so we ordered the full salad with the dressing on the side with to obvious intent to give the fruits and veggies to my child and guess what the salad came out all mixed up then the server watched us pick all the foods and veggies out of the salad and said not a thing n ni have never experienced such appalling service i certainly will not go here again no matter how good the food best scallops everrrrrr i m telling you they will change your life all the food i ve had here has been awesome they had an insane amount of rum choices and the bartenders are very knowledgeable and will give you pointers if you tell them what you like they make great mixed rum drinks but even sipping on some of the nicer rums they have is a fun experience it seems like they ve had a lot of bartender turnover but i ve also seen a lot of them get trained and they do a great job of teaching them about the rums food service etc if i was rating it just on food or drinks i d give them stars a million times over the service can sometimes be sketchy when they re busy though which is frustrating considering it s certainly not an inexpensive place to eat and drink based on my one dinner i would eat here everyday if i could i want to try everything it is a vegan paradise now i ve never been to jamaica so i don t know the real deal but i ve been to caribbean restaurants n nwe shared the avocado plantain spring rolls but i think we could have each finished our own they were simply that good the person i went with usually eats like a bird barely tastes her food and leaves food over not here unless you consider a vulture a bird wow i ve never seen her go for food like this n nshe ordered the pop cho and sweet ginger loved it and finished the entire serving didn t care for the cabbage side which she found too peppery note that the sweet potato that comes with this dish is actually a regular potato prepared sweetly so adjust your expectation it s still qute good she liked my dish too but said hers was better a bit competitive too n ni had the coconut curry tofu it had amazing and unique tastes absolutely delicious n nunfortunately we had no room for dessert but i have no doubt i ll be back again soon for more n nthis will soon be part of the pre theater rotation rude staff and pretentious food upon arriving there for the first time we were seated immediately we were asked if we had ever done there before when replying no we are then spoken to like we were children granted it was our first time but not the first time we ve been out to dinner and definitely not the first time i ve been to a jamaican restaurant n nwhen trying to order a drink the waitstaff insisted we have the daily punch even after asking about several other drinks on the menu we were directed to the daily punch when i tried to order an item off the menu i was told that that s a different plate on fridays and saturdays with a price tag higher huh n nwe were there exactly one hour before the entrées came out everyone sitting around eyes had received their entrées and or had already left when the food came out it was absolutely delicious but the portions were small leaving me hungry which almost never happens the waitstaff we re just not friendly enough and definitely did not make us feel welcomed n nwe won t be back i know many places on the east and west coasts that have even better food for half the prices and have genuinely happy people working there the ital food was so good the atmosphere was cool and welcoming great food incredible service perfect ambiance for a romantic date n nour server was sweet and knowledgable and recommended our appetizers strongly suggest the rockfish ceviche i ordered the jerk chicken which was a bit too spicey and i like spicy food but it was still delicious my guy loved his prawns too it was great the service was seriously commendable everyone was so on the ball loved it and will be back authentic chic and inventive n nthis cocktail list really takes the love of rum to a new level the categories or courses are meant to be savored our server for the evening explained his favorites as well as the daily punch bowl my husband opts for the punch bowl and i start my journey down permanent brain cell damage i hear they grow back n nwe wait in the booth inside during this warm night for our friend to arrive around pm or so once she arrives luke i think our server takes us to our table and continues the amazingness n nmy adventurous husband invites luke to bring suggestions including a unique smoked pineapple rum concoction as it was our friends birthday he brings a huge rum sniffer and a shot if some fabulous rum he really made our experience at this local gem memorable update nwe went back to breadfruit last night and i must revise my original review to reflect our experience which deserved more stars n nwhen we arrived at pm on saturday night the place was packed there wasn t enough room to push two tables together in order to accommodate our party of so we walked around the block until some tables were open the waitress was extremely nice and we were seated about minutes later n nfor appetizers we ordered the avocado spring rolls and the roasted plantains despite being small portions they were both very good i was inspired to go get some plantains in the asian market this morning in order to try to make them at home n nas an entree i ordered the curried tofu again i wanted to try something else the ital soup or the veggie patty but they were out of a vital component of each dish and they don t make the soup in the summer n nwhen my entree came out i was initially really disappointed to see that they had made it with chicken again i asked the waitress and she assured me that what i was seeing was actually a soy product and i had nothing to worry about i must say it was disturbingly uncomfortably meat like so much so that i made my husband try it and tell me that it was in fact non meat before i would put it in my mouth when i did eat it it even had the texture of meat very disconcerting the flavor was excellent and i would definitely order this entree again if i can get over the extremely realistic meat analog the sides were good definitely better flavor since last time especially mixed with the curry sauce n ni have to issue a heartfelt apology to wayne and the breadfruit for the disparaging review that i wrote after my last visit i should have called to ask about the dish and had them clarify that my dish was in fact fake meat it has been so long since i ate chicken and i don t generally eat fake meat that i truly thought it was meat lesson don t assume anything n nmy dinner companions all ordered a chicken dish and all enjoyed them thoroughly i tried the festivals breadstick from someone s meal and i have to say that breadfruit should offer a basket of those as an appetizer yum n nwhen we were almost finished with our meal the waitress brought us full sized samples of the carrot juice another yum it tasted a lot like thai iced tea similar seasonings and very rich and creamy n ni will definitely go back to breadfruit the food was good festivals crack the atmosphere and the service is excellent and it is close to home n nhome run breadfruit n n ndowntown phoenix needs a jamaican restaurant and an ethiopian italian mexican etc and i have waited anxiously for breadfruit to open riding my bike by there every afternoon for weeks looking for any sign of life n nfinally just this week i see people eating there so we went for lunch today at at the end of the lunch rush of course we arrived at the exact same moment as phil gordon i think we threw them off a little bit by ordering our meal to go but they don t get a by for that n nthe wait was long minutes but they were really busy and they just opened and the mayor was there so it was understandable we forgave the lone waiter brought me a fiji water it tided me over slightly n ni was excited to see several vegan options on the menu mostly sides but it looks like some of the entrees can be modified to fit vegetarian requirements n ni ordered the curried tofu that is the name printed on the menu no modifications which comes with sides of steamed plantains beans rice and steamed cabbage green bell peppers n nunfortunately i recieved curried chicken a fact that i discovered after getting back to my office and i was way too starving to go back to get it fixed i ate around the chicken something i am normally loathe to do but as i said starving n nthe beans and rice bland nothing spectacular they were just that beans and rice n nplantains undercooked just slightly i wanted them to be so much better than they were n ncabbage green bell pepper boring they were just steamed cabbage and green pepper i love cooked cabbage but with salt please n nnothing that i ate was seasoned at all i had bite or two of the curry sauce since it was touching the rice starving and it tasted ok am i allowed to pass judgement on a sauce that was poured over something i don t ever eat because i think it is disgusting its hard to say n nadmittedly i would have enjoyed this meal a lot more if i had recieved a meal that did not contain meat n ni will probably go back breadfruit is new and they deserve another chance i will definitely eat in and i will try david s reccomendation of the avocado rolls n none strike they haven t struck out just yet this place has amazing food and phenomenal cocktails explain your preferences to the server and they will suggest something matched to your tastes one of my favorite date night spots for special occasions the food and drinks are amazing and unique this is a hidden gem and it s on my permanent referral list for places to try in phoenix n ngreat drinks ngreat food ngreat atmosphere n ni ll be back incredible food and rum i can not express what a lovely experience we had for apps and outrageously delicious drinks wish i lived in phoenix i have now gone back twice daryl is an excellent addition to restaurant entrepreneurs in the historic district of phoenix giving us more rum than anyone could possibly consume nhis street chicken jerk chicken is spot on not too spicy and edible by anyone s palate nmy wife is not the biggest fan of jamaican cuisine but she still returns at my request if only the staff paid a little more attention to the patrons each time we go we tend to wait for service on ordering throughout the evening this wont stop us from returning though the food is just too good huge selection of rum and unique cocktails prepared by a very knowledgeable bartender the rum flights are a great way to taste the different types of rum this is a great lunch place in downtown phoenix and i am happy to say i am now a fan it took a while but they have it right now from when it first open to now its a total nthe menu is updated and the food is delicious neverything on the menu is flavorful and i can not complain oh and i love the plantains and their carrot coconut juice went to this place for the first time on a recommendation from a work colleague i had the whole black bass and it was excellent the rum drinks were also great i was in phoenix for a week best meal i had this trip n nthis place is walking distance from all the big hotels in downtown phoenix in a safe neighborhood no taxis needed each time i ve been here the food has been lick the plate of every drop amazing the cocktails are also great the service can be slow but i haven t found the service to be bad i m headed there again this week i wish there was a touch more elbow room in the restaurant but that s about it i went to breadfruit a few months ago and waited until now to post it to keep myself from saying anything too mean i went with my boyfriend and had the worst service nthe server kept just wandering back and forth between the kitchen and dining room without doing anything we had to try several times every time we wanted to get his attention also a note on the menu i am extremely pick i know this so i try to keep it in perspective i have been a vegetarian since i was and do not like meat at all i ordered the tofu but when it came out it looked more like chicken and the texture was like chicken i asked my boyfriend to try a piece and he thought it was chicken as well after several attempts we got the server s attention and asked him if he was sure they made tofu and not chicken by mistake this is where our serves becomes unbelievable the guy actually yells at me that it is not chicken it is tempeh not chicken tempeh is a soy product but is not tofu it should not be listed as tofu on the menu if it had been listed correctly on the menu i would not have ordered it because i already know i do not like it ni did not know how to react i ended up just eating the rice and the server ignored us the rest of the meal he came back to pick up the plates noticing i did not eat it and didn t say a word or offer to take it off the bill it then took us another minutes at least to get him to pick up the bill i will never go back here two words the worst i just came back from jamaica a few weeks ago and i had a crving for some real jamaican food seafood over cooked way over priced and i guess you have to drink alcohol to get good service i wish i would ve checked yelp first i went here on a recommendation my bad won t happen again they have some of the best cocktails in town ask for bryan the bar manager and he ll pick your poison some of the best drinks i ve ever had more rum than you could ever imagine do the drink courses staff and atmosphere are superb i only sit at the bar so i can watch the bartender masters create the awesomeness that are their drinks food was superb but i go there for the drinks and atmosphere a girlfriend of mine brought me to this really cool place the ambiance is great a very jamaican feel good music good atmosphere and amazing drinks their bartender bryan is so passionate about his work and makes the absolute best drinks i have ever had you have to make sure that you have him make you a sugar foot or classic mojito a very refreshing smooth delicious drink he will not disappoint you bryan thanks for making it impossible to have a regular beverage now i crave your drinks and have been back multiple times just for them keep mixing those wonderful beverages i had the opportunity to visit breadfruit in the company of a good group of friends who were all willing to share bites of the dishes they ordered i brought a bottle of champagne to share and it seemed all of my friends brought bottles of liquid treasures themselves we had so much to drink that the champagne didn t get opened with a reasonable corkage fee of it was easy to bring a ton of wine n nfor an appetizer we shared the plantain avocado spring rolls they were so so nothing overly impressive to me i was actually wishing for a spicy sauce to dip them in for my entree i had the brown stew chicken dish it s a marinated and sauteed chicken dish served with rice with peas and some steamed veggies again no spice with the dish i actually asked for some hot sauce to go with the dish despite the lack of heat it was still very flavorful and i enjoyed it n ni would like to give breadfruit another try i think their simple menu lends for getting a dish just right and making it well i look forward to trying their other menu items this is a review of the bar only i ll review the food another time the thing is the bar is the star here we return to this little gem again and again because the craft cocktails are hands down the best in phoenix n nevery drink on the menu is hand crafted with the utmost gourmet style and fresh house made impeccably sourced ingredients n nthe bar staff is faultlessly trained and knowledgeable not to mention friendly and welcoming if you re lucky you ll get to witness a training session the owner imparts the history of rum from all over the world to his team he knows every nuance from how they are made and aged to how to pair them in ways your palate has never experienced n nit s a flavor adventure no matter what you order but try the rum old fashioned it s the best we ve ever had honorable mention to the piña colada it s absolutely outstanding not too sweet like most others you ve had and the real coconut both in the mix and as a garnish makes it transcendent n non a cool evening try the from scratch hot buttered rum it s so rich luscious and complex you ll be transported to an island paradise breadfruit is a restaurant that always tries their best the staff is always friendly they do a wonderful job of serving what is in season when they have a seasonal drink available you should try it you will not be let down the jerk dishes are spicy but delicous if you haven t had the escovich patties they are amazing on fridays and saturdays there can be a wait especially for groups i wanted so much to love this place but it just didn t happen for me i think upon entrance of the restaurant and less than warm greeting mind you they weren t even busy i was like sigh n nwe had the rum glazed prawns and roti flatbread which was the tastiest of our selections we then had the plantains and chutney dip escovitch fish and festival entire whole snapper and i had some sort of soup i wanted more flavor more authenticity everything was just okay and for the price i would have expected more everything about this restaurant was incredibly the servers were great the rum drink was out of this world i had an appetizer and then the salmon the whole meal was fantastic little bit on the expensive side but it was well worth it if i could give this place zero stars i would but since i have to give a minimum of one the only plus in this place was the food i ve been in the restaurant industry for years and this is by far one of the strangest experiences i ve ever had n nmy beautiful bride and i walk in and ask for a table for two when they open bartender says do you have reservations not one person in the place host says next time please try to get reservations minutes later still the only ones in the restaurant n none of the waitresses tried to bring something behind the bar and i actually heard the bartender yell at her to get it out from behind the bar n nour server came over to take our order when my wife ordered the salmon she wanted the sauce on the side the server said no i asked why she couldn t have it on the side she said because there are no substitutions as you can read at the bottom of the menu n ni can honestly say again that i ve never experienced anything like this in my life we will never be going back stumbled upon this place a while back and was pleasantly surprised it s a small clean place that seemed a bit unassuming but friends and i decided to stop in boy i m glad we did the carrot juice was great always love a place that offers ginger beer and the brown chicken stew was sooooo good wish i had room for dessert but i was pretty stuffed by the end n none thing i don t recommend is the plantain and avocado spring rolls it just becomes a strange flavorless mush in your mouth but don t let that dissuade you from trying this place out because then you d be missing out we went on a friday night without a reservation and had a less than minute wait it s a very nice and cute spot and the vibe is fun and eclectic we got seated but ended up having to call another waiter to see where our waiter was in the midst of good conversation we did not realize that no one had come to the table to get our drink order for or so minutes n ndrinks were ordered and were absolutely amazing my colleague liked her salmon dish and i ordered the jerk chicken it was very good and flavorful but the rice and beans turned it all off for me the rice was super dry which made the dish harder to eat i ve had better jamaican food so if you try jerk chicken here and aren t pleased try it again somewhere else perhaps more authentic my girl and i have eaten here for years despite the little negativities here and there they won tnlet you order to go food waiters reluctant to bring table salt etc nwe decided to eat there about a week and a half ago when we arrived it was about an hour prior to closing there were tables open on the patio when we asked about sitting on the patio the host literally grimaced then explained that there wasn t seating for two on the patio nan hour before you close multiple tables open outside on a thursday night really nso rather than dignifying the hosts response with an oh okay i said thanks we ll check back then finished that sentence to my gf with when hell freezes over n nso nwe actually walked right around the corner to pomo pizzeria and were served a world class meal had an awesome server were greeted by the chef himself because he brought us a complimentary dessert nall without ever hearing a word about how the breadfruit employ treated us earlier n nlast nwe drove past the breadfruit on our way and saw that the open tables were now guess they don t care about our silly top but hey nkeep up that rep guys went to the breadfruit for lunch today and am sad i ve never been here before it was so delicious my both my meal and my wife s was to die for the atmosphere is also really nice with some good reggae playing and the service was excellent i will definitely be going back for more the food is fine and the drinks are excellent but the restauarant s policy towards small parties is not acceptable my wife and i frequently dine out and am are very disappointed when the restaurant staff seats small parties at the worst tables breadfruit is quilty of this the last time we were there we refuse the table offered and requested another table that was empty but the staff indicated that was saved for a larger party later in the evening one last chance for breadfruit we called for a reservation for a specific table but were told that table is only for larger parties not for diners that would be okay if some of the smaller tables were placed in better locations in the restaurant we decided to take our business to other restaurants that appreciate their customers i recently went to my first first friday and my first trip to downtown phoenix after a few hours at the phoenix art museum friends and i hopped on the light rail and tried a new restaurant enter the breadfruit n neasy to find sign on the street corner on a charming and quiet little street sits the breadfruit with a hostess standing out front greeting guests you can see the very intimate seating area from the street and it was packed a good thing for pm on a friday night we sat and waited outside at the cute little tables way too hot to eat a full meal outside we were offered menus to peruse while we waited about minutes for a table n ninside we ordered two mixed drinks a mojito vanilla for me they were strong and very good the mojito was very minty and refreshing and my mojito loving friend said he should have ordered a mojito read get a mojito n nthe food we split a tilapia patty very spicy for an appetizer patties are jamaican empanadas ni had the coconut curried tofu with rice and peas ripe plantains and veggies this is the one of the best tofu dishes i have ever had my only complaint is that breadfruit needs to have more plantains per plate they are so good none friend had the curried chicken and dumpling with a green banana veggies plantains and a side order of rice and peas although he didn t like the whole wheat dumpling he loved the curry sauce and the green banana he called the sauce delectable n noverall this is a great place small but great the drinks are strong the food is great and the serve is prompt our only regrets are not enough plantains and we should have gotten dessert let me tell ya breadfuit has really got my goat no really they offer a local mountain goat dish on their menu offering meats and produce from local or at least from sustainable farms this snug retreat has you loungin you in da island mon n narriving in a sand colored seemingly residential area i was surprised to see the glowing rum sign eureka i was in the right place nautical ropes lead you to the front door opening on the lounge area and impressive rum collection over varieties in fact cozying up in the corner to get a good shot for you lovely yelpers and someone possibly staff proceeded to ignore my positioning and squashed me between the door and the brick wall eiy after i got over my self importance i complimented the rum punch bowl and followed our waiter ryan to our table pour duo at pm on a wednesday night we were two of five people in the joint which is good because it s a pretty small space n nsetting to the menu i had to hold back my surprise the prices before me were a bit higher than the online menu nonetheless i knew what my order was destined to be the blue mountain curried goat with farm veg blue mountain curry marinade and basmati rice when do you get that opportunity in new england the dish was flavorful sweet and spicy and plate licking good and plentiful but i doubt that you d be able to resist the temptation to scoop up every last bite n nnot into goat how about rum the cocktail menu is just how i like it in courses each concoction offers freshly squeezed juices tonic made in house like soda stream aaaaand massive blocks of ice sucks up a lot of space in the glass but at least you don t have to worry about ice chip avalanche when you re going for the last drops of your bev the nfifth company a ginger brew raspberry bergamot essence mt gay eclipse rum off the cuff i was unimpressed for maybe oz of cocktail that s steep even for boston standards but sipped over the course of the evening i found it to be a pleasant surprise of a beverage sweet tangy zippy sips totally worth it n nfull from the goat i almost passed up on dessert thank goodness my dining partner talked me out of that mistake we ordered the jamaican puddin pie no g with rum infused whipped cream it was a small sliver of a slice but the custard like pie was sweet and filling can i take a tub of that whip to go all in all a great dinner albeit a pricey one about for two with an excellent cocktail the lounge space is large enough to prevent crowding yet small enough to create that warm intimate feel that warms you right up a great choice for a private party or a relaxed semi casual first date if you can find the place order up the mollasses fried lollipops chicken lollies and let me know how they are great place amazing cocktails good food and nice atmosphere my fiance had the goat which was awesome i ordered the lobster which was a little disappointing small portion and a tad fishy but overall definitely a place worth checking out if you re in the phoenix area what a great little find this place is amazing so many different selections for rum the bartenders were really great and friendly they explained the techniques behind some of the popular drinks and how they made a lot of their own tinctures for drinks they have an outdoor patio in the back for smoking cigars which i think that is pretty great we didn t try the food while we were there but they just rolled out with their new menu for summer i will be back the breadfruit is a caribbean themed restaurant in downtown phoenix that one of the members of our group recommended us to check out since they had been here before n nit is a chill spot and very cool looking inside they also have a cool back patio that you can hang out in as well i loved the look and feel of this place but personally i am not a fan of super spicy hot tasting foods so i only ate several of them scallops the divers scallops themselves were cooked perfectly but my mouth was literally en fuego it seems like nearly all the food items here were hot spicy so this restaurant lounge was just not a good fit for me i didn t try the jerk chicken but the girls in the group complained it was dry but a few of the guys seemed to enjoy it n nthe staff here was awesome though our server rocked the house and made sure we were well taken care of they do offer quite unique cocktails and they try to incorporate rum spiced into many of their drinks so i tried a mojito to play it safe and it was good n nif you like spicy hot tasting caribbean food drinks this may be your spot unfortunately i do not so i probably will not be back the food drinks were reasonably priced because most of them cocktails and foods consisted of high quality ingredients went to breadfruit a few weeks ago and it was delicious they have a few vegetarian options that are quite good i ll need to return to update this review but believe me please you will like this small ish restaurant with big food goodness the staff is extremely friendly and helpful and you will not be disappointed will update soon excellent establishment the breadfruit rum bar is a very unexpected gem for the phoenix area i truly didn t expect much of a caribbean restaurant in the area the restaurant offers a great sampling of high end jamaican dining along with a rum selection that is unique eclectic and satisfying the staff was extremely attentive perfectly told the story of the establishment s focus and provided both drinks and food that were exquisite highly recommended this is my very favorite little spot in phoenix my first visit the daily rum punch was blood oranges passion fruit and rum infused with baby grapefruit leaves are you kidding it was awesome and just a small example of the up and beyond level of passion invested in everything they do true the daily punch and the seared scallops with rum reduction hot buttered rum and plantains are simply must haves and regardless of your other selections you will find yourself saying omg to everything you put into your mouth breadfruit is a little jewel and exactly that hole in the wall kind of place with incredible food we search high and low for enjoy decent food flavors were good for phx but if you are looking to relive and experience you had in jamaica you are not going to find it here good execution lack of the really bold jerk flavors that you come to love while in jamaica would i come back maybe absolutely wonderful early evening meal with wonderful service carrot juice was perfect compliment to the meal festivals was perfect had the brown stew chicken and the flavors were just right spicy shared the slaw and all of the flavors so complimented each other the rice was generous and tasty and did not sit heavy at the end of the meal the ginger sweet potato pudding was wonderful no heavy sugar taste just plain comfort food the entire meal was like sitting down at the table of the chef s family i will definitely return get the rum flight everything after that won t matter very quaint romantic spot with great locally sourced food have a good cigar selection highly recommended in phoenix for a few nights and checked this place out started with a drink that was recommended by the server i believe the name of it had the word punch in it would definitely recommend it if you are looking for something that is not too sweet atmosphere is great for a date night but considering we had an infant with us i would leave the kiddies at home i know that may be common sense but since we are out of towners our little one had to come tried the avocado and plantains appetizer which was very unique who would think to add these two items together brilliant my husband tried the jerk pulled pork and if you like food with a kick i would try something different and give this a try as it will give you a kick ended my meal with a butter drink of some sort which was dessert in liquid form a creamy liqueur drink but well work it left off the sweet potato pudding dessert which also was unique and quite delicious all these items were recommended by the server so a for the recommendations and listening to my likes in order to find the perfect matches from the menu great date night restaurant and i would recommend sitting outside on a nice warm evening breadfruit is in a small non descript building a block from asu downtown if you weren t heading in that direction with the specific intention of going to breadfruit you d never know it existed n nit s a tiny place probably seating at the absolute max so i see how it could get packed with a quick influx of people on this particular lunch outing around the noon hour i was one of five diners and still it took nearly minutes to get my food so don t expect a quick lunch in between business meetings this place is too laid back for that but the service was tremendously friendly n ni got the jerk chicken and it was very well spiced thankfully not overpowering like i ve had elsewhere it was a nice hefty sized chicken breast and was very succulent not dry at all like others have suggested perhaps other reviewers aren t familiar with traditional dry rub jerk i do wish there was more chutney though as it was delicious the corn pineapple and slaw were all a bit flavorless n nthe highlight of the meal by far was the carrot juice which was like drinking a big slice of frosted carrot cake and offset the spicy jerk chicken nicely n ni m sure i ll go again at some point to try some of the other items but i m not into it as a lunch place even though it s close to where i work i can get a quicker and just as filling lunch elsewhere for cheaper not that a jerk chicken entree and carrot juice is that expensive i haven t had many experiences in jamaican dining but if this is what it always tastes like then i think i m adding jamaican cuisine to my list of likes nestled on a side street in downtown phoenix the breadfruit could just as easily be nestled in a corner of a beach village just waiting for diners to experience an intimate meal the vibe here is definitely like that of a beach town everything is calm cool and collected the dining room is tiny and if you plan on coming with more than just one person i definitely suggest calling ahead it s cozy with dim lighting and perfect for a date night n nmoving on to the food those who can t handle a kick of spice to their cuisine should be warned the menu doesn t lie when it says that the food is spicy but if you can handle a major kick the food is worth it to start i tried the mussels i m not typically a mussel fan but these were an exception they had a jamaican kick to them and the servings were generous in size for my meal i had the jerk shrimp and holy moly did they have a jerk of spice to them the shrimp came with pineapple and this long piece of plantain type bread and i ordered a side of rice the meal was delicious n nnow be warned the pricing here isn t cheap however i am not letting that take away from the fact that the food was delicious the atmosphere was wonderful and the cocktails made of fresh fruit and delicious rum were supreme i will definitely come back and this time i ll take a cab so i can continue my post dinner cocktailing at rumbar next door came for a rum cocktail and was not disappointed i like to try new flavors so ordered the alchemist with sage saffron myrhh tincture n bayleaf mmmm sat at the bar and it was such a treat to watch our bartender craft these exotic cocktails one after the other however i can only speak for the drinks as i didn t try the food first time at this place following a recommendation interesting vibe at this place little uptight for me we were the first in the door at we were asked about our reservation yes we had one we were asked to sit in the waiting area what you just opened then we were asked by the next person if we had a reservation finally we made it to the table we were the only ones there strange greeting obviously being a rum bar drink options were very limited interestingly enough no iced tea option i don t think i have ever been to a restaurant that doesn t have tea the sollera was quite tasty but not quite the same as tea apps were really good scallops and plantains would do both of these again they will not alter or substitute any of the menu options tread lightly if you have food allergies entrees were also quite good pork belly was fantastic pork with polenta was also good spicy could not get dessert as both options had dairy and gluten overall food was very good the environment and service approach is a bit stuffy for my taste i would have thought the vibe at a jamaican restaurant would be a bit more easy going and friendly not the way it is here it s been awhile since i ve been to the breadfruit and i d heard about their new bar next door so my girlfriend and i gave this place a whirl after dinner down the street really nice little neighborhood bar not a big space mind you as there is bar seating and a few small couches but a nice intimate setting with cool lighting exposed red brick and a nice color and lighting scheme to setup a very laid back atmosphere and there s plenty of overflow space into the breadfruit next door they just updated their drink menu so the waiter wasn t completely up to speed on the latest menu items but we took a shot at couple of the old school favorites among them is the punch bowl special which is not surprisingly a punch bowl the bartender mixes in with different rums on a nightly basis good stuff we also got a mr smith and a tamarind ball some of their drinks are a little on the pricey side but we weren t disappointed with any of them note if you re super ambitious they have a drink on the menu that retails for per pour we had a great view of the bar and the multitudes of rum and other unique alcoholic concoctions on the wall and felt perfectly at home with the friendly staff great addition to the neighborhood and topped off the night perfectly appetizers overpriced small portions nentrees good flavor nservice lacking n nthe server who had our table was awkward she was nice enough but didn t really understand service my friend asked for a cocktail twice and on the first occasion they said they couldnt make anything with grapefruit juice and on the second occasion he ordered a pina colada and specified a type of rum n nshe came back and said the bartender wouldnt make it because the flavor would comprimise the integrity of the flavor he wanted brazilian rum in a pina colada big deal just make the drink don t make him feel bad n nwe felt rushed as our plates were cleared before our friends were finished eating n nthe food was tasty however i won t be back due to the strange vibe i got absolutely amazing food incredibly intimate atmosphere the music is low enough to hear your date it s incredibly quiet and dark perfect place for a date the menu is a little pricey so come ready to drop at least on a table of two if you have alcohol the rum selection is amazing they only have beers and a similarly abysmal wine list but it s a rum bar and they do rum better than any other place in phoenix the mojito is strong yet tasty and the sheer number of different cocktails is startling the wait staff is incredibly nice and knowledgeable about they re menu they have a catch of the day plate when i went it was salmon and it was probably the best salmon i ve ever had overall breadfruit is an absolutely perfect date night restaurant i will definitely be back first friday for july this place is packed think of a sardine can packed little room to walk around from bar to seat and no room to breathe as soon as breadfruit has the money they need to expand the space good drinks are a total loss in such a tiny space oh and you cannot take your drink outside and sit at the cafe table i do not think their liquor license allows that minus one star for the cramped space n nthe drinks are fantastic they are strong flavorful bold drinks your heart may skip a beat at the prices the rum drinks are all the beer is and the wine is glass but the drink is worth the money my one mojito vanilla made me intoxicated yes i am a light weight but i usually need drinks to do the trick seriously five star drinks n nthe mojitos are fan tas tic wonderful delicious the matuselum platino rum used in the mojitos is smooth and tasty the muddled mint is powerful but it does not overpower the drink it is a perfect balance n nmy review should honestly be two lines good strong delicious pricey drinks that you should enjoy and tiny cramped space not good for large parties or too many patrons bleh i m sorry breadfruit but i will not be back i was really excited to try this place when we heard it was opening i ve said before that i don t like mexican spicy but i do like asian spicy i forgot to add that i also like caribbean spicy finally a place in downtown to get some good caribbean jamaican food boy was i wrong n nwe met a couple friends here and when we walked in i loved the decor it looks just like the inside of my house with the bright colored walls and the exposed brick and ductwork unfortunately my love for this place stops there we decided to order the plaintain avocado spring rolls taste wise these were okay on the first bite the more you ate the less distinguishable the flavors got it was really just a big mess of mush inside a soggy wonton type wrapper the dipping sauce was tasty though n ni ordered the jerk shrimp and it came with a side of rice and beans the tails were removed from the shrimp which was really nice to not have to take care of myself unfortunately the shrimp were not cooked very well they were quite tough and had this weird crispiness to them the flavor on the shrimp was ridiculously overpowering i know i am a bit of a wimp when it comes to heat and spice but this was too much i couldn t taste anything besides the spice even after downing my entire bottle of pineapple soda which was way too sugary everyone else s food looked decent but overcooked one dish the stew looked like baby diarrhea honestly the highlight of the meal was the little breadstick thing they serve alongside the food it was pretty good n nsorry breadfruit i will continue to pass by you in favor of better restaurants like the turf i went to lunch at the breadfruit it was around pm when my lunch date and i entered the tiny but warm restaurant we had the place to ourselves our waitress was great right away she explained the menu and sold us on a couple of mocktails i had the carrot juice and my date had the kiwi pineapple quencha the carrot juice had coconut milk nutmeg and vanilla mixed in it was tasty i love anything with coconut milk even carrot juice my guest s drink had kiwi and pineapple nectar and was garnished with a piece of sugar cane my guest gnawed on the sugar cane to give it a whirl she liked her drink too n nwe split a house tropical salad to start the greens and veggies were very crisp and the fruit was juicy the ginger poppy seed vinaigrette was refreshing and i couldn t place the zing to the dressing i asked our waitress and she informed me it was the orange zest i was tasting of course n ni ordered the jerk chicken and my guest ordered the coconut curried tofu the chicken was wonderfully spiced the coleslaw was not wet which i liked much more healthier the roasted corn had a hint of something else maybe coconut the corn just had a nice flavor i haven t enjoyed corn on the cob that much in a long time i saved the grilled pineapple for last and it was worth the wait my date s tofu was excellent it was like tender pieces of meat again with the coconut she let me have a taste yum n ni am glad i finally made it to the breadfruit i knew it was there just never got around to it i am glad i went i will be back and i will add it to my lunch rotation i found this restaurant on vegan restaurant locator so i had expectations of many things to select from as was described on the site in reality there was one entree on the menu or you could put together some sides to keep it vegan it s a nice place but they probably shouldn t be listed on a vegetarian vegan friendly website the description there is misleading that being said the food was excellent and the atmosphere charming it s a little upscale so we felt a bit uncomfortable in our t shirts and jeans and the look on the host s face confirmed it if we go again we will dress a bit nicer and will know what to expect on the menu this restaurant is an absolute gem of the arts district down town my husband and i rode the light rail with our bikes in tow when we found breadfruit what an excellent choice craig our server was fantastic and helped us pick out the perfect dinner and drinks we ordered the fish of the day red snapper prepared with their custom seasoning and their house salad with a red strip and their signature jamaican mojito we were in food heaven and just when i thought it couldn t get any better we ordered a chocolate souffle and ice cream for dessert everything was just perfect the fish was the best we had ever had the drinks were exceptional the atmosphere was great for our date night and the service was on par we loved our experience and highly recommend you check it out what a great place i love this place i absolutely love it great food great drinks really cool vibe i am an az native and love eating down town this is the first place i think of when trying to come up with something fun and delicious that everyone will enjoy be prepared for some good spicy caribbean food excited about my first dining experience today at the breadfruit at e pierce st downtown phoenix learned about the establishment while researching suggested restaurants from my companies vendor for a large group coming to town in march was told at pm that there was a two hour wait and that it s best to make a reservation before dining well of course i was not going to wait two hours to eat dinner so we left then it hit me the white couple in front of us that arrived at the same time wasn t leaving nor did they have reservations why were they staying and we weren t so at pm i called the restaurant from my car to make a pm reservation the same person dwayne who said he was the owner told me he could accommodate us at pm definitely not two hours maybe my voice didn t sound black like my face looked what a huge let down i will do my best to spread the word about my unfortunate experience at breadfruit breadfruit is a refreshing restaurant for anyone in search of delicious fresh and filling food i have tried numerous appetizers and each have been wonderful i particularly like the patties the flaky crust is perfect as for entrees i love that they have some inventive and creative vegetarian and vegan options the curry tofu is my favorite however the pop cho is also tasty as for beverages the carrot juice or the coconut water are good but i am docking them a star as soon i will no longer be able to byob here hopefully when they get their liquor license they will have great wines so i can update my post everyone must finish their meal with the breadfruit s own homeade vanilla ice cream and sweet potato pudding it is melt in your mouth good if they sold the vanilla ice cream in pints i would stock it in my freezer and probably turn into a vanilla ice cream addict breadfruit is simply wonderful while shopping at the farmer s market downtown one saturday someone handed us a little square sample of something so delicious we went back for another bite it was the sweet potato bread pudding served at breadfruit and knew this was a restaurant we had to try nwe went for dinner on a weeknight and were immediately greeted by a friendly and knowledgeable server the restaurant is inviting and cozy lit with candles and open kitchen polished concrete floors a brick wall and bright green accents nthe waiter who was attentive without hovering recommended an appetizer on special that night and it was fantastic it had heat but it was the flavors that came through we ordered rice to go with at the server s recommendation and were glad we did as it gave something to soak up that leftover sauce fantastic my husband order another special for his entree oxtail rice and chard it was delicious but the hit of the night was a staple entree jerk chicken again plenty of heat but the flavors were doing a reggae in my mouth we ended our meal with rich coffee made in the french press and the dessert that had lured us there in the first place sweet potato bread pudding the menu isn t extensive but what we had was exquisitely prepared and the specials added variety it s also vegetarian friendly we will definitely be back i go back and forth on this place sometimes its great sometimes i feel its over done and not really worth it n nsomeone marked that it wasn t ahmazing and i tend to agree but in a city that has far too many pizza and burger and southwest places its nice to have a change of pace the food is well priced n nits not my go to but i enjoy it and i d highly recommend going if you want something different and never been one of my favorite places to get drinks they have a different daily punch and some really inventive rum cocktails not what you expect appetizers overpriced small portions nentrees good flavor nservice lacking n nthe server who had our table was awkward she was nice enough but didn t really understand service my friend asked for a cocktail twice and on the first occasion they said they couldnt make anything with grapefruit juice and on the second occasion he ordered a pina colada and specified a type of rum n nshe came back and said the bartender wouldnt make it because the flavor would comprimise the integrity of the flavor he wanted brazilian rum in a pina colada big deal just make the drink don t make him feel bad n nwe felt rushed as our plates were cleared before our friends were finished eating n nthe food was tasty however i won t be back due to the strange vibe i got it has been a while since we ve tried somewhere new in downtown in all honesty it is difficult to try new places when all of the new places are only open for lunch and i don t get home until pm that is why we were pleased to see a new place right down the street opening up and actually staying open until n nthe breadfruit is the work of dwayne allen as far as i can tell he is a nobody in the restaurant scene which is a nice change of pace for some of the places that are going in downtown the space is quite inviting small open lofty area for dining with seating for about people inside bright green walls and faux brick interior brightened the area up and contrasted the exposed ducts i felt like i was at home there were two tables set up outside as well providing an inviting option in the cooler months but the local foot traffic was a little sketch n nthe menu is different there are words that you recognize surrounded by words that you don t making ordering a bit difficult most likely you will go with the word you know and order based on that my party seemed to have done just that n nafter a lengthy wait to place and receive our order our table was full of food n nplantain avocado spring roll with seasonal chutney this overpriced appetizer was a terrible mess of mushy vegetables warmed inside a pastry and layered with mashed mandarin oranges the group enjoyed i was less than impressed and greatly disgusted at the contrast of hot and cold on the plate n nescovitch fish and festival friend got this she seemed to enjoy it not finding it to be nearly as spicy as it was made out to seem the fish seemed like it was cooked well and the escovitch sause was excellent n nbrown stew chicken friend got this he seemed to find it to be skimpy compared to some of the other dishes the meat was significantly less existent there were also some bones in the chicken n njerk shrimp wife got this she thought it was good but was suffering from the spice she is not one to eat spicy food and this was too hot for her the shrimp were cooked well and had a bit of crisp to them also the tails were removed which earned them big bonus points in my book n njerk chicken off the grill mine if ever a dam breaks and floods downtown phoenix i know that we will be safe the chicken at zoe s cafe and the breadfruit will save our home by absorbing the water i couldn t imagine drier chicken than at zoe s before last night but the jerk flavoring added to the bone dry chicken was the perfect storm to absorb any liquid from my body terrible simply terrible realizing that the chicken wasn t spicy at all by my standards i ordered up some more of that escovitch sauce and drenched by chicken in it whereby making it palatable the chicken was surrounded by an over cooked pineapple slice that was hard and dry a tiny piece of corn that had such small kernels on it that i actually had to use a knife to cut them off something i hate there was also a pile of ital coleslaw which was a combination of sticks and rubbish that traditionally makes it into the bin at most restaurants hard times call for desperate measures n ndrinks did include a wonderful selection of jamaican soda the ginger beer was great but very sugary my wife tells me that the pineapple soda was a little strong and could have been a bit subdued she also complained of the sugaryness of the sodas n nin all breadfruit is a welcome addition to the downtown neighborhood i was not surrounded by dirty hippies with dreadlocks and the owners were good people i would recommend that people try it once but i would never suggest it as a place to go for dinner n nalso keep in mind that the owner will harass you if you leave even slightly negative reviews of his place on yelp breadfruit is the truth n nthis is corroborated by the fact that exhibit a i e the jerk chicken will make you a believer in a deity be it god buddha allah brahman akal purakh zeus or marley n nthe bird is marinated in hot and spicy seasonings and finished to perfection on the grill it remained tender and juicy throughout except for the masterfully charred ends that added a slight smokiness to the entire dish n nbut lets back up a second n nthe space itself is brilliant in its simplicity the walls are lime and slate gray with classy darkwood furniture the glassed walls look out onto the stoic skyline of downtown phoenix and onto the hidden pave of pierce an homage to side street gems that one would find in cities like ny sf and seattle n nit is comfortable and cozy inside with exposure to the cuisine sharks tending the kitchen at all times there is activity but just enough so that you feel the life of the kitchen spill out onto the dining area i love restaurants that pull this off n nfor an app we started with an order of the curry chicken patty it was sensational within the pastry was a harmonious balance of chicken to curry with a noticeable but slight burn throughout two came in an order which must be shared with a partner because two pre meal would fill you up too heavily n nwhen the grilled jerk chicken was presented it was glorious because you find the caribbean influences presented on the dish a white wine vinegar drizzled slaw roasted pineapple and a succulent savory corncob where the chicken is the heart of the meal the corn was the soul paired together i couldn t have been more delighted n nto drink we had the d g spicy ginger beer imported from jamaica erm i typically like ginger beer but this one was branded as spicy and they f ing mean it be careful that you are prepared for spice on spice if you order it looking back i probably should have stuck with water although the ginger beer was rudimentary for palate preservation as you meander through all of the various flavors of this cuisine honestly i cannot wait to go here to grab a guinness a jamaican staple according to zane lamprey or a red stripe the surging spiciness demands a brew that could handle this oral development n noverall i m very pleased breadfruit braved the great menace that is downtown development here s to them gaining credibility as they continue to master their art its not perfect yet but please believe its in the mail and invigorate a local following of foodies and tourists alike to sample some mean caribbean food i was visiting phoenix for a conference and this was a particularly surprising and delicious find ncocktails i don t love rum but all the drinks have rum in them we tried the run lunch changes daily fin co and a rum old fashion all were amazing well balanced and smooth nfood we shared a pepper shrimp appetizer which had some heat but was really delicious and he shrimp were cooked perfectly i got the red stripe curried prawns and my friend got the jerked chicken both were delicious as were the sides but i have to say the curried prawns were surprisingly great the curry definitely tasted of red stripe but the mix of spices paired so well and i want to go back to phoenix just for this i sent several other friends to breadfruit for dinner and they were equally impressed and raved about the food and drinks nthe service atmosphere cleanliness and restrains were all great too our food came out hot drinks were promptly delivered it s a bit snug in the restaurant but that s really the only thing that isn t glowing that i have to say about it and to be honest i didn t even notice it that much because i was so impressed with the food and drinks highly recommend every meal should start with grace and we did what a delightful server and what a delightful place nice ambiance in and out and what an amazing array of rum the girls in our group enjoyed the rum punch of the day while the guys sipped on their jamaican beer our smoked marlin appetizer was a great start tho the amount of toasted bread could have been increased it could have been if we paid extra we all scarfed down our entrees while my catch of the day was gone in no time i was able to taste my husbands red stripe prawns which may be my next choice on our next trip which there will be i do love rum and should review the rum bar separately but both the rum bar and the breadfruit restaurant are equally awesome n ngreat recommendations from the waiter brown stew chicken and jerk chicken are really good really spicy on the jerk chicken but thats somewhat expected and perfect for me i ll take my plantains baked over fried any day so good really great place to go for not so typical food n nthe entire place is quite small in a perfect intimate way their seems to be a lot of pride in the menu environment and service which is rare to see in restaurant employees not to mention a perfect location very walkable to other nearby bars and easy to make a whole night of downtown phoenix went last night after hearing rave reviews everything was spectacular our server christian knew it was our anniversary and took great care of us the food was incredible and the cocktails were top notch the place is beautiful cozy and intimate for a moment i felt like i was not in phoenix which i was grateful for if i were being totally honest i would give this place a star review but my dining companion thought her food was pretty good so i bumped it up a star for her i went here with a friend last night after the yelp event at pbs it was very close by and also close to my the place i m moving into in a couple of weeks so i thought it would be a nice opportunity to give it a try we went in had no wait it was like pm or so and were seated in the tiny dining room the menu had some interesting looking items on it the drink menu looked good too but being that i had been drinking all night at the yelp event i figured i didn t need to pay for a drink i asked the waitress what soup they had and she said they didn t have soup that day and in a tone that was like you idiot i think because the soup says saturday soup or something but i figured if it was on the regular everyday menu and not a specials menu it was probably just a name for the soup maybe it was stupid i don t know so i asked for my second choice the chicken and dumplings oh sorry we re out of that ohhhhhhk so i asked what she would get and she went on and on about the prawns i told her i wasn t into seafood so what did she suggest that was not seafood and she replied have you ever had prawns really not the expected response from a waitress i have had prawns i do not like them or most any seafood and i do not want an inflated check for food that i do not want because your restaurant is out of everything else she then suggested the salad with chicken in it so i got that my friend got the chicken sandwich she said the sandwich was good my salad was terrible we both concurred it was one of the worst salads i have had the dressing tasted like orange rinds and was super sweet and the chicken in it was very spicy which i like but the two flavors together were not complimentary also the salad was drenched in that dressing no eating around it the veggies seemed fresh enough and it looked nice but for it is absolutely not worth it i got a to go box and left it by the light rail so a homeless person could try to eat it although i think they may even leave it behind i m not sure i would come back here hard to judge a restaurant off of one salad but i m leaning toward a no on that one n nps my friend said they have really cute bathrooms so that s a plus my wife and i went there several months ago before they opened the rum bar next door and brought our own wine not sure if they offer byob anymore but the food was delicious and had a nice kick this is not a watered down version of jerk offerings if you like heat and a great relaxed atmosphere you will like breadfruit the jerk shrimp was quite good the lack of depth to the menu is the only down side n nmatt c i was a bit underwhelmed by my experience n ni will start with the good ni was definitely a fan of their drinks they had a wide variety of drinks and their menu was organized so everyone could find something they d like i had the velvet and vinyl which i thought was flavorful and light while others described it as perfume n ni tried their take on an old fashion rum old fashion and they did a great job with that as well i would highly recommend this place if you re just looking for a drink n nthe atmosphere is definitely jamaican but i thought it was way too loud for what seemed like it could be an intimate dining experience n nour server was very friendly but she spilled one of our beverages on the walk over and it took an exceptionally long time to get a replacement i understand spillage as i am a clumsy fool but the remake should have been much quicker n nwe ordered the scallops to start they were delicious but there were two of them definitely don t just order these if you re hungry they had a slight kick n nthe shrimp i literally felt like i had licked hell eating this dish we ended up ordering a side of rice to go along with it so if you re interested in trying this meal which was delicious after you got passed the spice you need to order some rice to soak up the spice n noverall it was a cool spot but it to feel a little more jamaican inside and offer a bit more to their food menu tried for lunch on a tuesday with six we got great service from jason and thought the food was great too jerk chicken and the tofu were spicy and flavorful we would visit again this restaurant came highly recommended however customer service needs much improvement the food was really tasty but the service was less than desirable our server made a point of letting us know that there would be a gratuity added since we were a party larger than that there was no splitting of checks seriously with all of modern technology what is the big deal in splitting the check it s a shame because the food was really good but we will not be coming back due to the poor customer service significant other and i went here back on oct th we had heard great things about this place from friends we trust so we decided to check it out as we were told it is a very quaint place and could lead to wait times to be seated if you go during a busy time luckily we beat the crowd and were able to sit right away the place has a dark cool ambience but looks clean and inviting ni had the sorrell drink it was really good but a bit too strong of a taste for me to go with my dinner we had the plantain avocado spring rolls for an appetizer they were good but a little mushy and not quite as flavorful as i had expected the jerk chicken off the grill was delicious it was one of the most flavorful juiciest tender chicken dinners i ve had and the sides of corn rice and pineapple were perfect nof course i had to try a desert the pudd n a la mode very nice nall in all a great local small business to try out and you ll find that you will probably return when i lived downtown rum bar was my weekly sometimes bi or tri weekly indulgence rum bar is the perfect date spot cozy and romantic with a fantastic reggae soundtrack playing drinks are strong and oh so good my favorite drinks are the pina colada trust me on this one no syrups involved and mojito but i ve definitely sampled most the bar menu if you are a rum connoisseur which i m not the bar is lined with what could easily be bottles of rum nthis is by far my favorite bar in phoenix i love it so much i came for new years nparting words go to rum bar enjoy the patio meditate to some music order some appetizers from breadfruit and kick back with your rum beverage of choice the portions were small cooked scallops were cold jerked chicken salad barely had any chicken in it large plates were brought with tiny servings food was tasty enough but insultingly small portions my bill was high relative to what i received wouldn t go back food was crazy good service was very good too i like the aesthetics as well it is expensive so i wouldn t frequent it too much but i m only in az for the week anyway the breadfruit balances chic dining with sensible everyman prices and simple authentic presentation n nsome dishes are very spicy seasoned w habanero so avoid these if you re adverse to hot spicy n nrum sangria was brilliantly mixed and coffee beans add an extra level to the aroma even still i was left wondering if putting rum in sangria was really necessary the breadfruit s mixed drinks are for people with a particular affinity for rum otherwise do not try them the season pear rum cocktail was way too rum y the ingredients did not pair well i thought n nsea scallop appetizer scallops cooked just right great dish but the pricing doesn t fit my comments above n noverall i applaud the breadfruit for being unique yet unpretentious in a manner true to jamaica n ndinner saturday pm the two of us share two cocktails seasonal pair and rum sangria the sea scallop appetizer and entrees jerk chicken off the grille and curried chicken w dumplings mmmm festivals i wish i could have those sweet breadsticks for breakfast everyday i ve been to breadfruit a handful of times now and evry experience has been positive the waitstaff has been attentive friendly and accommodating the food appeared in a reasonable amount of time and was always tasty i m not a huge fan of soya chunks so i usually end up ordering a bunch of sides and appetizers and dessert which suits me just fine i would also recommend the blue mountain coffee in an individual french press it s so very delicious n n btw on first friday in march also art detour my friends and i were able to get a table after waiting maybe ten minutes once seated the service was prompt and friendly and our food was great enjoyed the bar area and the drinks the food was good however i was disappointed in the portion sizes also i thought there was a limited variety in the menu the strongest statement about the breadfruit can be made be its owner chef he doesn t have any restaurant experience he s just making the traditional jamaican recipes of his grandmother n nand it works n ni took my two vegan friends to the breadfruit on a weeknight and the small restaurant was about half full there are two ikea tables with chairs in the grass in front of the restaurant for al fresco dining n nas we waited for the delicious avocado and plantain spring rolls we had plenty to talk about with our drink orders hibiscus infused tea and the carrot juice pricing seems steep but in all fairness these were beverages worth every penny the breadfruit is byob wine six pack or beer bottle corkage fee but i had forgotten this drunken little detail n nwe asked if there were more vegan options than the two clearly marked entrees and he confirmed that most of the starters sides were vegan too warning the spinach patty contains beef broth in the crust our server returned from the kitchen to let us know n nwe decided to share everything n nthe tofu curry is a nice complete meal served with rice peas beans steamed cabbage and bell pepper and a side of baked plantains the breadfruit has also added a new item pop cho and pickled ginger a sautee of bok choy onions and rice wine vinegar which is served with a memorable jamaican sweet potato mash n nthe side of grilled corn was juicy and sweet with no dead kernels n nthe festivals is not your everyday bread stick and the subtle sweetness had us wondering if vanilla is the only sweetening agent n nduring the meal we all noted the teeny tiny sink in the more than ample bathroom the primary color walls are juxtaposed nicely against exposed brick and the kitchen is open and you can see the duo chefs preparing the food the service was prompt and courteous n nfor dessert we shared the delectable sweet potato pudd n which is acompact wedge of sweet potato ginger nutmeg and raisins baked with coconut flakes on top perhaps it s a bit dry for some tastes but we found it most enough and we battled with forks for the last bite n nat this point one of the chefs came out and asked with a bright warm smile if we were the vegan table she herself she said was a vegan she mentioned that the sweet potato pudd n was the giveaway the breadfruit had at the recent west of western culinary festival held at the phoenix art museum n nher visit was like a second dessert it s always so nice to so the excitement of the chef who has just prepared your food n nthe breadfruit is a strong addition to the downtown culinary scene now bustling on that corner of st and pierce with pastabar sens and the turf accountant i rarely go for jamaican as there are usually no vegan options except peas rice i was lucky enough to find this place via yelp when i was traveling for biz in phx n nhad an awesome lunch the menu clearly marks vegan options the tropical salad had a lovely tart dressing the fresh pineapple was a nice touch the sorrel drink was gingery hibiscus goodness but my entree took the cake an amazing coconut curried tofu it actually was seitan not tofu whatevs n nsimple modern ambiance super friendly attentive waitstaff n nwill definitely go back if i make it to phoenix again we arrived at pm on a friday and asked to sit outside since it was a beautiful night and we would have had to wait a while for inside seating our server was friendly but a little pushy and managed i know it s our fault to up sell everything it s a byob place so we brought beer but couldn t drink it since we were outside so we all ordered a fruit drink including a whole coconut for it s water then fruit nthe appetizers were really small for the price and although the mango avocado spring rolls sound delicious they weren t that tasty i ordered the coconut curry tofu which was great and not spicy the jerk chicken was too spicy for me nour dinner for four came to before tip pretty pricy since we didn t have alcohol we ve been here a few times for dinner never disappointed the last time we went with a party of on a first friday they allowed us to scatter ourselves until an top could be constructed n none of our party was a newcomer to the valley from harlem who was a cruise organizer to jamaica an aficionado in other words he came away impressed with the authenticity and variety rum bar and it s adjacent restaurant the breadfruit is awesome just spectacular jamaican food the scallops were delectable the jerk chicken was delightfully spicy and the cocktails were fantastic service was great too i recommend sitting at the bar you might luck into some free rum tastings like we did lets start with the nay sayers that have placed some reviews on here i am not sure what you saw read or thought you would experience here but i am very confused by them first the caribbean is known for a great many spices and throughout history they have traded them looted for them and perfected them so when you say the jerk chicken lit your mouth on fire i say you re welcome each item we ordered was perfectly seasoned and so well done if it wasn t for the urban atmosphere i would have said i was eating in jamaica we ordered the plantains to start which were amazing it is hard to perfect a plantain in my opinion since they can be bland but these are very tasty the jerk sauce paired with it was amazing and that was just the starter we ordered the prawns and the caribbean jerk salad and the red stripe curried prawns again how do you make a dish from very humble ingredients taste so good first you come here you let the chefs magic happen the prawns were spicy and full of flavor the red beans and rice are an awesome compliment top notch food n nnow the bar okay this is a bar not a beer night followed by shots of some swill this is a bar people there are mixologists that can place tastes on your palate from very precise mix of rums and flavors up on the shelf this is not a vodka bar as one review had so complained it is a rum bar and it does just that amazingly they pull the flavors and complexities of each rum and pour it into a drink of amazing conceptions that very few bars do anymore very well done n nmy only negative was that i wished that it was bigger well but then i don t people need to experience this all on their own being that it is a smaller footprint you will need a reservation it did feel cramped in the corner but it did not detract from the experience for me walking up and in might be a challenge but don t let that stop you from going in amazing great drinks and food i really like the jerk chicken and the spanish gentleman cocktail but know that the chicken is very hot having read many of the reviews that referenced service issues we must have been in a different restaurant we arrived about minutes early and were greeted by the host he asked us to have a seat while he checked to see if our table was ready we were taken to our table another minute and christian one of the best servers i ever had helped us select our drinks after describing how the the menu was written and several of the drinks unique ingredients we had the plantains and mango chutney for an appetizer the red snapper in banana leaves and jet pork for entrees christian made excellent drink suggestions to pair with the entrees she regularly checked with us within just a few minutes of each item arriving what made her so special was her knowledge and genuine enthusiasm for the menu items you could tell she really enjoyed her job we finished the evening with the rum cake and a perfect cup of coffee we cannot wait to go back i really enjoyed breadfruit i had a mixed drink called mule something with ginger beer in it and it was great the dining area is small only tables and is relaxing without a crowded feel i felt like i was in a jamaican house and the food was being prepared by the mom down the street this is not real jamaican food made reservations for pm had to wait for pm on the dot to get a table informed owner it was my husband s bday celebration no acknowledgement what so ever drinks are okay not worth the check i recommend to go back to the island and do some tasting don t spend your money here so delicious we had the jerk chicken and the shrimp salad it was delightful the drinks are amazing too great atmosphere i have tried rum in the past wasn t impressed tonight i had an amazing experience at thebreadfruit with my hubby the drinks and food were memorable and beyond flavorful so amazingly good i ate very slow to savor every bite wellbeback cheap fresh flavorful nthat s the important stuff n ni love trying new things and breadfruit did not disappoint i was a big fan of the jerk chicken grilled plantains and fruity juices n npros small cute setting byob plate every dish had a couple of sides that came with n ncons street parking service can be a bit slow cute lil spot downtown phx we sat on the patio the waiter was very good and knowledgeable abt every thing on the menu everything he suggested he sold us on the cocktails were top notch we shared apps spicy shrimp and plantains delicious jerk chicken was awesome only thing i wish they had were oxtails that woulda put this place at stars further reinforcing my negative review i just received a message from this business that consisted of a one word name calling insult what better method to ensure that i will go out of my way to continue to warn people away from this poorly managed dump good job we ate here last night before a show at crescent ballroom we arrived a bit before pm and were a party of we weren t the largest party there and definitely got there before a couple of the larger parties n nwe didn t get our food until a quarter after after watching the larger parties that were seated after us receive thiers i asked our server to bring us some to go boxes when she brought the food out as well as the check as we didn t want to miss the show we planned to watch and we didn t receive it for another minutes i m tempted to say that our server didn t place our order immediately or was too occupied with the trainee that was following her around to notice that we were in a hurry even after i asked for the check n nthe food wasn t bad but will likely never eat here again and just spend time at the rum bar the best restaurant in phoenix one of the best restaurants in the country the food cocktails and ambiance is unparalleled do not miss this place is tucked away off the main street very near sens which was our destination but this looked tasty and there was no wait so we ventured in n nthe food was decent nothing special in my opinion but not terrible either nthe place is small and cozy with a different vibe n ni had the plantain avocado spring rolls which were way better than my entree but perhaps i didn t order wisely and get the best entree ni had the curried chicken and dumpling and i wouldn t recommend it i wasn t too crazy about the sauce the banana and plantains were the best part of the dish nthe whole wheat dumpling served with my dish was disgusting i couldn t take more than one bite and left it sit on the plate noverall it s not bad for the price but not great enough to make me ever want to return wanted to love this place had a reservation that we showed up on tome for but still waited minutes to be seated the overall space was cramped and our server was attentive and informative there were many selections for drinks and the two we chose were good food looked the part but was under seasoned and quality portion size was out done by price less of a date spot or dinner spot and more of a place to grab a good cocktail on the way to somewhere else probably even a good neighborhood spot but not as much of a destination dining experience as i had hoped been here a couple of times the cocktails apps we ve tried have never disappointed the ambiance is on the romantic side with pleasant lighting music i really enjoyed the scallops i have to say they are the best i ve had in town these are sweet cooked to perfection pillows of grandeur i am all about sharing apps entrees in an effort to eat try more things without out busting out at the seams however here i told my hubs that next time we re pigging out each getting those or at the very least i m getting my own not sharing make a reservation bring some dough the staff is pleasant helpful too give it a go you won t be sorry amazing cocktail program you can tell they have been doing if for a long time not just because it s now a trend food was awesome and very intensely seasoned cute ambiance really felt like i was out of phoenix the whole experience made me feel like i was in the caribbean i ended up here on a saturday afternoon because the place we were going for lunch was a long wait and walking back to the car we saw the sign which worked out perfectly n ni had never been to a place like this before and the server was super helpful with suggestions i had the avocado salad and it was amazing and really fresh for dessert we shared the sweet potato pudd n with vanilla ice cream at the servers suggestion and it was absolutely delicious i now find myself craving it from time to time n ni liked the atmosphere as there is a small dining area perfect for a party of two there is a very jamaican feel to the decor and it complimented the menu nicely i definitely intend to go back and try out some other sections from the menu and get some more of that pudd n the first thing you need to do when you walk into rumbar and breadfruit is to find brian the bartender who i think is the best bartender in phoenix n nthe shorty drink that they offer is no doubt in my opinion the best drink in phoenix n nbrian is a master craftsman when it comes to truly craft made cocktails n nthe food is always excellent and the scallops should not be missed small plates and entrees are exquisite yet spicy per the jamaican cuisine n nrumbar and breadfruit is no doubt one of my favorite places to enjoy both craft cocktails and excellent food enjoying it i live near the restaurant and have been times since it opened the jerk chicken is very spicy and extremely flavorful the curry chicken had a great taste but needs caution while eating as not only are there bones but there are very small bones the avocado spring rolls are great and the mango that comes with them is kind of addicting the staff is friendly though never very attentive and once mischarged my credit card took days to get it cleared up they also list items on the menu that come with the entree but dont show up when you ask about that item they tell you there is an extra cost for it odd n n for being a unique option to phoenix and for being clean as a whistle we have been wanting to get here but tonight we made it first of all the atmosphere while a bit loud is made up for by the friendly and helpful the server craig so was in heaven with the rum and scotch bonnet martini well there was some other stuff in it but she always wants something spicy in her drink lately and she got it my mojito was great too jerk chicken was so moist and while spicy was not overly salty sweet potato pudd n with ice cream was heavenly overall i will definitely be back for more breadfruit is one of the places that offers eccentric flair and cultural diversity in which phoenix lacks at the moment the decor has this cozy setting and i m a big fanatic of red brick walls was content with the staff and they were courteous nthe food was scrumptious i ordered the rice and peas that was mixed up with coconut milk but however there was a tiny piece of a habanero pepper and my mouth was shooting flames which was unexpected in my dish another dish was the ital soup which is ideal for people who have a cold and a good cleanse after a good workout at the gym i saved the best for the last the vanilla ice cream combined with jello plump raisins and grape nuts cereal had to savour every bite next time i will inform them not to put habanero peppers in my rice dish because that was beyond too hot for me but i will be back to try their other dishes great food and specialty drinks enjoyed the jamaican jerk pork overall nice atmosphere great service unique hand crafted drinks and delicious food i highly recommend giving it a try i have no idea why it took me so long to get to this place such a chill vibe with funky music to talk with a friend or significant other to for hours n nafter eating at sens around the corner which is fab btw my boyfriend took me to rum bar as he d been raving about their drinks for quite some time the bar is separated from the restaurant by a small wall but both are quaint and cozy n nthe drink list hosted many unique offerings we ordered a vanilla mojito and then our favorite a dark stormy ginger beer with gosling s rum oh my god the best mojito i have ever had a little on the sweet side but such a unique flavor with quality vanilla extract in it i can t wait to come back and try the food started off with drinks of course our server was good at providing recommendations on pairing our drink with meal choice my girlfriend had the pina colada warm and soothing while i had the shim sham light and refreshing meal my choice was the curry prawn dish seasoning was amazing my tongue was doing the happy dance house special was my girlfriends dinner choice of jerk chicken wow spicy with amazing flavors overall nice eclectic low key atmosphere with fabulous food and drink highly recommended i found this place on yelp and decided to check it out ni loved that they played island music and the drinks were great server was very nice and knowledgeable of the menu my fiance had the escovish fish which was really good the place is small and intimate so go with someone you like okay so i decided to head to downtown again for the digital downtown contest this time i was walking around the area at a m there s really something to say about watching a city wake up and walking about miles canvasing the streets ultimately though i ve come to the realization that at best i take photos that could cut it as an amateur postcard but generally lack any artistic appeal n nbut something good came out of this breadfruit it was one of the areas in which i was walking and stumbled upon literally i wasn t watching where i was walking and doop there s the curb not uncommon for me being all matiche i peeked in the window because the music was cranked up as i was walking away a lady opened the door and let me know they opened for lunch at noon showed me the menu and suggested the jerk chicken since i d not had jamaican food before it s always delightful to find the owners jamming out outside of operating hours so rob m and i went for lunch n nwe started off with jamaican sodas which were really sweet yet good i had the ginger beer and it s hellavalotta ginger it was way strong rob had the cola champagne which was like cream soda rob ordered the jerk chicken and i ordered the curried chicken and dumpling since the jerk chicken was going to take minutes we started out with a spicy beef pattie and a chicken curry pattie i started with half of the beef and it was good spicy but the chicken was amazing i could mack on those all day long our entrees arrived and we dug in my dish was very flavorful and the recommendation of the server was to eat the dumpling with the sauce good idea since the dumpling itself doesn t have a very defined flavor and it particularly dense if you re thinking granny s chicken and dumplings this isn t it the jerk chicken was so spicy that rob couldn t finish it he did find that eating it with a bite of pineapple helped to cut the heat but it was still hades hot apparently if you order the carrot juice with this dish it counters the atomic heat seriously rob can handle spicy but this was perhaps too much n noverall it was a good experience there were a handful of other diners there at when we arrived and people were coming throughout our meal i m thinking this is probably authentic jamaican cooking and not an americanized version of it i would have liked more salt but i didn t ask because i was in for the authenticity of the meal n nreally stars but i ll bump it up because the setting is nice service was good and it s in a cool neighborhood it s tucked into a residential area not too far from the new asu campus and i liked my meal this will be a place to which we ll return rum bars should be fun this one is not n nupside all the best runs in the world ndownside poor bartenders that only know and are allowed to make the recipes their owner teaches them n nprices are way too high drinks are way too weak n nthe california wine snob bar of rums ew discovered this place at the culinary event devoured i have been craving that fabulous grilled calamari but alas it is not on the current menu the calamari is theoretically going on the spring menu next week narrive at and am told that the restaurant opens at at ish we return and discover that the happy hour pricing is only in the bar but they will make an exception for one drink each and an appetizer so we sit on the deck and enjoy that unbelievable rum punch and a plantain thing we spent a few weeks in jamaica last summer and never encountered punch that wonderful and trust me we tried many nour dishes were equally great the guava glazed pork belly on a bed of bean mash was divine the jerk pork and polenta was spicy and bold and interesting and so very good i am dinging a star for the dingy server she is in another dimension perhaps the jamaican spliff effect nthis is jamaicain american not true hard core where is the calaloo we cant wait to go back we will sit in the lounge and drink rum punches until we are sated and then proceed to the deck for exceptional dining and hopefully the grilled calamari wow wow wow my hubby and i have been wanting to come to breadfruit for a while my hubby has been to jamaica and all over the caribbean kiteboarding so he loves the cuisine we decided to have early dinner since the sitter came earlier this saturday we didn t have a reservation but that was no problem since we usually like to sit at the bar and talk to the bartenders tony and beth were so nice and efficient tony just moved from portland in november so we had a nice conversation with him about the area we spend summers in or i had a mojito wow the best mojito i have had in the valley probably ever my hubby had the caipirinha it was so good we thought we would have one appetizer and leave so we ordered the scallops then the plantain and avocado spring rolls they were so delicious the scallops were spicy it was like fireworks in my mouth in a good way i loved the sweetness of the chutney for my spring rolls my hubby wanted the soup of the day the pumpkin and sweet potato soup i ended up eating most of it since i was dd the hubby had another drink this time the kingston rum punch wow that was strong but tasty tony recommended the rum glazed prawns and roti flatbread double wow my hubby had a pina colada to wash that down that was the best pc i ve had not the blended coco lopez type for dessert we had their bread pudding this was the only thing i was not that crazy about don t get me wrong i still ate it i am just used to the new orleans type of bread pudding more gooey the experience at rum bar was so great we can t wait to come back and bring friends this place is very cute great atmosphere and great staff the food was also delicious my only thing was that it was kind of pricey i couldn t believe i paid over for two small appetizers but i guess that s why this place is doing so well n ni will definitely return again but won t be ordering the appetizer just going straight for their carrot coconut juice which was amazing and their entrees came with a bunch of colleagues while we were in town for a conference the food was delicious but the portions ran a touch small we ordered family style and had to order dishes for women the drinks were amazing the staff were a bit snooty but otherwise helpful and timely finally great vegan food in downtown phoenix n nnot that i m a vegan but still n nthe owners here are really nice and will chat you up about your meal especially if you order something vegetarian the portions are smaller than most people will probably like but hey it s healthy and i ve never left not full just from ordering a plate n nthe menu is also somewhat limited but everything on it is tasty i say this with authority as a guilty omnivore who has plucked food off of friends meat plates also the menu changes a tiny bit from time to time n nif you go you must try the avocado plantain spring rolls seriously if you like fresh locally grown with just the right mix of flavors here s another favorite of mine it just keeps getting better each time i go this well respected establishment takes pride and genuinely cares about the food they are serving n n curried tofu n scallops n patties tilapia n brown stew chicken n carrot juice it s addicting n nthe breadfruit focuses on caribbean dishes in phoenix using locally grown fresh organic produce the restaurant itself is small but they ve expanded by adding a rum bar everything is freshly squeezed and they have the drink of the day for the after dinner cigar smokers there is a cigar bar where you can enjoy your cocktail and smoke your cigar n nthe owner s of this establishment are very friendly and it s almost as if you are dining at their own home everything is cooked to order so you can enjoy a great experience n nchef danielle was just in the az republic as one of the top chef s in arizona give this place an a went in for the first time great atmosphere smells of glorious food in there but what made me write this was the service i got at the bar from mitch lyons he asked what i normally drink and what i expected from a drink so i told him he replied with a simple i got you came back with a piece of art hand crafted beautifully presented drink for the first one didnt think he could top it but made me a second that was even better than the first hands down their best cocktail maker great food amazing drinks beautiful atmosphere my only feedback is the staff seems to be under a lot of pressure to make sure everything is perfect this takes away from the service and from them being personable if they weren t so robotic this place would be stars as i m sure their natural personalities would make this place more inviting we just happened upon the breadfruit today when we were downtown we loved it the bok choy mashed potato dish was delicious especially the sauce on the bok choy and the tofu and rice dish had a great sauce too the best however was the amazing sweet potato pudding with a coconut crust yum the spice level was rather low so even people who don t like spicy food would be fine n nit was a bit expensive for three people and we only ordered two dishes to share but i would definitely go back went here for my birthday dinner cool looking place from the outside kind of small inside and very noisy besides patrons yelling to talk over the noise there s music playing too wouldn t recommend for a romantic dinner all kind of rum drinks so you better like rum beer choices and one red and one white arizona wine wife had the salmon and i had the jerk pork both dishes ok but not memorable only one dessert available and didn t sound that good so didn t order it would go to hula s before this place better food better choice of drinks more food and more reasonably priced probably won t be back this place is excellent the bartender gave me a bunch of recommendations including the pepper shrimp sword fish and sweet potato pie all of which were delicious i d highly recommend this place to eat then hang out in the outdoor patio afterward with the great music the fedora wearing character at the door thought he was too cool for school none of the staff seemed genuine food was nothing to jerk it over get it n nanywhoooooo stars just because i could come back to smoke a cigar on the patio and the rum selection is good as well never tried the food so this is just for the bar part n nrum bar is a must in phoenix the owner is very knowledgable about his subject and will share all kinds of stories about rum and its history in the us if you ask protip ask why he doesn t stock bacardi n nthe cockails are excellent and made with only the best yes they are a little pricey but i ve never had a really good cocktail under so the prices are reasonable considering n njust overall a great experience good service interesting conversation and fantastic cocktails and rum list as a bourbon gal i never knew rum could taste this complex and interesting a definite must go have eaten here three times and each time the food is delicious especially the pulled pork and the jerk shrimp also they akwsys have a special rum drink that totally satisfies when we re in the mood for an island feel service is spot on and friendly parking can be an issue at busy times but worth a try place is pretty good overall i stop going here because it was too pricey and the portions were too small the drinks were great the food was palatable but the service was absolutely terrible and i have never felt so unwelcome in a restaurant in my life n ni took ladies here for my bachelorette party dinner we wanted a low key affair with good food and good drinks and since i was going to jamaica for my honeymoon we figured this was the perfect place we are all working professional women who are accustomed to fine dining and good service but unfortunately we got none of that at the breadfruit n nour waitress tried to push the most expensive thing on the menu multiple times despite my friends saying they don t like seafood she then tried to push everyone to order sides of rice and peas i really wonder if they make a commission from selling rice and peas and also suggested that my friend order some for her year old son my friend went ahead and ordered it because she figured he could nibble on it if he wanted and it wouldn t be a big waste of money if he didn t like it or wasn t hungry more on this later n nanother friend asked the waitress if she could get her meal without anything banana related on the plate because she has a banana aversion the waitress extremely rudely replied the menu says right there that no substitutions are allowed and they aren t bananas they re plantains my friend stated that she couldn t eat either bananas or plantains and that she wasn t asking for a substitution but rather the omission of the plantains from the plate the waitress stated that it could not be done because it would ruin the presentation of the dish so i just piped up and told my friend i would take her plantains off the plate n nnow back to the rice and peas when the year old started eating it he spilled some of it onto the table and then wiped what he had spilled from the table onto the floor he s a year old after all he hadn t made a peep the entire time we were there nor did he ever try to get down from his adult sized chair so pushing some rice onto the floor was not a huge transgression the waitress immediately came over and said in the rudest voice ever oh that s just great can you just not let him do that to which my friend replied don t you have a broom i will clean it up the waitress just rolled her eyes and disappeared but never did bring a broom my friends and i are generous tippers and would have rewarded the waitress greatly for dealing with the aftermath of a toddler s dinner however after the rudeness we had experienced up to this point we couldn t take it any longer we asked the other waiter to speak to a manager and after about minutes during which time our waitress never did reappear the manager finally came over and spoke to us he told us that the waiter would be serving us for the rest of our dinner instead of the waitress but he never did apologize for his employee s rude behavior n ni see from other yelp reviews that others have had similar experiences with that waitress and i question if she is still employed solely based on her scallop and rice and pea upselling abilities it was clear she wanted to do as little work as possible and clear our table as quickly as possible n nif i had only gone for drinks i would definitely go back again but i don t think the food is good enough for me to want to tolerate the utterly crappy service and i know can get good drinks so many other places sorry breadfruit but i will be getting my jamaican food fix elsewhere from now on the vegan jamaican food was embarrassing also guys you need to use salt sorry fantastic hide out near st st and pierce st in downtown phoenix this varribean gem is the real deal i know because i am also caribbean i was very plesently surprise that they srrve the dishes i grew up with but how authentic the flavor was i even found my country s national drink sorrel n ni have been looking for a restaurant that serves caribbean cusine since i move to phoenix amazing food an ample selection of rums try cockspur spice run or mont gay if you wanna try barbadian rum the elegant flawless sophisticated island ambience invutes you to have seat and enjoy at the end of the meal you are presented wuth a post card of a picture of the bar you can either keeo it or write it to anyone in the us and the restaurant will mail it fir you smart marketing i sent mine to my family in tx military discount is also offered n nnot necessary fir the whole family but great foe mmeting friends and date nights i absolutely love this place great spot for a date the atmosphere is off the chain this is the cleanest restaurant in the phoenix metropolitan area a piece home for anyone that understands check them out the food has so much flavor and i can taste the professionalism and skill the service is adult and so attentive yet respectful of personal space and time i come here often the drinks are great also whether you want to keep it simple or fancy it up a bit n ntonight i tried the chilean sea bass if you don t believe me try them out and prove me wrong i don t rate or post much because i m hard to impress this place is impressive they should call this place buttfruit every item on the menu tastes like it has already been digested i found the jerk chicken really only jerked at my wallet and gut after being served i wanted the recipe great if you need your colon cleansed they kill the chickens in the back this place is awesome food and cocktails are great and the staff actually takes pride in what they do this is a gem in dt phoenix incredible is how i d describe our dining experience on our waiter was top notch and asked if we d been there before we hadn t and how we heard about it check please arizona with that information he walked us through the rum menu stating that the left side are custom drinks you ll only get at this restaurant and they re purposely in groups with the top section paired with the appetizer the middle with dinner and the bottom with dessert we decided to try it this way we re very glad we did nmy wife had that day s punch bowl i had the shorty which we paired with the scallops i enjoyed my whole meal but let s just say i will come back for the scallops alone nnext we had the sugarfoot and the sometime in august with dinner my wife s sugarfoot was her favorite drink of the night my drink had a smokey quality to it which made it very unique my wife had the curried dungeness crab salad and i had the jerk pork and polenta the pork was succulent and flavorful with just a mild kick note i like spicy food so some may find the kick more substantial than mild but it was just enough for a pleasant warmth for me i suspect the reviewer who found the scallops oppressively hot would disagree with me nfor dessert my wife had mutiny in the county and i had tradewind swizzle for our drinks both were quite good and definitely sweet dessert drinks hers was very unique due to the irish moss ingredient we shared the chocolate creme brulé this was done because i m not normally a big dessert eater and one or two bites of that will suffice and my wife can eat the rest well this creme brulé is smaller and better than most i could have eaten my own my wife too also enjoy her entire meal but she said she d come back for the dessert alone noverall we had an enjoyable dining experience from beginning to end we ll definitely be back last note make a reservation this is a small restaurant and you will very likely have a bit of a wait if you just drop in i went there for the first time with some friends to try it out the drinks were sub par and the service was horrible the owner flipped the tip we gave him on our face we were shocked to see this sort of behavior for no specified reason i have never written reviews before but i felt that i had to took some friends from northwest scottsdale wanted to show off the convenience of living downtown and walking to restruants had drinks that were excellent with a wide variety of rum recipes service was friendly and very professional we ordered appetizer and entre all great seafood dishes it was fresh and well prepared however the jerk rubbed items were all too hot to enjoy it would get five stars if it was food that was not so hot that you could not taste it parked in front of this place while going to visit the phoenix public market we were pleasantly surprised to find out there were no freezers or microwaves in this restaurant so that tells you right there that you are receiving fresh well prepared food we had to try the jerk plates as it was caribbean food the spice was nice and the food was delicious the only thing that would make us not go back was the small portions for the price but at least you know you are paying for quality they also had blue mountain coffee which was awesome all in all if you have extra money want to taste something different good this is the place great ambiance knowledgable servers not impressed by the menu selection curry goat was tasty curry chicken fell short drinks were a new experience very good tho low lights bright colors and soothing caribbean music sets the mood for a casual dinner at breadfruit this restaurant offers a healthy alternative when eating out i started with the avacado spring roll which comes with a delicious mango chutney and tropical slaw it was nice to see a few vegetarian and vegan options on the menu the black bean coconut rice that came with my curried tofu was delicious service is great and the place is so clean great food great service one of best places in phoenix i highly recommend the jerk chicken and the piña colada this is not a cheap sugar filled drink this is an authentic custom made high quality fresh ingredients and refreshing drink there s no point in making a reservation at breadfruit if they won t honor it or to be more precise they should be less deceptive about taking your reservation in our case we were given the impression that we d have to wait about minutes for our little group on the phone they did tell us that there was another party ahead of us what they didn t tell us was that it would really be more like the minutes times for the four adults and two kiddos when we made our way in the place was half full but four two tops were open and a large table for six was reserved not for us of course and nobody was leaving anytime soon n nwhile we waited a party of two walked in and was seated a few minutes later another two top near them turned over a little forward thinking would have been to seat the two at one of the other open tables and put the other now free tables together it would have been a tight fit but it could have worked n nneedless to say the breadfruit is small there is no waiting area and with the kiddos we weren t going to wait outside in the drizzle we waited in a hallway that lead to the bathroom until we couldn t wait anymore in the end we walked out one star for the cute ambiance but for nothing else this is the second time coming to the breadfruit the first time was just for drinks this time i got the full experience i loved it i was out celebrating my th birthday with my sister we made reservations although it wasn t very busy for a saturday night we went early around pm they open at pm we sat outside at the tables in front the waiter was very knowledgeable in regards to the food and drinks and he gave some really good recommendations i decided on the red strip curried prawns and shim sham as my drink i was recommend both it was very affordable as well the owner stopped by all of the tables which i thought was great made you feel very comfortable they had great caribbean music playing in the background the waiter wasn t overbearing although he did take a little long to pick up my card as we were waiting to leave but they gave me a free slice of pie on the house idk if it was bc it was my birthday or if it was bc my sister use to be their health inspector lol great place definitely recommend it what is there to say about this place that hasn t already been said well first off they need to bring the spicy beef pattie s back seriously n nthe tilapia pattie is fantastic plantain avocado spring rolls are good as well festivals are great as well but save them for a desert n njerk chicken and shrimp its a staple here get it its good spicy so watch your mouth n nescovitch fish can t be beat for a downtown fish dish its runner up for best sleeper dish on the menu n nand the award for best sleeper of the menu n nbrown stew chicken come get some it is a fantastic total dish expect to see an empty plate when you are done the entire dish is delightful n nthe only downer the byob seems a little steep if drinking individual beers but i guess that just means bring a six pack at a time hah wandered in after first friday sat right down no wait and it was soooooo good tiny little place the kitchen smells amazing very affordable given the quality and portions of the food jerk chicken was pretty spicy just how i like it my buddy ordered the scallops and said they were pretty much the best excellent drinks order the coconut water and it is srved in a real coconut that you can scope the meat out of and the two piece musical outfit added great music to chill but definetly not overwhelm cant wait to go back this place is amazing food drinks atmosphere all very good they are a rum exclusive bar restaurant and all of the drinks sound amazing we had the punch bowl special some kind of spiced rum punch and the bourbon masquerade strong in a good way as an appetizer we had the rum glazed prawns and roti flatbread it was sooo good that sauce then for dinner we ordered the escovitch fish festival red snapper and jerk pork and polenta shredded pork over polenta and a side of the roasted plantains mango dip yum yum yum it was all very good but the escovitch fish was by far the best it was very fresh and had almost a sweetness to it like fresh crab i d definitely recommend going there for a nice night out not too fancy but not your average neighborhood grill i m already planning to go back soon awesome patio and knowledgable service amazing rum selection as well the food smelled amazing and i will definitely be back for that in the near future our bartender was very helpful in helping us pick out different rum based cocktails and she was spot on i m a whiskey man myself so she suggested the rum old fashion it was a bit sweeter obviously but excellent flavor overall my wife ordered some concoction with rum and pureed kiwi which i could have seriously slurped down in a few gulps it was so good the drinks are a bit pricey and i think had they been a little less we would have stayed for another round but other than that we will absolutely visit this bar again and again this was my first visit and being located in the heart of the arts district in downtown phoenix was appealing this small and quaint restaurant had great smells of the caribbean cuisine we were seated close to the rum bar area which was neat to watch the bartenders mixing an assortment of rum cocktails the punch rum had a light hint that was unsweet and the lime sugar rum was freshly squeezed lime with rum of course had to have the sweet plantains with mango dip the main meal was some sort of a beef stew with yucca potatoes rolled into a ball the stew sauce was unbelievably tasty ended the night with a cigar and year aged rum this restaurant is too cute a cozy dining room than can fit maybe people and a small adjacent wooden rum bar the food is excellent too there are only a few appetizers and entrees on the menu but what they do they do well just beware that when they say an item is spicy they mean it n nthe roasted plantains with mango chutney were a delicious beginning to our meal i loved my pork belly with guava glaze served over mashed butter beans that were spiked with jamaican spices my friend raved about the prawns simmered in curry and red stripe beer another friend ordered the jerk spiced pulled pork i warned him that it would be spicy and i know he is not a huge fan of spicy food when he didn t finish his meal the item mysteriously failed to appear on the bill was it an omission or did the server realize my friend didn t like it anyway that s not to say the dish wasn t good i think it was just a little too spicy for him n nwe decided not to have dessert here and instead went to the art walk on roosevelt st the breadfruit is a little hard to find and there s only street parking but if you re downtown be sure to give it a try i really love this place i ve been about six times every time is fantastic the food is always outstanding the drinks are top notch i love a restaurant when i feel like they really care about the quality and ingredients you really can t do wrong here womp womp n npros the cocktails really are great and if you re there on a less than busy night the bartenders are very helpful and attentive n ncons the man who seats patrons and takes reservations is made of ice i ve had run ins with him before but the most recent visit has convinced me to stop trying he was very short with our party of two as well as the other small parties before and after us once we were seated no one stopped by for over minutes for anything not water not i ll be right with you nothing it was as if we weren t there at all it was a decent night for them about half full on our side bar there were two other people sitting at the bench by the window at one point two men walked through the bar and attempted to enter the restaurant in order to pass along a message to some friends eating dinner when they were stopped by the host and asked to leave as this is a very small establishment and there is no room for you the men handled it well joking after the server walked away that apparently the place was at critical mass my companion and i waited a few more minutes trying to appear as hungry and thirsty as possible and then eventually gave up and walked out n ni recommend walking around the corner to pomo phoenix s best hidden secret n ndrinks the caipirinha s here are delicious caipirinha is a mojito like brazilian cocktail they have an array of imported rums and rum flight choices nfood i had the ox tail and it was superb a bit spicy but definitely something i would order again nservice our waiter was very knowledgeable about the drink selection and history behind the rums nambiance low lighting romantic n ni drove by this place dozens of times and had no idea what i was missing a friend of mine recommended this place for happy hour i have been back twice since and am a big fan i m in town visiting a friend from texas and we are on a happy hour hunt so we went to the rum bar specifically for that what s interesting is that there is no happy menu the chef chooses plates to serve daily it s kind of a surprise n nfood nwe ordered the jerk pork sliders and pork belly w plantain we were highly satisfied with the pork sliders they had a good flavor and just enough heat however the pork belly w plantain was not to our liking the dish is unique in terms of composition and presentation but it s super small check out the photo and the pork belly consisted of no meat just pure pork belly fat it was disappointing n nto drink we ordered the rum punch bowl special for the day it was amazing full of ginger lemon honey rum etc i generally like drinks on the sweeter side but this was a great balance n nambiance it s casual upscale a good setting for friends or casual business there is nice caribbean music playing in the background it s definitely my style n nservice we sat at the bar there was a new bartender in training which slowed things down a bit but other than that it was great n nif you don t want to eat that s fine but definitely go for a drink try the punch bowl special of the day dear breadfruit n nyou would be worthy of four stars if you were not so utterly overpriced ni will however always take you up on a slice a dat sweet potato pie nand coffee if you insist upon it n n nsincerely nrachel cute little place tucked away on a side street in downtown phx nif you like rum then this is your place and if you don t like rum you might be persuaded i can t remember the number of different kinds of rum they have over for sure nthe rum punch was delicious smoky but fruity they had another drink made with rum and cream soda i really enjoyed as well nthey have a cigar lounge and the patio is nice to enjoy your rum and a nice cigar if you are into that sort of thing nthe restaurant as a whole has a great vibe and ambiance everyone from bartenders to hostess to wait staff were all very friendly and helpful when choosing drinks and food nif you like jamaican food that is the specialty i m not a huge fan the food was good but i just didn t find it to be off the charts fantastic i had the curried goat tasted good but the goat was fatty and chewy my husband had the pork belly big ol hunks of bacon essentially the first hunk was pure fat no meat at all the other slices had a good combo of fat and meat but he was also not entirely impressed our other friends got the jerk chicken which looked really good noverall the drinks are strong and delicious but the food was overpriced and just ok i would definitely come back for drinks though the gap between perception and reality here is amazing great website and beautiful build out of the restaraunt nthe first clue that something was off was that they made us wait to be seated in an almost empty restaraunt it was clear that it was policy that you had to wait no matter what nour waiter had the telltale signs of a current or previous meth addiction he was extremely pushy on upselling he knocked my very expensive sunglasses to the floor and scratched them and thought an appropriate comment was at least they are only plastic nthe food was simply not good mashed potato was not even mashed pork was way over cooked my mojito had endless pieces of mint in it every sip i had to spit out mint the mint was also very old i make a lot of mojitos and you have to leave the mint in the fridge for over a month to look like that nthey claim no microwaves on their website but my mash was only partially warm and clearly not made that day ni ve since read reviews of the place and they apparently look down on chain restaraunts sadly the food and drink does not rise to the level of a well run chain i m no fan of chains but i ve had a lot better meals in strip mall chains than this place nif you like good food stay away if fake it until you make it works for you this place would be number one omg the pina colada i have quite a bit of experience with rum and the pina colada at breadfruit is the most balanced and delicious rum drink i have ever tasted the fresh flavor with just the right amount of sweetness will make you completely rethink your perception of what is typically a sugary frozen concoction served with an umbrella n nvibe was downtown cool with fun jamaican beats playing our service was excellent so as far as the negative service reviews either they have gotten it together or we dined on an on night our server was knowledgeable and made great recommendations even suggesting drink pairings to complement out entrees n nthe scallop appetizer was yummy a little on the small side with scallops so dont plan to share if there are more then at the table the jerk seasoning was yummy and had a great kick i had the prawn curry and really enjoyed the entire dish a generous helping of prawns with sauteed veggies and perfectly cooked rice and peas again many have complained about the rice but it was cooked nicely n nour server suggested a mojito as a paring with the curry and i took her suggestion i get nervous ordering mojitos because some bartenders use mint syrup vs fresh mint which is totally nasty and many tend to over sweeten the drink not the case here again perfect balance between tart and sweet and the best mojito i have had outside of my secret recipe n nfor dessert there was a deep internal struggle between ordering the sweet potato pudding and enjoying another pina colada since i was the driver the puddin won out it was a unique dessert not very sweet and nicely complimented by whipped cream flavored with even more rum i read a few poor reviews for the size of the desserts ok people this is not the claim jumper the size was perfect for sharing and a completely appropriate size for a dessert if you want a ginormus hunk of cake you can go to chilis or claim jumper and enjoy the side of diabetes seriously what is wrong with america soapbox n nall in all an amazing experience and will definitely be back bill was about for of us the food was very reasonable but with cocktails each there was no way we were getting out of there under a hundy that being said the quality flavor and service made it more then worth it wowza we had an amazing time and meal last night n nlet me start off by addressing some of the previous reviews it is a local business so relax on the corporate expectations this place is obviously very proud of their product so if you are expecting food variations manipulation you should go to applebee s their food beverage preparation is a craft and should be experienced as presented n ntheir jerk chicken was out of this world an explosion of taste it is prepared with rice and veggies i like my food spicy and it didn t disappoint n nthis is a must for special occasions small intimate and very clean yes the price points are high you get what you pay for in ambiance quality and experience too often phoenix residents fail to realize that we are one of the cheapest big cities in the nation this place is worth the experience and it separates itself from the norm in downtown phoenix this place is phenomenal was in town for a work conference from ny and decided to give it a try i was in phoenix a few months before and all of my food was terrible so i was weary this place knocks it out of the park it was a little bit but spicy for me could only eat half my jerk chicken because the run was so spicy but it generally enhanced the flavors instead of decimated them also i am not a rum drinker don t like sweet and the sugarcane normally gives me a headache but i had two cocktails here and they both were off the charts be warned the appetizer portions are small but it s fine for an appetizer my jerk chicken and my colleague s salmon entree were plentiful this is a cute little place for dinner and a drink but make reservations i was with a party of four two in the group had been here before we decided to wait the minutes for a table because they said the food was that good even though the yelp ranking was a little low n nthe waitress and a sidekick with a mustache that reminded me of salvador dali s arrived at the table they had that aura about them that made my dining experience entertaining and brings a smile to my face every time i think about their performance n nmy entree was the three stripe shrimp and it was spicy and full of what i would expect to find in a flavorful jamaican dish i also tasted all of the entrees at my table and found none lacking my table also ordered the two desserts that were offered by the waitstaff duo a breadfruit and a chocolate creme brûlée both were very good and worth any health risks from sugar or caloric waste n ntasting all the drinks at my table my favorites were the piña colada and the ginger infused rum drink my lovely waitress suggested that the piña colada would be the best that i have ever tasted and yes it ranks up there particularly since the trips to the rum factory in the caribbean are a little hazy to recall n nso a solid star food and drink experience but the outstanding performance of sophistication from the waitstaff takes this to a star standout there was no spiced rum at all i was shocked that the rum bar had no spiced rum also they only have a handful of drinks on the drink menu and don t make anything else so if you have a favorite rum drink it better be on the menu or you can t get it also prices could be better for what they offer drinks and dessert was dollars which is a little much on the plus side the bartender was very friendly and helpful and did allow me to try some rums to see if i liked them breadfruit filled a vacuum in phoenix by creating authentic jamaican food and drink for a downtown that has suffered from a dearth of interesting restaurants n nwe ate there once several months ago in fact i think it was their first week open for business my girlfriend and i were impressed and did come back even though their tasty veggie meat was out of stock and couldn t make us the veggie meals we came seeking that day n nfast forward to last weekend some friends scored four diamondbacks tickets and i thought since we ll have some drinks at the stadium why not try breadfruit again we could take the light rail and it s only two or three blocks from the light rail station n nwe brought a six pack of red stripe to complete the experience and it was a delight to be back we saw one of the owners who we recognized and liked when we met her but didn t see her partner who is the cook and is jamaican our friends were impressed by the food which held it s own n nwe had fish escovich jerk chicken coconut curry tofu and side orders of plantains all hits everything was cooked to order and impressed our friends the steamed veggies and rice and beans on my plate were delicious and complimented my coconut curry tofu it s actually a little more like seitan their byob policy worked well as we were able to finish off a six pack and get back to the light rail to head to chase field n ngood people excellent food and an ambiance that is worthy of a downtown phoenix revival good work breadfruit i wish others would take your lead upon reading some of these reviews i thought i had walked into the wrong place it is an intimate higher end dining establishment not an applebee s or some drunk woo girl scottsdale bar it sounded like the person nwho went before us was looking for the waiting service to come out and sing happy birthday n ni ve been hard pressed to find anywhere else in arizona with this combination of concept and execution the wait staff was informative and insightful the food is always fresh and the menu is constantly evolving i highly recommend the seared scallop appetizer to start the night you won t regret it the classic jerk chicken off the bone is everything you re looking for in a jamaican dish the fresh cabbage slaw that accompanies the chicken provided the citrusy contrast that you need to elevate the spiciness of the dish they coconut curry tofu is packed with island flavor and is great for the vegetarians out there and for desert get the sweet potato pie my friends and i went to breadfruit and rum bar on friday night i was the last one to show up but from what i was told was the host wouldn t sit us because everyone wasn t present he even offered to sit them at a table sef for but my friends said no cause i was coming when i arrived he took us on the patio and sat us at a table for which confused us because the table had been empty before my arrival after they told me about their experience with the host i told them i had checked out previous reviews and seen a couple stating the host is rude we joked that hosts must come up with various ways to continue putting off customers for the sake of continuing the rude reputation nour waiter was nice but didn t seem to enthusiastic probably a long night all of us were having a good time and taking most everything with a grain of salt but he just wouldn t perk up any he did bring us these tasty little mint leaves gelatin thing i forgot what it was called to cleanse our palate for the meal it was quite nice and refreshing nour food was pretty good i ordered the tofu along with my friend she said hers was cold but mine was warm others got salad and chicken and enjoyed their meals nothing that stands out too much i take that back there was a slice of bell pepper perfectly cooked that little bit was simply amazing the ginger beer and sorrel were both delicious if you decide to go i definitely recommend both drinks however if you do go order your drinks early it took minutes each for a bottle of red stripe and a pina colada ni gave this place two stars because other than the drinks when we got them and bell pepper slice nothing else was memorable maybe i ll try it again eventually and see if we went on an off day pure charm in every way and a perfect kitchen fantastic bartender it s one of the valley s best tuesday night party of four service was amazing and drinks were on point waiter knew every detail of the menu and we took his recommendations n n of us order the jerk pork omg it was the best jerk pork and polenta we ve had we were worried about having jamaican food in phoenix but this placed killed it n nexcited to go back and see what the weekend vibe is like at rum bar overall highly recommend for out of towners great atmosphere great location this must be an up and coming section of phoenix the restaurant is a little hard to spot thank goodness for gps we found a free parking spot a block away very attractive dark wood interior the main dining room is a little noisy when busy but that s to be expected friendly servers we had the hemingway daiquiri s and they were delicious hubby tried the fine arizona wine i recommend you skip that and stick to the rum drinks our food came out very quickly he enjoyed his jerk pork with polenta after a week of eating stadium food at various sports venues i found the mixed greens salad with jerk prawns really hit the spot we were able to walk from there to symphony hall a few blocks n nthis is a note to the service industry in general i don t want to downgrade this particular restaurant i really cannot stand to look at people with things hanging out of their nose some kind of ring or something it looks like they forgot to wipe away their snot if the waitress thought i was rude because i never looked at her while she was talking to us that is why i m sure this is some kind of self expression trend but i think it s disgusting if you don t want to drive away customers don t hire people like that or insist they take it out for work i am a west indian from houston tx and am working out in the desert in az for months i looked up this place online and i am regretting i visited this place i arrived well dressed with a pocket full of money and very hungry around pm and was the first customer it was my first visit and no one told me where to sit or dine until this rude skinny little half island black man with short twisted dred locks approached me i told him it was my first visit and asked him where to sit and he told me if i do not have reservations i would have to sit at the bar and eat how friggin rude so i sat at the bar and noticed all of the workers were white or hispanic and can tell they mostly catered to white or yuppie folks trying to get an island feel however i was born in the caribbean and hate when other wanna be island folks like this skinny black idiot at the breadfruit rum and bar treat their own in disgrace however the bartender brian made an excellent drink from my country s angustora year rum and i wanted another one but was too hungry so i left i then went to caribbean cuisine on the glendale side of town and though it was in a rougher area they welcomed me with open arms like true caribbean people do by far one of my favorite restaurants in the valley i was introduced by my cousins christina and jennifer five years ago and i still get just as excited to eat dinner and have my glass of carrot juice as if it was my first time the food is fresh and original and there s never a bad meal the first time i went it was on a friday evening the small place was filled but they only had one waitstaff on duty and it took us an hour and mins to get food that totally sucked n nyesterday went back and the place was empty and we were served immediately the first time i ordered the jerk chicken and it was barely seasoned yesterday we ordered the jerk shrimp and the jerk sauce was hot and tasty but the shrimp was over cooked n nthe sticks of bread are awesome and kinda sweet and so are the sodas that they serve they are jamaican and made with real sugar cane n ni ll be back but i had much higher hopes i have been regretting this review nwhy because i did my research was looking forward to trying it i read the reviews and i was comfortable that i knew what to expect i went in on a whim on i truly did enjoy my meal and experience only to come home and within a few hours experience one of the worst cases of food poisoning i have had in years n nthe wait staff is very good at garnering the up sale they were very friendly and professional i went with the escoviche fish recommendation blacked fish with coleslaw and a grilled pineapple slice the mango lemonade and the sweet potato puddin almost for just me i felt it a bit over priced even with out my food poisoning nlike i mentioned earlier everything was good and very flavorful i was content and full on the way home i was feeling nothing more than a good meal and initially prepared to give it at least stars n nit is almost days later and i am still not back to normal ni don t plan on stopping in anytime soon thoroughly enjoyed everything about this place the service was the best i ve had in years star all the way the only reason i didn t give this place star is because it s too small food was amazing and as i said our server joni was fabulous pros authentic jamaican cuisine with an organic twist food was very well seasoned waitress christian was knowledgeable and funny drinks were visually stunning strong and delicious rum is the only liquor they offer but they have eclectic drink recipes that will please everyone in your party i myself am a bourbon and vodka girl lots of buzz and great energy in the bar area ncons i made reservations a week in advance for a team dinner i specifically chose this place for two out of four people in my party one being myself to have the curry goat only to be told that the farmer they usually source ther goats from was simply out of goats and therefore they hadnt had goat on the menu for months i informed our waitress that they should take this item off the website and menu furthermore it is business to only use one supplier one of the persons in my party is apache indian and said they have tons of goats quite frankly we were both dumb founded i ordered a second dish to go and was also told i was lucky because they don t allow to go orders because they cant guarantee the food quality once it leaves the establishment but they would allow it since i had already eaten there to that i say again i m dumbfounded guess you wont be able to order on ubereats post mates etc we ended up coming here for dinner and drinks before our flight back to new york from the phoenix airport needless to say we had suitcases with us and they were more than accommodating they sat us at a table that had a little extra room by it so we had space to put our bags they didn t make us feel like a burden which we really appreciated having said that the servers definitely get a perfect ten for hospitality our waiter even showed us some dishes he carried out for other tables to show us what it was such a nice touch n nnow for the best part the food let me tell you that i have had very authentic caribbean food on quite a few islands and this was wonderfully prepared thoughtful dishes with a perfect blend of spices and sauce the desert was fantastic too n nno matter what you order on the menu you must order a cocktail if you don t drink they have some beautiful looking non alcoholic drinks as well they really know how to make a unique drink the only downside was that the happy hour didn t apply at the tables just the bar i know a ton of restaurants do this and it s not like they re the only one but still a bummer excellent food service and atmosphere jose was super friendly and acommodating haven t tried drinks or dinner yet will update review when we do the drinks were fabulous and the meal was delicious i loved the ambiance of the restaurant too the scallops were great i would highly recommend those amazing amazing food amazing drinks i m in love number phoenix spot for me cute and cozy atmosphere and i like restaurants where the kitchen is exposed the jerk chicken was very tender and i liked the coconut rice it came with i would definetly come back i didn t feel this place was the real deal i go to jamaica fairly often and have eaten at some really great restaurants in new york and los angeles when i asked the host part owner why there were no jerk wings on the appertizer menu he decided to give me a cultural lecture on how in his country jamaicans eat the whole bird not sure what that had to do with my question but anyway the food was tasty but weak just like the drinks hard for me to take any jamaican restaurant seriously with no jerk wings on the menu i mean really overpriced for amount of food you get as well also overrated i had high hopes for this place and it is really too bad because i love to support the phoenix area restaurants especially a caribbean one and i had already been to the adjoining rum bar and loved the drinks but the food was bad it was not only bad but by all means avoid the daily market catch it was not fresh at all very over priced for nearly for a simple white fish they could have at least taken the bones out of the thing it tasted like it had been sitting around all day or two in its own juices and when i let the waiter bartender know he just ignored it and then ignored us until we left i will never be back for the food the rum flights are worth a trip there but that is it came with a party of cocktails where unbeatable and i felt fairly priced our waitress was knowledgable as far as ingredients i had plantain springs rolls and my friend had jerk chicken entree very happy with both really a rum lovers heaven i was dying for some jamaican food but the only thing jamaican about this place was the bartender a big disappointment one of our cousins was in town visiting so we decided to bring her to the breadfruit and rum bar for cocktails and dinner this place exceeded our expectations the food is absolutely delicious this isn t a hole in the wall type of ethnic places although i do love those this is a classy joint with fancy gorgeously plated dinner items portions are a little small but the taste more than makes up for that i had the brown stew chicken which is less of a stew and more of melt in your mouth chicken in brown sauce i also sampled the jerk chicken great spices and the coconut mackerel rundown like a tunafish on a chewy wonton i ve never tasted anything like it before but it was delicious as weird as it sounds the cocktails were so well crafted with really subtle flavors that paired well with our meals the daily rum special in a large punch bowl out front was a guava inspired drink so i was in heaven i also sampled the mr smith very strong and with great flavors again the shim sham light and fruity and the bourbon masquerade very aptly named it tasted so much like bourbon the creativity and flavor of the cocktails were fantastic and the place has a literal wall of rum to choose from when designing their drinks the prices are a little expensive but it s definitely worth it for a special night n nthe only thing holding me back from giving stars was the service our waitress was a little pushy appearing visibly upset when we didn t order a small plate appetizer to go with our entrees and drinks and she came off as cold and somewhat snobby overall still probably only one person and maybe she was just having a bad night n noverall check this place out great way to experience jamaican food my first time eating here was great the cocktail i ordered was well balanced and tasty the service was excellent my server christian was super knowledgeable about the food and cocktails and gave me some excellent recommendations she was truly passionate about the food i loved my meal and the cocktail i chose i had the salmon and it was cooked and seasoned perfectly i can t wait to go back very unfriendly staff it s not a welcoming environment everyone seems very unhappy and miserable nthe food is just ok the cocktails are good nnot worth the and i won t be going back came here with some friends for drinks the other night every single cocktail we got was fantastic and we ordered each from the st nd and rd course in that order we had the rum punch apple onia and hot buttered rum lucas our waiter was very prompt and recommended some darn good drinks n nnow for the not so good and for this section i rename the place upper bread crust rum lounge allow me to explain our group of was very diverse and we found the gentleman who showed us to our seats to be very judgemental he accused one of us of smelling funny and almost did not let us in despite a reservation we were allowed in and were seated in the back cigar lounge my wife and i visit a local phoenix restaurant every weekend and never have we experienced this kind of treatment finally our seating location in the back also seemed to be the main travel path for the staff taking out trash and bringing in ingredients we felt like we were in their way as we socialized interrupted several times with rude excuse me s n nwe won t be going back simply due to judgemental and rude staff editing my previous review because i decided to give the rum bar another chance i m glad that i did it was a totally different experience during my subsequent visits i tried the pina colada which is out of this world good the service during our subsequent visits was infinitely better infinitely i m surprised we decided to give this place another shot after our initial experience but i m glad we did it must have been an off night because our following visits have been consistently good n nold review below n ni really wanted to love this place n nmy husband and i just moved to phoenix from the east coast he s a native of the caribbean coast of venezuela and i lived there for many years we know good rum when we saw the aptly named rum bar was only blocks from our home in the arts district we were super happy we decided to give it a go on a night of celebration n nfrom the moment we walked in there was confusion they were about minutes away from closing which we assumed was ample time for a drink and an appetizer i noticed that they had two of our favorite venezuelan rums when i explained to the bartender what kind of rum we typically like and asked if she could recommend something similar so we can broaden our horizons a bit she looked a bit wide eyed and proceeded to ask a man who was sitting on the corner of the bar who i am going to assume is the owner that became the precedent for the evening we asked a question she asked the man at the bar perhaps it was her first night and that s ok but a few smiles would have turned this review into a positive one in addition to her overall unfriendly demeanor we simply couldn t get over how pretentious the place felt my husband ordered a cuba libre the bartender hesitated much longer than was necessary and told him we serve that rum in a snifter effectively telling him he couldn t order what he wanted she then brought him a flight of rum which wasn t even the same brand as the drink he had ordered when we both looked confused she took it away and started to pour another flight by now we were really irritated and felt really unwelcome my husband corrected her again please i d like a cuba libre rum is fun people maybe not wherever the owner is from but in venezuela it s passed around at the beach we drink it at every party formal or otherwise cuba libre is a perfectly legitimate cocktail just as legitimate as the mojito i ordered which i will say was excellent hence the two stars instead of one when it was clear we weren t going to accept the flight of rum she was trying to force on us she walked over the the man at the bar yet again who laughed at our pedestrian choice of drink and waved his hand in resignation she then brought my husband the tiniest most watered down rum and coke imaginable not a cuba libre a rum and coke no lime to speak of when he asked for a lime to turn his rum and coke into some semblance of a cuba libre she said oh you wanted lime with that incredulously n nwe ordered the plantain spring rolls with mango chutney they were utterly tasteless except for the chutney it was basically store bought frozen won ton wrapper and not a hint of sweet plantain not one hint n nwe re exceptionally disappointed that we didn t love this place the only redeeming factors not for us we won t be back are the prices which are reasonable and their good selection of rums i was in phoenix for a conference and found the breadfruit through a web search it s just a short walk nw of the convention center the first night i was there i was amazed at the bar s wall full of rum more than varieties but more about that later the dining area was rather small but i was able to get a table during the week not the same story on a weekend night reservations are recommended the waitstaff had spot on descriptions of the food and cocktails and was passionate about the fare the menu had quite a lot of seafood options from mussels to prawns to the catch of the day red snapper when i visited the scallops appetizer was delicious two large juicy scallops seasoned to perfection i was glad i took the waiter s recommendation and ordered the prawns the curry sauce was creamy with a mild flavor since i couldn t decide between that or the jerk i had to come back a couple nights later to try the free range jerk chicken which was savory and spicy both meals were exceptional and my only regret was that i wasn t in phoenix longer to try some other dishes the meals ranged between and now back to the rum bar the bar staff is very knowledgeable and friendly during my two visits i tried several of the cocktails and was not disappointed with any each drink was made with fresh ingredients and with a variety of rums you ll not find captain morgan or bacardi here rather rums from the caribbean and central america dominate and they even have a rum from tennessee with a bit of a bourbon taste you ll also not find whiskey or vodka just rum red stripe and wine they offer some rum flights at a reasonable price and it s a great opportunity to try different brands of rum and different ages the owner and bartenders will tell you anything you want to know about the various rums i felt like i should have been taking notes i cannot recommend the breadfruit highly enough and will definitely return again on my next visit to phoenix if you re traveling for a convention steer away from the chain and concept restaurants at cityscape and try this independently owned authentic taste of jamaica this was a great place to have a dinner n nwe arrived ordered a number of different cocktails appetizers and entrees and we were not disappointed n nfrankly i d go back if i lived in the neighborhood pompous n nthis review is based solely on the service on one individual the manager refused to seat my party because individuals were running a bit behind we wished to order appetizers and drinks while we waited but were told we would not be able to be seated until the arrived instead we opted to sit at the bar and have a drink however the management thought that was not acceptable as well and demanded we wait outside all of this occurred as the restaurant lay empty at pm on a saturday night n nafter reading other reviews this seems to be a common theme for breadfruit i wont be coming back i pray ownership takes notice of this trend and remedies the problem before they close their doors this little place absolutely rocks your tastebuds have visited twice and will make it a regular lunch stop the jerk chicken is absolutely delicious and yes a bit spicy as it should be we ve also had the avocado plantain spring rolls amazing and the spinach pattie the mango lemonade with mint is so refreshing and tasty n ndon t deprive yourself of lunch at the breadfruit one of downtown s very best n nupdate they no longer serve lunch its a nice place the rum bar makes an ol fashioned with rum that i had never had it was pretty good cant really say the same about the food though it was ok im jamaican expected better the portions were very small for the price i ll probably go back and try it more time or at least for drinks n kanye shrug the food is good for the most part salt is their favorite ingredient so if you really like to taste the food you won t the ingredients are top notch i did not try any of the drinks but they looked good and many others were enjoying them this would be a good place to have a drink before a show tasty jamaican food and delicious fruity drinks but overpriced for the fare atmosphere service just ok the back patio is really nice but there are so many wonderful places to eat downtown i d skip this one short review drinks are overpriced service was good cod fritter sauce was to salty ambiance is excellent polenta is amazing smoked pork is kinda bland and rum flights are decent food was great service was horrible to the point i completely forgot how good the food was we arrived at happy hour time they would not want to accomadate the happy hour price then they refused to give any pepper or some chilli to my friend whose food was not spicy enough then when my guests arrived later they would refuse to put a chair at our table though are table was big enough to seat two more people there easily and after all these annoying push backs they would not split checks and out of us had to do our own math and the last strike was when the server came and told a friend that she had to sign a tab seriously people you have a restuarant in az don t you know any amount under does not have to be signed in state of az bottom line if this restaurant does not start to accomadate their guests they will loose customers i know i will not go back there again and will not recommend them to any one i know this was a perfect date night after a horrible week of not seeing my husband due to his job n nwe knew we wanted to go out for dinner and breadfruit has been on my list of places to go since we moved here finally tonight was the night we decided to go n nwe didn t have a reservation but went around early dinners suit us nthey seated us outside tonight was perfect for it around degrees and amazing no chill just perfect and comfortable n nrum punch so good scallops delicious we shared them i had the lobster he had the house special red snapper we were both very happy with our meals the portions were perfect we love experiencing more flavors and high quality food over large portions i love leaving a meal not feeling stuffed but perfect content this was that feeling n nall the drinks which came recommended by our great server were smooth and oh so good the coconut bread pudding was also very yummy and crisp on the outside and soft on the inside i wanted a little something like creme fraiche or a small bit of ice cream for it but it was very good on it s own n ni would certainly return again but it was definitely a splurge but a very happy splurge the food is ok but the service is absolutely terrible recently i stopped by the restaurant with a party of on a friday night at p m the restaurant was near empty and we inquired for a table but the host was extremely snobby and impatient he told us there was a hour wait even though there were at least three tables available that could accommodate us when i asked to be put on the waiting list he rolled his eyes and said that he would only accept a waitlist for a party of when i asked whether they could even seat he again rolled his eyes that it s there was a pizzeria down the street that this restaurant was for a more intimate setting n nhis explanation was perfectly reasonable but his tone was extremely condescending this is downtown phoenix not la and we certainly are not at a michelin star restaurant love this place i ve been here twice and both times have had excellent drinks and food with service that was knowledgeable classy and made great recommendations moving to az from s fl i miss caribbean food and this place gets it done although a bit more upscale than the actual caribbean can t wait to go back the caribbean food that i m used to deep fries just about everything fried plantains empanadas etc loads you up with rice leaves you feeling like you might develop instant diabetes n nthe breadfruit was the perfect change from that n nthe decor is great i felt transported to somewhere tropical almost like i could step outside on the beach not in a tacky way it was very authentic made me think of past excursions to the caribbean the patio was cute but small so we opted to stay inside service was everything i expect from waitstaff our waitress was super attentive knowledgeable n ni ordered a couple of cocktails from the rum bar which i definitely recommend doing mojito classic to start the meal because i m boring also beets the blues because i couldn t look away from it both were glorious n nwe started the meal with plantain avocado spring rolls interesting the mango chutney was the star of that dish my boyfriend ordered the jerk chicken salad i wasn t expecting much from a salad but it was great you can tell everything is made with fresh quality ingredients i wish more restaurants were like this n ni had the guava glazed pork belly melt in your mouth pork with a tangy sweet sauce if i was a little more tipsy i probably would have licked my plate the mash included on the plate was also delicious but i find myself fantasizing over the pork belly so good n nall in all it was great i can t wait to go back the breadfruit is a staple restaurant for my girlfriend and i we re usually in here once a month or so it s a small quiet restaurant tucked into downtown while small it s nicely decorated with rotating local artists work displayed on the walls service is always very friendly and usually pretty quick n nthe entres are all generally pretty first rate though i usually get the curried chicken the brown stew chicken and jerk chicken are both excellent choices on the vegetarian side of things the pop cho with ginger is amazing i love the sweet potato mash with garlic unfortunately it wasn t on the menu the last time i was there not sure if it ll be making a return or not n npersonally i like spicy food so i ve never had any issue with it being overly hot in terms of consistency it s always fresh and excellent one of the more consistent restaurants in this regard most of the entrees are in the range which i think is very reasonable n nif i was going to nitpick at anything it d be the appetizers not the quality which is generally very good the festivals with the nice mango chutney are usually our pick but the pricing with shrimp and scallop appetizers being more expensive than most the entrees it just seems odd though i m sure getting quality fresh seafood in phoenix probably isn t cheap n n edit breadfruit now has a liquor license and is no longer byob bummer n nalso their specials tend to be significantly pricier than most their menu items like double average entree cost but they don t go out of their to mention this so be sure to ask pricing on the specials hmmm where do i start save your money n nhonestly if you don t mind paying through the ear for a mediocre meal then feel free and pay a visit but don t say yelp reviewers didn t give you fair warning n nso i was taken here for my birthday and i was super excited i had heard good reviews and could not wait to get my hands on some stew chicken n nwe started out with the drink menu the mango drink with mint is very good and reasonably priced compared to everything on the menu n nsince we heard the portions were small we decided we would each get an app share and then each order entrees n nthe festival with mango chutney taste was good price was ridiculous they seriously make tiny breadsticks cut them in half and stick it in a small bowl of chutney i don t care what fancy ingredients you use but for at least add some more breadsticks n nthe plantain and avocado rolls were also small the plantain was not even fully ripened and the cost was these ingredients are not fancy or expensive and the flavor was disappointing n ni decided that i was going to get the the jamaican patty with fish but after being slightly confused by the waitress i ended up ordering the chefs special appetizer omg what a mistake n nthe chef s special was fish springrolls with mango and spinach or some other green served with a spicy sauce the flavor was bitter and it needed more fish especially when i saw the price after the bill came for the smallest spring rolls in the world and the fish in it probably the scraps left over after they get the filets off the bone for an entree n nthe stew chicken that i was soo excited about ehhh i ve made better with a half ass recipe n nthe only thing i found that was rare and delicious was a boiled green banana that is hard to find in phoenix although a roasted sweet potato or yam would have fit in as well n nthe curry chicken and dumpling is a joke you get about small pieces of a cut chicken breast and a big dense dumpling i was afraid to take too much when i asked if i could taste so i took a sliver or chicken and a sliver of dumpling not impressed n nthe rice and plantain on the plate was ok but again the plantain was not fully ripened n nthe best thing on my plate was grilled piece of cabbage and the boiled banana n nnow that i think of it for a restaurant that is is focused on local ingredients and the experience of eating your food etc why the heck would they serve mangoes plantains and green bananas and anything with fish for that matter seems at odds with the philosophy n nall in all diners repeat customers n nthe space is nice the service is friendly n nfood is ok prices are ridiculous ni would not recommend it to my friends in all it was an amazing dining experience n nwe made reservations which i strongly recommend that you do our server tamara was a delight this was a first time experience for each of us and she walked us though the menu and was very helpful and friendly n natmosphere and environment nthe decor and arrangement of the restaurant is really interesting it s very tight quarters but comfortable n nservice nthis is a big one for me we experienced some good and some not so good n waited at the door for several minutes before anyone greeted us the first person who did was the bartender who told us to sit and wait not unpleasant but i would expect a simple hello we will be right with you or at least some acknowledgment when we first walked in n table side server was great but things did slow down the longer we sat there at one point i had to drink water from my boyfriend s glass because i had been empty so long n we had menu items that were d and we were not able to try them red snapper a rum and a dessert n we were told we could go out to the cigar patio by one server and order dessert once we were out there told by another server that we could not n nfood drink n the food was amazing it s a combination of spices and favors that i m not used i will say it s not for everyone but it really is delicious n it is a little pricey n the drinks are amazing we each ordered signature drinks and rum flights n dessert kinda terrible i can only assume it was authentic some kind of sweet potato pie with coconut and molasses but we didn t like at all n nin all it was a great evening with friend and we made memories that we will cherish i m not sure that we will be back unless an opportunity arises but i m glad i did try it had never realized the breadth of rum s flavor recommend pulling up to the bar and allowing the bartender to guide you pairing cocktails with courses everything eaten and sipped knocked my socks off most notably the scallops clams and all the kong s men the latter looks like a storm cloud mysterious and lovely this establishment is a gem i little bit of montego bay in the middle of downtown phoenix what a pleasant surprise to walk into this oasis of reggae and caribbean food the atmosphere and vibe at the bar are relaxed and tropical the decor matches the theme with distressed woods and bright colors all that s missing is a whiff of ganja and you d be in jamaica i ate in the bar area but the menu comes from breadfruit the adjoining restaurant i enjoyed the food i had the jerk prawn avocado salad and boy was it spicy the menu indicates heat so be aware they aren t kidding the salad was huge with lots of avocado and prawns this could be a meal for most people i also had the jerk chicken and it was well prepared and also spicy the sides were colorful a cabbage pineapple slaw i had a few glasses of local wine by the glass at happy hour prices and enjoyed it who knew arizona made wine the bartender was friendly and attentive and the crowd eating at the bar was chatty and friendly as well i will definitely go back the next time i am in the area i ll pack my bob marley t shirt so i can blend in dear breadfruit n we became acquainted on the internet like so many relationships these days do and i must admit that i became fascinated with you quickly your menu sang to me with so many tasty words and your location couldn t be better n nwe finally met last night and i am disappointed while you have a very cheery atmosphere and wonderful staff your food just didn t woo me at all the fish was overcooked burned on the ends even and left me unsatisfied the slaw looked promising but proved to be nearly impossible to eat you try picking up long strings of cabbage and bean sprouts just see what happens and the breadstick oy the taste of it was fantastic but it was so overdone that i thought for a second that i might have to send you a dentist s bill if i finished it n nmy dining companion was enamored with your curry tofu sadly the one bite of his tofu ended up being the highlight of my meal sigh n ni wish that things had turned out better breadfruit because i really wanted to like you but when visiting you leaves me hungry for the hole in the wall caribbean place on camelback and th ave i know that it just isn t going to work out n ngood luck to you n nps did a midget design your bathroom i had no idea they even made sinks that small the breadfruit offers a world class caribbean cocktail and culinary experience unique to itself so if you re acquainted with the flavors of the caribbean the breadfruit is quite familiar to the palate they successfully deliver the essence of the caribbean though masterfully created complex and exciting unique cocktails and food items while the breadfruit definitely has the best cocktails in phoenix the atmosphere there provides a bit of an escape from the desert s valley the ambiance is classy and sophisticated yet warm and friendly and very different from anything else downtown it delivers the relaxed vibe and delicious flavors you ll recognize from the islands and it s where i go in phoenix to escape phoenix it s party on the palate what great time on saturday night loved the whole fried red snapper and pina coladas the drinks were tasty the food was delicious the restaurant is cool and charming would go back in a heartbeat i found this place a few years back but just never made it in last night we decided to celebrate our th anniversary here i m so glad with my choice everything we ordered last night was great i ordered the jerk pork over polenta prefect pepper shrimp a must try drink menu phenominal i tried almost everything everyone ordered we re all family the mojito on point punch rum bowl of the day yum pina colada bootleg smitty rum old fashion all very good of course we tried a rum flight spanish we started in the dining area due to a few unforeseeable mishaps we moved our party of outside to the front patio for or meal ended the night in the back patio with our rum flight and cigar thank you so vey much for the amazing and unforgettable st time experience our server by the way was pretty awesome hats off to you isaac g we were definitely movers last night and you kept up with us all until next time just sipping a snake preview from the spring cocktail lineup french marmalade wow it is sensational and after trying gin rummy and jolly roger i m trying to decide which one i like best tough choice nthey are all great my vote tonight french marmalade nfor appetiser snacks we had plantain avocado spring rolls baked in a wanton wrap and served with mango salsa great pairing ni m glad to be back in phoenix we haven t been to breadfruit in a long time and we were pleasantly surprised we remembered the cozy little spot with good food and decided to go back i d definitely go there again we had a reservation and we were greeted seated and had a waiter at out table within minutes saturday night it was crowded but they handled it well n nthe meal was spectacular i always look at the accompaniments and the jerk chicken off the grill came with roasted vegetables and dirty rice the rice was cooked perfectly the grains were identifiable and crisp the veggies were superb squash broccoli and parsnips crisp and presented well the chicken was ample and done as well as i ve ever had the best part was the sauce that came with the chicken i considered asking for a glass of it so i could drink it but i didn t have the nerve n nbesides supporting a local merchant go there you ll get a great meal at a very reasonable price was excited to dine here until the host in the fedora was extremely rude judgmental curt and unwelcoming maybe next time will be a better experience we left before finding out leaves much to be desired overpriced better jamaican food in the valley after getting reheated stake red beans and rice brought it to the owners attention he did nothing about it and had the audacity to charge me for the meal this restaurant may be good for folks who don t really know authentic west indian cuisine my gf says take me out for a rum drink i says your wish is my command n nbeautiful little restaurant opens at downtown a very kind sir welcomes us in i see the rum punch and i order up now this rum punch is delicious but i would have liked it to be stronger ya know punch i decided to add a shot to our drinks with a haitian five star rum n nwe also had an app of cuban style pork tenderloin sandwiches using fried plantains my gf enjoyed them i just am not crazy for plantains anyway cozy seating and we had a good time wow we finally found this place after mos of salivating and anticipating well let me tell you it was well worth the wait we accidentally stumbled in after riding around on bikes looking for a place with a byob policy sure am glad the sushi place next door had a not so friendly or inviting bartender otherwise we would have stayed and missed bread fruit we were the first to arrive so we had first choice which was of course outside only problem with the outside dining is the chairs with rounded legs on the grass which was very shaky other than that everything else was great we were riding around on bikes and this was the first stop so we went with a plethora of sides and we were pleasantly surprised at the flavors and intricacies of each simple dish they looked so simple but tasted very true to the islands i ve been to jamaica and have to say that i felt sa though i had been secretly flown back there without my knowledge only thing missin was the ocean the simplest dishes were the best and most tasty i mean it doesn t get any simpler than steamed cabage and peppers but hello tasty coconut after taste the dumplings were tasty too i loved the sauce had to try both and i devoured them the coleslaw was my second fav very simple but filled with tons of flavor sa the night progressed about table tops showed up so if i have to guess pm is a great time to go and be served fast yes you can take ur own wine not sure about beer since we were biking and didn t want to ride full i didn t do desert however next time im trying the pudding enjoy this hidden treasure i sure did both the meal and service were wonderful n nthe highlights were the hot buttered rum jerk chicken and the polenta wasn t as in love with the pound cake or jerk pork but they were still good n nyes the mango fish rolls http www yelp com biz_photos the breadfruit phoenix select kklpgd aa bpvwdonaufyg kklpgd aa bpvwdonaufyg were definitely crispy and tasted delicious and yes the oven roasted plantains http www yelp com biz_photos the breadfruit phoenix select q jpbnwkko gme g w ta q jpbnwkko gme g w ta were firm on the outside and just like buttah on the inside but were they worth and plus tax respectively i don t think so i took photos of the food w a pen next to the plates to show you how small these portions were really for a small mango fish roll sliced three ways and i m supposed to feel good about ordering an entree and dessert after n nthe sweet potato pudd n http www yelp com biz_photos the breadfruit phoenix select ghufceowcgwschxrw zmva ghufceowcgwschxrw zmva was just absolutely fabulous but you won t catch me driving all the way to the breadfruit to spend my hard earned money here at least i know they ve reinvested some of the profits into remodeling the place it looked fifty times better than when it did on its first year of opening if you wish to dine and converse w your companions it s best not to come here on the weekends when next door rum bar is hopping then again maybe it was just hopping on this night bec of the rum tasting event held there i haven t been back since so i don t know how busy these two businesses are i am giving the breadfruit stars because i was able to consume the food however it had zero flavor i started with the plantain and avocado spring rolls i had curry tofu for my entree which was served with rice and peas i usually not put salt on my food but unfortunately i had to ask for salt to add some flavor for dessert i had a sweet potato pudding which the server described as a cake like texture it was closer to a pie non the positive side the sorrel drink was good and vibe was ok with jamaican music playing in the background we all decided on a whim at pm on a friday night to eat here because two members of our group recommended it with gusto nso it s friday night and we expected to walk straight in and find a table not exactly we just hoped that we would be able to get fed sometime before midnight we were very fortunate only to have to wait for about minutes nwe were seated at an outside table perfect position as the weather was mild and the area is filled with interesting people nthis restaurant focuses well on two things rum cocktails and authentic jamaican food they have both down to an art nwe were very fortunate to have a pair of waiters with style and a sense of humor i know that many waiters can get a reputation for being a little standoffish but our waiters seemed to actually enjoy what they were doing they turned a very good meal into a memorable experience nso why am i only giving this place four stars i found two bones in my mackerel reduction as this was a stew like dish i was not expecting any bones and i was very surprised when i pulled them out of my mouth expecting simply to find something vegetable based that was a little tough nwe were tempted with dessert and even though the portions were small the taste was enough to complement and complete the meal nthis place definitely deserves another visit review i will be back for the hot buttered rum cocktail for sure our group enjoyed a taste from the punch bowl and it was quite delicious a pomegranate black cherry maple concoction was served and i was worried it might be too sweet but it packed a lot of flavor and a good punch haha sometimes a pre mixed drink special at restaurants are either too sweet watered down or possibly even too strong this one was delightful n na couple in our group ordered a nd cocktail hot buttered rum i enjoyed a sip and it was sooo good on the next chilly night downtown i will be back to partake a glass or two n ni learned you can also enjoy a cigar here and i have to say i don t recall the place wreaking of cigar smoke so that s a plus if you re worried about leaving with a cigar smoke smell on your clothes n ndrinks were a bit pricey but the quality of what i tasted was great and i loved the ambiance dim lighting chill quiet perfect for a date night the best part of my experience here was the capriana it was sweet and delicious the server was pretty good and very friendly n ni ordered the jerk prawns which cost and i received medium sized prawns on a skewer not only was i disappointed in the lack of prawns they were terribly overdone very dry the flavoring was pretty ok but couldn t make up for the dryness it also came with coleslaw grilled pineapple and corn and festival bread which wasn t bad i sampled my friends tropical salad which had yummy dressing and seemed more filling than my pricier meal n ni was pretty hungry and i left the restaurant feeling like i needed to have a snack i don t mind small portions if the food is really good but this place just didn t have it n ni might consider coming back here for yummy drinks but it s doubtful that would be enough motivation to bring me back in great food the patio is perfect drinks are well made i am not a big rum drinker but absolutely loved the drinks i tried loved the vibe n ni suggest the scallops and jerk chicken first visit and it exceeded reviews and expectations service was top line menu filled with local quality ingredients we enjoyed shrimp and cauliflower cake small plate loved white fish and short rib both delicious but the short rib was big winner rum drinks were incredible i removed a star because their signature dessert was literally one of the worst things i ve ever tasted horrible way to end such a delicious meal i couldn t get the awful molasses taste out of my mouth and paid for that awfulness sad way to end an expensive yummy meal left a bad last impression my all time favorite restaurant in phoenix never a dull moment the owners run a very tight ship which i respect the staff is very keen on what it is they are serving the kitchen produces mouthwatering dishes that excites with every bite and not to mention the cocktails sigh kudos to the owners you guys have a great thing going this is my second visit to the breadfruit the food is stars but the restaurant is stars i am deducting star for not having rum cake on the menu at a jamaican restaurant totally blows my mind i was told that the desert is rotational and that today s desert was carrot cake well we were here on saturday and carrot cake was the desert i m taking a star away for a the service being a tad slow food is great taste authentic and is prepared with lots of love n nthe rum punch changes daily the one i tried was delicious excellent new in town for business and was tired of mexican food being caribbean myself this was nice to introduce to my friend who is hear on business as well those scallops were life all in itself rum was perfect excellent service from javier the host and everyone else thank you again i will be back and i have already recommended that place to other colleagues thank you javier we started at the bar with rum drinks with amazing flavors the appetizers were complex and fantastic what a great night great service too the staff was well trained and efficient for a restaurant in phoenix we felt like we were in ny or chicago a bit pricey but the curry veggie was good and the mixed rum punch cocktail was so yummy definitely would come back bf and his cousin enjoyed their food very much and said the salmon was delicious i hated this place to put it mildly i don t eat meat and there was only one vegetarian entree that was not a salad on the menu when i ordered it the server told me they didn t have it tonight because they were out of one ingredient bok choy n nreally the chef can t get creative and substitute something in order for you prepare your only vegetarian option broccoli napa cabbage swiss chard celery collard greens beet greens or any number of other perfectly fine substitutes would have worked or how about this radical approach have somebody run to the closest grocery store and pick up some fucking bok choy n nafter dinner we called for a cab to take us to our next destination the place was not packed but the staff got shitty about us waiting at our table after we had spent a couple hundred bucks the service overall was pretty snobby n noh and they didn t have vodka i get that it s a rum bar but i just think any place with the word bar in the name should have a token bottle of vodka tequila or something for people who don t like rum i mean breadfruit carries over types of rum i think they could sacrifice a teeny bit of space for a couple of other spirits n noverall very disappointing my first time here and after the first drink before food arrived i already promised myself that i will be back savannah our server has been fantastic extremely knowledgeable about the food and drink menus and very friendly she has been very attentive even as the night has gone on and the restaurant has filled up we tried five things on the menu and reordered one dish for a second time because it was so good the mussels get them twice we were lucky to find this place online and already looking forward to my next visit it was okay service was efficient but not overly welcoming felt a little rushed the food was alright nothing to go crazy about know that it s nothing like an authentic jamaican restaurant the fish cakes were just okay too much dough for the amount of fish the rum glazed prawns were good and nicely spiced my curried goat lacked some kick and substance my favorite part was the daily punch which had a nice spice to it without being overly sweet would come back but i have other places to try out i really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere here while we visited phoenix i had a delicious spicy goat over rice and started sampling my way through the crafted rum cocktails our server was fantastic professional and really helped us find our way through the menu she was able to suggest cocktails that fit our preferences and really took great care of us after dinner we went out back for cigars on the patio i m not a cigar smoker but my boyfriend was pleased with the selection we found some comfortable chairs back there and eventually began chatting with the group on the neighboring couch while we enjoyed the mild phoenix night and interesting decor i can see myself coming back next time i m in phoenix oh my goodness was this place good the drinks were phenomenal the food was so amazing and flavorful our server was knowledgeable and did a great job i will definitely be returning i wanted to try this place so i got on their web page to look at the menu a menu with no prices are they joking then i looked at the drink menu and again no prices are they joking then i tried to email them and find there is no e mail are they joking the reservation system is a computer automated clunk that wasn t working i might still go as my friends want to but i have wasted all this time time i could have spent eating and i think somewhere else when a business makes it this hard to give them my money i say pass for now was excited to check this restaurant out but should have looked at yelp reviews first had a punch bowl which was marginal at best tried the plantains appetizer which were lukewarm with no flavor wouldn t have been so bad if waiter didn t rave about our choices then the wait began for our entrees minutes later the jerk chicken and mussels we ordered still hadn t been delivered when we asked for our waiter he couldn t be found in the teeny tiny restaurant i went by the kitchen and was told the chicken wasn t ready does it really take minutes for the chicken to get to temperature we decided to leave as the waiter or manager didn t bother to come speak to us good drinks n ndecent food but not nearly great n noverpriced compared to what you receive n na lot of hype for what is honestly just an average place to eat n nnot so terrible that i wouldn t go back to try a new different entree but sure as heck wouldn t be the top of my list of places to go i liked breadfruit and the concept of caribbean food but the food is really healthy and is missing some jamaican flavor also the food takes a really long time to come out i got the jerk chicken it was a large dry chicken breast but it did have flavor my recommendation is try it if you want some food that is different just don t think you are eating true caribbean food appetizers were great main dish was over priced and ordinary nwould go back for appetizers drinks don t stay for dinner breadfruit and rum bar is one of my favorite restaurants bars in downtown phoenix their food is always great i can t find food like it anywhere else in the valley i strongly recommend to have the scallops best scallops i ve had before coming to rum bar thought i didn t like rum but the bartenders helped me realize that rum is much more complex than just bacardi i ve been regularly coming to breadfruit and rum bar for about months now and they never disappoint the breadfruit as it is now makes me sad sweet pea and i were early breadfruit adopters back when there weren t dozens of great restaurants downtown back when it was a tiny place with no liquor license where you could byob sit with or so other people and watch one guy cook your dinner breadfruit has changed a lot and not for the better n ni suggested breadfruit for dinner before an event because we hadn t been there in a year at least and sweet pea loves the jerk chicken and i love the coconut curried tofu so we get there and like separate people asked us if we have a reservation it hadn t even occurred to me to make a reservation for pm even on a saturday night but the place was full after they told us that it will either be an hour for a table or we can sit at the bar we decided to sit at the bar since our event started at pm and i generally don t mind eating at the bar anyway unfortunately we ended up with me sitting on the end by the service well so it was sub optimal also when i picked up the drink menu there was a dead moth underneath that i had to brush away n nthe bartender poured us some waters and asked us if we ve been there and we said yes then sweet pea ordered a dark and stormy which is a very typical rum drink this being a rum bar and all the bartender says uh we like to keep it on menu have you been here before awkward no we were lying we explained that we had but that it had been awhile and then we felt like crap after all the do you have reservations inquiries and now this we felt unwelcome and out of place rearding the dark and stormy ever since they opened rum bar they ve been all uppity about their rum drink menu i have been there and tried to order a rum and diet and been smacked down hard because g d forbid they serve such a pollutant as diet coke with their beloved rum whatever but a dark and stormy is a classic rum cocktail the best they could offer sweet pea if he likes dark and stormys was a mojito which is nothing like a dark and stormy he got it and i tasted it and honestly it may be the best mojito i ve ever had but still i tried to order an iced tea but they didn t have that either i considered sparkling water but noticed it listed on the beverage menu like all the rums with its country of origin mexico and decided against it n nwe ordered the plantain avocado spring rolls to split then sweet pea tried to order the jerk chicken which has to be most peoples main reason to go to a jamaican restaurant but they told him they don t have it although it s on the menu what they did offer instead was a half chicken something or other which is not on the menu but is more and doesn t even have jerk spice he decided to order the jerk pork and polenta instead n nthe spring rolls were pretty pedestrian and small at rolls split in half for and it just made us miss the patties they used to have they gave us a palate cleanser in between courses which was unnecessary but speaks to what this place now envisions itself as having become my tofu was the same as always good and sweet pea did really like his jerk pork but we both miss the old breadfruit and with all of the restaurants that we now have downtown we will most likely not be coming back it s a shame the breadfruit is wonderful place to eat healthy yummy food just came from there with a friend we shared the kiwi pineapple drink and carrot coconut milk drink both were awesome though we preferred the carrot then we shared the escovitch fish heavenly jerk chicken best i ve ever had and the ital sampler which i would skip in the future as it was just meh the plantains were pretty good not the best ever i liked how fresh everything tasted especially the coleslaw the food is a bit spicy which i like i can t wait to go back and save room for dessert group of dined at the breadfruit on a friday night i had initially made reservations for at but then when another couple wanted to join us open table would no longer let me edit our reservation so i called to change the number dining however no one there answered the phone at pm and their voicemail says do not leave a voicemail umm okay anyway so we get there at pm and they are able to modify our reservation for us even though they were completely packed per the host they could seat us at the table the sat us at was actually empty the minutes we were waiting so not sure why we couldn t be sat right away n ntable ordered drinks the rum punch is extremely delicious and is made fresh and different every day table also tried multiple other drinks and all were great if you are willing to wait min per cocktail we even tried ordering our next drink while our original was nearly full hoping to make up for the extremely long cocktail wait but we still would wait forever with empty drinks in front of us n nappetizers that were ordered came out quick and were tasty however our actual meal took nearly an hour and half so if you are in any sort of rush i do not recommend this place our server was nice and tried and i do not feel our incredibly long waits were anything in his control but the kitchen and bar need to get their act together n nthe host there is also incredibly rude as stated he was able to modify the reservation but made it a big deal first and acted like we were causing a huge inconvenience to his night my husband went in to use the restroom and was accused of not actually being a customer there even though this is the same guy that sat us and we had been on the patio waiting forever not really a great way to treat your customers who are pretty irritated to begin with simply the best jerk chicken i have ever had i sat at the bar which could use some acoustic management but the staff was great drinks were wonderful but expensive i did feel i got my moneys worth i will be going back this place was amazing great staff we have scallops as an app and then prawns for meal both were amazing food was great we had the jerk chicken pork and polenta and lamb everything was very good except for service bartenders were short and rude and not very welcoming server was very unpleasant and seemed very unhappy and impatient we will not be back only had drinks the drink menu was extensive and the drinks were delicious service was very slow will likely return to try the food had the fourty six food is bland small portions not authentic and very overpriced would absolutely not recommend going here for a meal service was good though nice ambience didn t get drinks so can t comment on that might be a good place to go for just drinks though based on other reviews loved the beautifully curated drinks the ambience was perfect and the pepper shrimp lived up to its promise of being super spicy i love this place their chutney dish is absolutely amazing though i have gotten a pie there once before which was terrible most of their food is great it s very small but does offer outside seating which is great during the month or two when it s nice outside i generally dislike seafood but i fell in love with caribbean food during my honeymoon in the bahamas the flavors were so wonderful and the quality and freshness of the ingredients so much different than i had grown up with that it truly changed my perspective i still may not clamor for seafood and still greatly prefer milder fish to the more robust and fishier options but i appreciate fresh seafood when i can get it n nimagine my surprise then when i discovered not only fantastic fresh seafood in the middle of downtown but also a restaurant that brought the flavors of my honeymoon rushing back breadfruit pleased from the get go when my wife and i ate there recently n none of the seafoods i like least is scallops a fact i am coming to accept is because they are typically frozen and overcooked to a displeasing rubbery texture i have only ever eaten scallops at one restaurant moto that were good still my wife loves scallops and i love jerk flavors so we ordered the appleton rum sea scallops which are covered in a jerk rub suffice to say i now have eaten two scallop dishes i love the jerk seasoning was wonderfully spicy and the scallops were perfectly seared and cooked until they were just translucent in the center they were soft enough to cut with a fork and practically melted in your mouth n nfor dinner i had the escovitch fish which was atlantic red snapper on the day we dined red snapper is a fish i discovered in the bahamas and this dish reminded me how good it can be the filet was cooked perfectly and the escovitch sauce essentially a spicy vinegar mixture was quite good as were the pickled vegetables that accompanied it n nafter much deliberation my wife chose the brown stew chicken which while complexly flavored was quite dry and overcooked which was a shame her dish was the one blemish on our meal but the rest of the food was so good and the untried items on the menu so appetizing that we will definitely return n nalso a note the portions are small but this is an upscale caribbean restaurant where the focus is much more on quality over quantity the food is good but way overpriced nthe service is awful i have been on three separate occasions and each time i end up leaving angry that the waitstaff or owner has somehow managed to insult me n nfor the money i would much rather go somewhere nicer one of the best places in the valley to get a cocktail these guys are going on my rapidly expanding pissed at myself for not checking out sooner list i m not a rum drinker but fortunately they have plenty of non rum drinks n ni started with devil in a blue dress which was neither sweet nor bitter not my favorite drink but not for lack of skill on the bartender s part i moved on to kiwi reserve which was much more my style and did have mt gay as one of the ingredients n nrum bar is very classy and low key and the bartenders are true mixologists with knowledge on par with a chemist they know their shit and they take their craft seriously which is apparent in every stage of the drink preparation n nthis is a nice relaxing place to come relax and in casual yet sophisticated environment and i can t wait to come back n nhighly recommend came in from california for a few days and this place was an amazing find we had three drinks and they were all excellent my favorite was probably the punch which was just all orange bitters orange juice and rum bitbit changes every day so ask first another excellent drink was the sugarfoot a little bit sweet but great as a second drink and then we looked at the other reviews and got the rum old fashioned stronger and to the point got the baked plantains which come with mango chutney and cinnamon highly recommend them nthe service was just great our server isaac was friendly and fun to talk with sitting on the front porch with reggae playing softly and we just started drifting off to the carribean i thought this place was a bit of a let down i really enjoyed the rum punch however breadfruit was the perfect place to have my birthday dinner although it s a bit small they accommodated our party of the food is something to rave about with the browned chicken stew that uses few ingredients but key ingredients in making a good dish i e ginger spices etc my friend had the chicken and dumplings which she could take it or leave it since the wheat dumplings were dense however the jerk chicken was described as very good it included a juicy and tender piece of chicken and the right combination of corn plantains and pineapples they advertise using fresh local ingredients and you can tell with the vegetables that were perfectly cooked crispy another friend ordered the curried tofu which was full of flavor and a dish that i am going to try next time n noverall breadfruit has great food excellent price for the quality of food fun selection of non alcoholic beverages and a byob option i will come back and see you again where have you been all my life we only stopped in for drinks but they were yummy gabby was able to recommend wonderful drinks based on our preferences and she was very attentive to our table i can t wait to come back to try your food choices okay and some more of those delicious cocktails quaint relaxing bar in downtown phoenix attached to the breadfruit you better like rum though options are quite limited if you don t i tried the special punch of the day and it was delicious but they had me at strawberry ok i came here with my fellow cs after a yelp event so not the best idea n ni had already a princess treat at yelp event so to try a so so piña colada was not the best but we got a rectification of our experience with the avocado plantain starter this is a weird delicious tasty mix for an appetizer they mix it with a mango sauce that despite your mind says no your mouth says yes n nafter this and trying another creation my friend order it is worth to consider to come back and try it with a clean mind few places i ve been to around the country catch my attention enough to warrant a review even more rare is a star read the below stars they pretty say everything i wanted say i run a very reputable bar and restaurant myself and breadfruit is what i aspire to have someday simply put its hands down the best place to eat and drink in phoenix you must sit at the bar though in years and tens of thousands of dollars spent on various meals and drinks at hundreds of places this is my go to and favorite place meh n noverpriced psuedo urban hoity toity experience n nshould you come here at least once and try some house cocktails for each sure why not n nbut is this a place to frequent not at all well except phonys phonys will love this place holden however would hate it i have never been more impressed with the attention to detail dwayne and his wife put into the entire menu from the time you watch sarah mix your first drink you will realize this place is carefully thought out and time and effort is spent creating a jamacian experience that is authentic and delicious eat and drink your way through the menu and you will be amazed the color scheme and music representative of jamaica is amazing don t look for goat and only twice a month do you find oxtail stew but trust me na dissayah sinting a fee real nfor those of you for whom patois is not your first language please note the following you will feel like you are very much in an authentic jamaican environment minus the accent this place is cute and trendy i have one complaint really and that has to do with the value of the meal i ordered jerk chicken and literally ate a piece of chicken breast and paid about when i add the sweet potato pudding and sorrell no alcohol yes that means i was sober when i paid for that bit of protein nso if you really want some good jamaican knosh make friends with some real jamaicans mon ni also have to say that if you turn up early even five minutes early they will make you sweat it out in the hot arizona sun i am not sure why they dont let you wait inside but again now you know nbe careful to find a place that is safe to park at i parked behind the establishment after making sure that the space was kosher because there is a movement in the area to ticket as many people as it takes to buy a meal at breadfruit whew after months of being on the road going to the rum bar downtown for the promise of a perfect caribbean night is exactly what a gal needs to feel right at home n nwhen i entered the bar the vibe was really friendly and welcoming so i can tell right off the bat that i d enjoy the night ahead i started with the dark stormy a generous and sweet concoction of ginger beer and rum with a trail of mojitos the seafood was divine as well i tried out the mediterranean mussels and the spicy rum glazed shrimp that had me racing for another round of mojitos just to wash it down a must try a nice change from hipster food authentic meals and awesome drink menu do not let the rum menu scare you some of the best shrimp in the valley has a kick but worth the heat usually when you make reservations you expect to get in quicker but when we arrived of our party of were delayed in traffic imagine our surprise consternation when we were told we would not be seated until everyone was there the of us could have been ordering drinks enjoying appetizers oh well while waiting outside i observed quite a few people similarly waiting and many empty tables which didn t make sense to me so first off plan on being a tad irritated by the time you get to your table this would seem to be a major problem but in spite of all the reviews complaining of this bottleneck problem it continues n ni liked my meal but in my defense i must say i have never had jamaican cuisine before still i enjoyed it everyone at our table was happy with their food but it was a bit pricey and it was very noisy at our table conversation was almost impossible i don t know how that would work with that intimate scenario they are trying to create n nour waiter was excellent but he failed to mention the automatic gratuity added to all bills for parties of or more seems like he should have of course that might have cut back on his evenings haul n nall in all it was not such a relaxing evening when i think of jamaica i sure don t think of rigid rules and an unbending attitude toward life s little bumps and the phrase don t worry be happy never came to mind this was a great place three of us tried of the appetizers especially loved the fish pastry had the jerk chicken the scallops and the escovitch fish enjoyed several of the rums neat and on the rocks still love the zaya the best cute quaint relaxing on a tuesday night met and talked with the chef delightful place will definitely return for more hour long wait for food some of the menu items are a hit or miss this is not your authentic caribbean restaurant beautiful venue so we walk in and ask to sit on the patio in one of the open tables they say no the patio is only for groups of then they ask us if we have a reservation we say no and they ask us to wait to be seated even though the whole place was practically empty n nthen we get the menu and order mojitos the mojitos were small for but they had real spearmint good because the tap water tasted bad so i used it for my water which trust me you will need with the food n nthen we try to order but jerk options were unavailable and one pork chop option was replaced with quail so we go for the scallops appetizer the shredded pork jerk and the coconut curry n nwe asked for some bread while we waited they do a garlic bread appetizer not good the wait bothered my date a little because they served the people who walked in after us right away i didn t like that it was super freezing inside and really loud so i couldn t hear the waiter bad acoustics we managed to have some loud but good conversation over mojitos and convinced them to light our tea light for warmth comic relief n nthey play a lot of bob marley to make up for the bad acoustics otherwise we would definitely hear word for word everything being said n neventually food came it was presented really well but not easy to eat the scallops caused a histamine reaction right away for me not sure if it was the sauce maybe liquid smoke i m not allergic to sea food they serve a really cute palate cleanse in between courses n n i had trouble with the curry dish items cabbage didn t lend itself to be cut or as finger food the tofu was a change of pace sauce was mild rice super bland and tiny bit of candied plantain were super good n ni tried my date s sweet potato side and that was pretty mellow but my date got an upset stomach later had some pepto bismouth and his tongue turned scary black from the reaction of all the charcoal in the food and the bismouth in response to comments on this post we are aware bismouth can cause this reaction alone but it had not happened before the goal is to not need pepto bismouth after dinner n nwe had a nice time anyway that s how we roll but it was for both of us with tip and it just didn t seem worth it it s like they re trying to be something in l a or nyc no sf restaurant would act so pompous about seating although i did appreciate the local sourced food their deserts sounded fantastic so if i go back it will just be for desert i m with tracy i really like this place the layout is clean and simple the atmosphere super chilled the food fresh and tasty whenever i have business meetings at lunch i bring people to independent downtown eateries i feel its my duty to show them that our city is starting to bloom and everyone i have brought dug the food and the vibe n nbut the most important thing the owner dwayne is super friendly keen to hear feedback and eager to make his new restaurant work n nthat s a whole kind of refreshing in itself rum bar stands as one of the few places that transports you in terms of a cocktail lounge i still have not found a place downtown that rivals the way in which rum bar focuses on its handcrafted cocktails and creating an atmosphere that is seductively easy to find yourself chatting with other patrons while also ruminating on your own thoughts n ni had really written off rum in terms of my imbibing repertoire because it often is done too saccharinely sweet and violently colored meant to get club drunk rum bar wiped this away the progression of drinks and their sophistication in terms of flavor profiles and what they do to showcase the sheer diversity and variety of rum is uncanny and intoxicating the bartenders literally pull you into an experience that allows you to feel for a your short stint sipping that you might actually be shacked up in the caribbean n nin order to indulge in this experience it does demand that you spend more per cocktail but the quality is unparalleled that s why i suggest swinging by this place between pm to snag the happy hour remember the entire establishment creates intimacy and for that reason it easily gets filled fast and is better for not too large parties rolling through for the richness of rum reservations are key on busier nights and the small patio helps to only further the caribbean vibe n nalso not particularly a problem for me and actually a plus is the fact that for az it does have a dress code personally if you think you can wear a ripped muscle tee to an elevated boozing establishment you might be a little ridiculous to begin with aka no post gym fake post gym active wear sporting if you want a more casual atmosphere this would not be the choice for you it is carefree inducing but not casual by any means and therefore demands that you have to deal with some of the hangups and restrictions that come with this type of cocktail cruising i really love this place the craft cocktails are all wonderful it s hard to hold yourself back when you want to try them all as the name implies they only serve rum based drinks but the amount of thought that goes into every ingredient they add really makes them all shine speaking of rum if you re used to malibu captain morgan s and bacardi you re going to be surprised that there s a whole other world of amazing rums not like anything you find in a typical grocery store if you don t like rum you haven t been to rum bar the food is also really tasty most of it is pretty carb heavy but i ll break my diet to come here the jerk chicken is spicy and flavorful and if you re looking to splurge the lobster is excellent i try to come here at least once a week this was a lovely unique dining experience food was delicious and the staff was extremely attentive the ambiance was quaint and inviting we went on a date night there but would recommend for any experience if rum is your jam this is your spot extensive specially rum drink menu all paired with the dishes what a fun restaurant loved the big window with the candles the plantains were super good so was the spring roll with mango chutney our server was very friendly and recommended the curry chicken tofu which was a big hit highly recommend the hibiscus tea delicious a beer a piña colada a pre made punch cold scallops and a bowl of soup for you be the judge i am laid back guy and don t sweat the small stuff i took my wife here for her birthday along with party of other folks while at the bar attempting to order a drink the party was seated the bartender sam and african american host were so rude i did not order a drink and instead went to the table to order upon arriving there come to find out others at the table were complaining about how poorly they were being treated fyi rums there but no one knows how to make a drink they said they knew how to make rum and coke and i could have that if i wanted so ridiculous it s funny we couldn t wait to get our tab and go somewhere without the overpowering negative energy food is tasty but the bar is where its at best drinks and bartenders in town the breadfruit stars we ve dined here four times now the quality of the food is all over the place but usually settles on just being ok small portions for the price too i find the service staff to be uppity bordering on condescending i ve always walked away still hungry and unsatisfied i won t be dining there again nrum bar stars rum bar is in a different universe the bartending staff has always been friendly and helpful amazing selection of rums and imaginative cocktails oh yeah this place is unlike any other the absolute best rum drinks in the city when you hear rum bar don t think rum runners on spring break think about where don draper would want a glass of rum if he was in the caribbean nthe food his high quality jamaican the jerk sauce is so spicy and so good great place to take a date or a friend from out of town they also have cigars you can buy and smoke on the back patio if you re in to that sort of thing my husband jamaican and i were very excited to try the breadfruit especially after reading so many rave reviews sadly the best part of our experience and meal was the drink which turns this review into a star instead of n neven with a half empty dining room at pm on a weekday we were told they did not have a table available and had to wait half an hour at which point we were escorted into the now near empty dining room n nour appetizers and entrees were bland with only hints of jamaican flavors and served luke warm hubby had a upset stomach and touch of queasiness a couple hours after dinner n nthe concept of the restaurant is great but i recommend anyone visiting the breadfruit should go for happy hour and get the rum punch or other tasty cocktails and skip the food then you might not be disappointed i really wanted to like this place nwe arrived about minutes earlier than our friends and we waited about min to be seated in an empty place n nfirst we were greeted by a pretentious host who tried so hard to make it seem as this place was the most chic and expensive restaurant in new york city haha nope nwe asked to be seated on the front patio since it was empty and it was super nice out he quickly responded in a condescending way no patio is only reserved for dining are you dining i was already over this place at this point n nonce the host decided enough time had passed he came and took us to the back patio which is the smokers section we were not smoking we wanted to have a few drinks in a non smoking section but i guess here you don t get the option anyway it worked out after all since the place was empty n nthe host back here was nice and he did an ok job but we asked to get a few drinks and an appetizer and we were told we are not allowed to serve food back here i was already over the pretentious attitude of this place and now i was over all the rules they had nwe order drinks all the same and they only brought lol i mean this place was empty how can you forget drink out of n nthe drinks were meh the pretentious service was meh and the tacky uncomfortable patio set was meh this could be an amazing place if they would only stop pretending this is fine dining get rid of your host upfront and all your rules focus on making people comfortable and welcomed so they want to come back n ni will never be back here again so please don t waste your precious time and money we drank our meh drinks payed our bill and took our party to bliss rebar now this place was amazing drinks were great food is great and the service is frendly and welcoming boom that s what you want as a review so i wound up at the breadfruit with the yelp az international supper club my st time and glad i went look forward to many other eating adventures to come on a thursday night st off how come no one has written about the parking i m from chandler and don t go downtown that often and didn t bring change with me for the parking meters so wound up in a parking lot not too far from the restaurant and paid bucks for less than hours oh well i m putting it out their now bring change to feed the meters n ni have mixed feelings on the breadfruit and i ll explain the food which was good i enjoyed it and did eat it i think is little overpriced for example the pineapple upsidedown cake i order that was maybe bites was that was more than my pina colada come on now maybe they want you to drink to forget the prices lol also people were saying the size of the entrée dishes were small but for me it was perfect i think it s because we are so used to our plates being full of food that we forget what the right portion of food is but because of the price i am rating it stars for now n nthere were mussels for everyone to enjoy and if you are seafood person i bet they would have been for you i did try one the broth was delish the flavors omg so good the only thing that ruined it for me was the mussel but that s because i don t care for seafood so don t listen this part of my review haha n nmy friend and i ordered the plantain avocado spring rolls which were avocado ripe plantains baked in a wanton wrap paired with house mango chutney ok if you never had an avocado cooked then it would throw your taste buds for loop but for me this little appetizer was good and the mango chutney was a perfect paring didn t disappoint n ni ordered the jerk chicken off the grill i have been craving jerk chicken forever and this came with a slaw of sorts mango chutney grilled pineapple and a corn on the cobb that tasted like it was glazed in coconut omg so good i wish all corn on the cobb was like that the jerk chicken had great flavor and kick my taste buds were jumping i cut up a little piece and paired it with a piece of grilled pineapple mango chutney and it was party time like eyes rolling back good man that was great the little bread stick was a nice treat too little bit on the sweet side enjoyed it that was a perfect dish i would come back for that n nok so i wound up ordering desert which is something i rarely do but i was sold on the description of pineapple upside cake i love that stuff well i had high hopes for this cake it was a very small portion and it came with a steep price of if it was everything that had been described to me i think i would have been ok with the price but the cake was dry not as moist as i like it it had few pineapples on it and the glazed was only on the corner of the cake but that glazed was good i just wanted it to be more than what it was i think next time i will skip the desert and order another drink haha n nglad to have found the breadfruit and i bet i will be coming back for that jerk chicken soon i popped in here after walking around downtown and the smell was amazing i was already hungry walking in but the smell practically had me foaming at the mouth n ni sat down had a drink non alcoholic because it was a work day in minutes and my food arrived minutes later the server was super friendly with lots of suggestions tips she recommended a dish and i had the fish specialty escoviche it was super i got the impression that the jerk chicken is very spicy but with this dish the eater me can control the heat since it s served with chiles and chile oil on the side i ended up going all in with the chiles yum city n ni definitely want to go back and try some of the spicier food have a cocktail as well it seemed like they have a small but great selection of fresh juices and tasty rums to go well with the cuisine n nas a side note for anyone looking to go here it s in a great little spot of phx surrounded by other restaurants and it is close to the light rail for the lucky few who happen to live off that awesome mile stretch of public transportation if you go note that the place is tiny it seats maybe people tops but i think that quaintness adds to its charm love the drinks you can t find in your typical bars unique aromatic full of flavor and you get money worth highly recommend i had the tamarind delish wow i am so glad that i found this place the food was amazing we got the ceviche and the rainbow trout totally had the perfect amount of spice and flavor the rum punch of the day was also tasty as newbies to this neighborhood we will be back shout out to gabby our wonderful waitress who helped us through the drink and dinner menu if you want an experience that includes both food and drink pairings this is a winner this place was more than i could ve expected we visited this place during a visit to phx it was great from start to finish the service was great the server made all of the right recommendations drinks superb food great and the rum cake exploded with flavor in my mouth i will visit this place when i return words brown stew chicken i m a huge fan of jamaican food having a really good friend from the island that spoils me with authentic recipes that have passed down through generation in his family and traveling all over the world my palette is internationally known lol n nback to the story needless to say my taste buds were going crazy with expectation well dannng my girlfriend and i stood at the podium long enough to pull up yelp and read several mixed reviews since we had been noticed yet no one was coming over to greet us we started toward the empty bar with one guy seated and a totally empty lounge area when we noticed the sign please wait for server to be seared including the bar so we waited and waited and waited until someone anyone would make eye contact with us finally a waitress approached us and asked if we have a reservation i snickered like really my girlfriend said no we do not and she stated it would be a wait haha okaaaay so we waited only shortly though n nonce at the table we began browsing the drink menu in search of the jamaican rum wray nephew which they did so cool now as for the menu we both noticed the absence of jerk wings hmm we thought maybe we ll ask our server the server approached our table with a mouthful of the day s special selection and a great grasp of the menu very impressive so we ordered admiral s punch and some starters she had the roasted plantains with chutney dip and i had the baked mango fish rolls the plantains were soft not crisp and void of flavor as for my fish rolls they were pretty good but the fish was over cooked the drinks were a bit weak until we added shots of wray nephew n nso as we sat sipping a man stopped by our table and asked if we were enjoying our food we looked at each other and she asked why jerk wings weren t served on the starter menu the islander became very defensive explaining his island eats the whole bird not just part of it my girlfriend rebutted having spent a lot of time in jamaica feasting on local island cuisine as well as falling in love with the jerk wings wellll this stuck a nerve and to be quite honest i don t think he was expecting a real reply to his question just pretending to care n nneedless to say in life you meet some people that try so hard to upscale their image that they lose the true essence of their identity oh and he was rude because he kept wanting to rush off as if the place was packed lol n nwarning the only people that would be impressed by the food are those that have never truly experienced real jamaican cuisine and to think their philosophy our philosophy is that good food should be good to eat my point exactly nin case you re wondering the one star was for having actual jamaican rum had lunch here had the mango tea w mint fried plantain appetizer scallop appetizer and shrimp appetizer it was all very tasty the mango tea was excellent though the plantains were cooked perfectly with a little crisp on the edges and a little soft from grease in the middle the scallops were huge and tasted like there were fresh not frozen i didn t care for the shrimp and the peas they were ok just didn t do it for me there were some banana bread sticks that were included also a little rubbery but the flavor was dead on i d go back for dinner i appreciate the owner for taking a gamble on downtown phoenix and opening in a city where charm is as rare as good drivers the entrees are generally tasty and reasonably priced for example i have thoroughly enjoyed my jerk chicken both times that i have dined here similarly my dining partners have found their prawns and beef stew satisfactory n nthe intimate dining room with exposed brick lends a casual and laid back atmosphere service is attentive water glasses are always kept full and waitresses are very knowledgeable about the small menu n nso why did i not provide a fourth star two words dessert disaster i ordered the sweet potato pudding dessert and was presented with a slice of pudding that was about as wide and tall as two of my fingers and i m not a giant perhaps i could forgive the size if it were especially decadent but it was dry and not especially flavorful paying for a mediocre sliver of sweet potato pudding hurt me in the value department especially considering that my large entree itself was under n nin general this restaurant has a lot going for it however the food seems to be the issue that is leading most reviewers myself included to not rate it as highly as we would hope we could if the owner is reading this review i suggest he or she consider making some minor revisions to the menu a restaurant cannot survive if it is only respected for its charming building or place the quality and value of the food must equal the surroundings in its ability to satisfy customers classic mojito plantain and avocado spring rolls fred s jerk chicken sandwich french press coffee shared with sweet potato pie a la mode plus exemplary service with a smile by holly n ncozy den perfect for a date or just catching up with a friend my partner in crime and i shot the crap for hours and never once were we given any indication that it was anything less than completely cool n nthat s how you do it breadfruit good on you n nside note i don t even particularly like rum phoenix needs more restaurants in downtown and preferably more like the breadfruit n nthe food was innovative and fresh and the staff was helpful and gracious our first course was the jerk scallops and they were delicious for my main course i had the chicken in a dark caribbean sauce and it was amazing my friend had the mussels and he loved them n nnow lets talk about the drinks actually just have some and talk later i would suggest asking your waiter or waitress for a full review they will not steer you wrong n nthe next time i m in phoenix i will visit the breadfruit perfection so i was really excited to check out this place when i visited phoenix at the end of july went straight there from the airport love the swanky hole in the wall that phoenix seems to have a niche in our server was very nice and the drinks were great but now the disappointment begins appleton rum sea scallops app was pretty good couls have used more flavor but what s awful was there were only and our food took forever not worth it they should definitely change this into a main dish add scallops more seasoning rice and increase the price to make it worth it i ordered the pork with polenta and it was boring my friend ordered something else dont remember what but she wasn t thrilled either so i recommend this place maybe for a happy hour but for dinner s there is better out there if you re looking for carribean food downtown i suggest ticoz such a regret the host treated us as were an unconvinced to this restaurant negative behavior from all the staff and restrictions all the way my friends group of walked to the bar and asked for a drink the host moved us to the patio because we didn t had a reservation we were the only ones at the patio and it took min for a waitress to come out and take our order awesome this little quaint place was right up our alley fresh cocktails and a delicious food the jerk chicken never disappoints but the service kitchen is kind of slow nalso tried the curry coconut tofu dish flavor was good but the tofu was a strange texture a friend ordered the pork belly and unfortunately they were out so she had the jerk pork and was pleased as well each time i have been there they have been out of at least one dish which is unfortunate ndespite the service and them running out of certain dishes i will continue to patronize the place because i think the food is really good i had a friend another jamaican with a couple of hours layover in phoenix so i picked him up and headed to this restaurant as it seemed the closest to the airport the staff was very friendly and we didn t have to wait too long for service i have to admit this small establishment was just about on of the fanciest of the jamaican restaurants i have visited in north america this doesn t usually bode well with me because from my personal experience the fancier the restaurant the more they stray from the authenticity of the cuisine by trying to please the american palate nwe eschewed the nouvelle cuisine menu items obvious there to please that crowd and ordered the escovitch fish and jerk chicken since my favourite ox tail was nowhere on the menu and that is the dish most jamaicans use to test the excellence of our restaurants i guess it doesn t ring well in a fancy place anyway as a kingstonian i am used to going to a beach area where they cook up the best escovitch fish corned with country pepper habanero and onions and dripping with grease but just finger licking good that was not the case here but it was a darn righ better that i could have whipped up in my kitchen at home i think most americans will probably enjoy it but i will wait until i am back home or at a greasy spoon in brooklyn or one of the many florida cities with large jamaican communities the jerk chicken was also nothing like you would get back home but exotic enough for vacationers to the island needing a bit of nostalgia the rice and peas was missing something i am not sure what exactly but suspect it didn t have any coconut milk or not enough anyway i have other jamaican friends who have enjoyed other dishes here so i have not given up yet and plan to return and sample a few other dishes i have been craving breadfruit roast or friend so i hope i wont be disappointed went to dinner here with some girlfriends during a weekend reunion in phoenix we started off with some delicious rum drinks at the bar while waiting the minutes for a table i had a great dark stormy n nthe coconut curried tofu with rice ripe plantains and veggies was fabulous but there were only a few plantains per plate n nif you wish to converse it s best not to go on the weekends when the rum bar is busy n noverall this is an intimate great bar and restaurant the drinks are strong the decor is wonderful the food is great and the serve is prompt ugh nwaitress was not terribly flexible with food and drink orders ni asked for a mojito with less simple syrup and she said the mix is already made with syrup ni asked the bartender separately and he said ok no problem ni asked for the modified mojito nshe stated that the bartender misunderstood me nit s a f ing bar napparently the drink menu is fixed nno mixology at this place more like fixedology n nif hungry do not order the lamb chops the portion of two tiny chops was just silly n nhopefully management reads this and makes changes if i could review the drinks separately from the food i would give the rum bar stars the drinks and the myriad of rum choices are awesome i think they have something like varieties of rum yum plus i love me some island like drinks however seeing that i can t review one without the other i have to give rum bar only stars due to the food which is bleh at best n ni should probably add my disclaimer now i am from the bronx ny and have been eating authentic jamaican food my entire life so my expectations may be a bit higher than someone whose never really had the real deal now that that s done on to my review n ni tried the breadfruit when it first opened up a few years ago and wasn t impressed with the food then their beef patty was this square shaped thing that was nothing like the true beef patties that i get from the jamaican bakeries when i m at home in the bronx i can t even remember what else i had which speaks to the memorability of this food soooooo fast forward to october my girlfriend had a birthday gathering at the rum bar which is how i ended up there i was mainly drinking and only wanted a little something to have on my stomach you true drinkers know what i mean so i just got an order of plantains and even those were on the dry side like they had been overcooked a bit n ni will definitely hit up the rum bar again for the cocktails but i ll make i sure i eat before i go this place has potential good ambience and location adorable bathroom sink but our waitress was rude condescending and the drinks were over priced i tried this place out for the first time with a party of seven this last first friday the food was to die for if you don t like spicy food you should tell them but i got the jerk chicken and it was perfectly cooked and amazingly seasoned my friend got the scallops and they were probably the best i ve had in phoenix we had to wait a while for our table not surprised since we had a large group and it was friday night but they had a a live band playing in the back a great seating area to wait in and a great drink list even though i don t really like rum i will definitely be coming back honestly i love the food and drink but i m beyond tired of the rude hostess and servers that i ve encountered on several occasions the breadfruit has a great decor and location and is a perfect spot for tasty cocktails but if you are looking for dinner the breadfrult is a disappointment as others have noted there is no host of any kind so even with a reservation you stand around awkwardly waiting to be seated by someone the food has good spice but i found dishes way too sweet and portions are astoundingly tiny on the whole the jerk chicken was the exception tasty and well proportioned with tasty beans and rice i hope they work on the hosting and tweak the menu a bit because the decor is lovely and you can tell the place is a labor of love i think breadfruit is a wonderful little jamaican restaraunt the dishes are unique and wondefully flavorful the place is small but that just adds to the air of intimacy the kitchen is close and within view the wait staff is extremely knowledgable friendly and ready with a great and candid assesment of what s great on the menu that day and what s not the cocunut carrot juice drinks are absolutely amazing i think this spot is best as an off downtown lunch spot as it can get pretty crowed and hence uncomfortable during week end evenings i definitely give it an enthusiastic recommendation and am certain you will love the food every aspect of dining is worth the cost the service food and ambiance are all wonderful my favorites include the jerked scallops with sautéed veggies and the mussels i also love the carrot juice and the coffee the breadfruit is a great place for special occasions the fact that this restaurant and golden corral both get the same rating as a crime against humanity this restaurant is rather small amazing selection of rum the swordfish is fantastic the jerk pork is incredible the shrimp are amazing i ve never had anything there that i didn t love except maybe dessert but i m not big i dessert the wait staff is terrific it s a fun environment if you have not been to this restaurant i strongly recommend it if i lived in phoenix i go every week the place seems to be getting a devoted crowd so call ahead for reservations if you do enjoy rum the rum flights are fantastic and give you a chance to try things that you probably would never try any other way i wish i could rate our server separately because she was amazing and deserves stars drinks were fantastic without a doubt however the entire experience was disappointing there seems to be an air of impatience and annoyance at customers coming from most of the staff especially from a gentleman who i believe was managing i am writing this review because i just can t believe how poor our overall experience was definitely won t be investing my time and money coming back to this place if you want to impress a date this is the place to start the ambiance is classy and yet cozy we indulged once upon a night and had the hot buttered rum as well as other creative run cocktails n nthe food is excellent but what really made me comfortable was the service our server was knowledgable attentive and professional i liked that he wasn t interrupting our conversation and asking every minutes if everything was ok or if we needed a refill so many restaurants make it difficult to enjoy a peaceful evening with constant interruptions n nwe will definitely return last night i went with a group of friends for our yelp international supper club meeting the breadfruit truly does transport one to the beaches of jamaica the atmosphere is very intimate and relaxed with soft music playing in the background and little white candles lining the window frames for appetizers i had the plantain avocado spring rolls and the pimento wood smoked mussels the rolls paired really well with the mango chutney that they were paired with but the texture inside the roll was a little too mushy for me the roll itself was crunchy but i wish there was some type of nut inside to break the monotony i couldn t resist ordering a mai tai which was absolutely delicious my entrée was the red stripe curried prawns the prawns were in fact amazing and served with rice beans plantains and bell peppers for dessert i had the pineapple upside down cake but the only thing that was upside down was my smile when i tasted this tiny dry sad excuse of a dessert for i expected that dessert to knock off my heels and round out a fantastic food evening some things to note they will not split bills nightmare for a party of parking is either by meter or pay lot restroom is uni sex with the toilet directly facing the urinal ughh gross overall the most food was really good and unique the prices are just a little too high for the portion size the best i ve tried so far this week i ve eaten at five different restaurants prior i m out of town really nice service without being overwhelming responsive staff i sat at the bar the place is really cute and intimate ambiance is perfect i came alone and enjoyed the experience so well the bar tenders are artists and care about the drinks i really like that food came at a great pace loved my soup and pork belly also had dark and stormy which was perfect this place is great we went here as a part of my brithday bar crawl we showed up as a party of with no notice on a friday night and they got us seated pretty quickly i do recommend though making a reservation or calling ahead if you plan on taking a larger party as it is a pretty small place it was an unexpected stop on our tour though the rum drinks are amazing our server was very knowledgeable and made great suggestions for everyone at the table who had questions i had a hemingway daiquiri which is one of my favorites and it was excellent too spicy too not i wish i could find a middle ground for it all all the rum in the world cannot the essence of jamaican flare for food eating in the bar is for the brave only as you will be tossed and turned while eating plan ahead on a weekend and make a reservation this is one of the best if not the only place to try every rum from the caribbean in the valley they have highly skilled bartenders and a rotating cocktail menu i d recommend one of their classics like a rum old fashion or dark and stormy they also have more exotic drinks like a trade wind swizzle n nif the rum alone isn t enough to consider this spot as a must try the food is fantastic as well i recommend the jerk chicken most of all n ngo in say hello to dwayne and enjoy yourself went early during first friday last week and scored a spot at the bar thank god for that because this place was tiny and i wouldn t recommend it for groups n nhaving said that we ordered whatever the bartender suggested different drinks in all and found them all to be outstanding we would ve liked to try some of their rums but there was no help offered figuring out how to sample those it s a bit overwhelming n nthe nice thing is that you can order food from the adjoining restaurant however the jerk spice on the perfectly cooked scallops was so spicy that i could not eat it food and service is great i love their drinks and the ambience it is overall very pricey and sometimes a little overpriced i only go there when i have to spend in one sitting absolutely amazing swanky classy delectable body rubbable and so much more love the drinks very refreshing love the food very fresh and flavorful i will definitely go back n nhowever get rid of the double standard for dress code if men can t wear a sleeveless shirt then neither should the women and by the way this is arizona and degrees this was our first time to breadfruit i was really impressed the service was impeccable and the food excellent in an intimate but colorful space a really nice date night this place is special in my heart their quality value and pride do not budge if you do not get it or like it it has got to be based on your lack of knowledge and palette a unique bar in any major city in the known world it has one of the most legit expensive cocktails in the united states their is extreme value as the quality of the food is fine dining there is no way to mirror the drinks as the essences and bitters are made in house you can pick up in suttlties in every bite as there is always something new to be discovered the amount of knowledge between the chef and head bartender whom are both owners and have the courage to put their name on their own place is unmatched by any point in recordable history as it would be impossible for any chef nor bartender in the past based on modern communication technology to have such a vast range of flavors with such an acute delivery i am positive if you didn t enjoy yourself here you were too drunk and they were worried about your safety you were extremely rude as their employees are not slaves your lack of tact offended other tactful guests and you were asked to leave or you simply want to be cheap and think complaining will make them lower their quality their menu is ever changing i have worked at plus bars in restaurants in two major cities i possess years in the industry and offer no favors to anyone this is the perfect place for multiple courses during a date you re guaranteed to impress a great place to splurge or have a quick two courses with a cocktail or two within the bar there is high quality rum and rum that will never be available to the world again two years ago i couldn t stand rum and now i want to be jamaican clean and trustworthy if you made an ass of yourself before you need not worry as this place holds no grudges so long as you mind your manners the carrot juice is amazing everything is organic and thoughtfully purchased and produced the veggie meals are incredible and the deserts are to die for totally worth it happy hour for drinks nice ambience and super customer service and salt fish fritter i didn t give star due to not trying actual food but great overall very impressed by the level of service and food everything had such flavor and a little taste if jamaica in every bite truly a must when you re in town we went to breadfruit last night for a saturday dinner when we got there there were two other couples on the place but it filled up while we were eating which means two other parties sat down the place is lovely and tiny n nour waiter owner not sure was extremely enthusiastic about the menu and the special appetizer of the day which was jerk scallops he really wanted us to order them well fine i love scallops so why not and they were excellent my only complaint there were two scallops and they cost more than each of our meals had i known that ahead of time and no i didn t ask i wouldn t have ordered them but it s a small complaint n nthe food everything was very tasty i ordered the brown chicken stew and dh ordered the jerk chicken and he even liked the mango salsa that came with it he usually scrapes all strange and exotic food items to the side of his plate n nwe also had the avocado plantain rolls for appetizers and they were great the special drinks are also quite delicious n nthe place is clean bright and fun i would definitely go again to sample some other menu items i finally had the opportunity to check out this place along with some fellow yelpers this past thursday international supper club fun the place is small and very quaint think of cute but kinda expensive date night let me start off by saying that although the food was good the price didn t quite match the portions n ni started off with the the pina colada as my drink of the night which was shaken and not blended very good i will say that the drinks are worth the price it was but it was good and strong so one was plenty the mussels that were ordered for the table were quite good it did have the smokey flavor and the broth that was left was good for dipping the bread in good eats n ni next ordered the oven roasted plantains for my appetizer which were very good however i received slices and it cost or roughly per slice plantains themselves before cooking are a decent size however the slices i received were just a normal small slice you would get at any restaurant that has them as an appetizer i have had plantains at other places and received much more and the cost was much less n nfor my main course i ordered scallops you receive average size scallops and a side of rice and peas the scallops were good but i am not sure that they were good maybe they were nice and spicy and they did melt in your mouth but other than that there was nothing extra special about them n nsome people ordered dessert and i knew that it was going to be bad not the dessert but the cost of the dessert and the portion they received didn t match one bit for the smallest piece of upside pineapple cake i have ever seen maybe but the fact that it cost more than our drinks yowza although everyone seemed pretty pleased with their meals they were a little surprised by how much everything cost in comparison to the portions i am not asking for some huge over the top portion but still this place is not frou frou enough to charge what they charge great chicken curry patties unfortunately it looks like they re off the menu all i see are spinach and tilapia patties coco bread was buttery pretty tasty and i loved its texture and it too looks like it s off the menu for a side of steamed veggies was a joke i kid you not i saw one cabbage leaf one very thin slice of tomato and one ultra thin sliced ring of red bell pepper honestly i didn t think it was possible to slice something that thin ah one word mandolin all served on a teacup plate i felt so ripped off n nrestroom was clean and so was the rest of the restaurant had dinner at the breadfruit rum bar this evening with a special friend i googled best seafood restaurant in downtown phoenix and they appeared she loves seafood so there we went the staff is extra attentive very up to speed on the ingredients and it s clear the chef takes pride in quality and details i m vegan and finding something was easy and it was delicious dwayne taylor tamra mila and javier were outstanding from walking in to being seated to answering every question offering multiple recommendations all good and the energy is very positive the owner dwayne said they re going on years i ve only been here months but i m mad i didn t hear about it sooner a must dine if you haven t already done so cocktails were very good food was also good however plates were small for the prices overall loved it sitting at the bar is the best spot my new favorite place the mixologists take their craft seriously and each cocktail is a work of art they make their own syrups no bottled mixes here appreciate the authentic reggae music playing in the background and the beautiful ambiance a relaxed but higher end establishment in addition an intimate outdoor back patio with tropical island feel and lots of humidity pumping through the misters for cigar smoking cigars sold there as well ahhhh breadfruit where do i begin with your delicious cocktails your fun and happenin atmosphere i wish that s where this review was going but alas i left your establishment with a bad taste in my mouth n nlet me begin by saying this was a solid stars maybe even before i got my bill the special fish sounded great and after craig went on and on about how they have their own fish monger and how the fish is flown in daily and yadda yadda yadda how could i resist the fish was good the portion was ridiculously small and the accoutrement were completely forgettable so riddle me this how is it that on a menu where no item is more than bucks all items very well priced by the way that the special fish is f ing dollars i mean if you have a special that is more than twice most of the entree s on your menu you best inform the customer i was not pleased to receive my bill and discover that little surprise on the check seriously had the fish been priced closer to the rest of the entree s the anger i am spewing currently would be much less vitriolic n nadditionally the accoutrement grilled pineapple ok i get it it s sweet deep fried bread wtf you could lash these bastards together and float back to jamaica on em and coleslaw that is obviously meant as a garnish and not to be eaten give me a freakin break n nthe red beans and rice were whatever my wife s jerk chicken was dry and needed that chutney to be at all edible and the meal itself was completely forgettable tack on the not so great souffle that craig talked us into and the more i ve thought about my dining experience at breadfruit the more pissed off i am i m bucks lighter entrees drinks desert and tip sure sure it was my fault for ordering all that but c mon man i mean really n ni will return to this fun and drinkably tasty locale again for perhaps appetizers and drinks most definitely the drinks and the atmosphere when i m in the downtown area but i will here for to pass on further dining experiences the rum bar was such a neat little bar down town but if you don t like rum this is not your place they only serve red stripe or rum but what a collection i liked the vibe of the place very chill and a nice patio as well the servers were really personable and knowledgable i was fascinated watching them make their drinks with all the tincture and exotic ingredients felt very sophisticated what do you say when you discover a wonderful restaurant tell others accidentally ran across this gem last night on edge of downtown phoenix and had fantastic dinner and drinks menu emphasizes fresh seafood but i was lucky to be there one of the evenings each month when they have their special succulent braised oxtail marinated overnight in jamaican flavors and cooked slowly for most of the day then served with rice and perfect mix of grilled fresh summer pattypan squash with sauteed eggplant and olives an outstanding dessert of chocolate cake with center of molten chocolate rum and side of real whipped cream amazing bar with over rums served up lively pomegranate lime mint mojito hot ginger mint tea was served as chunks of fresh ginger and mint leaves under hot water in a french press tea as it was meant to be professional friendly staff moderate prices and local artists works on the walls make this a great evening and great deal not many jamaican restaurants around so our group thought it sounded interesting we had a reservation for p m on a saturday night which was confirmed the day before and they told us they were going to place us at the high top table in the bar we arrived on time and the restaurant was crowded we noticed there was another group seated at our table we were a little annoyed that we had to wait minutes until this group left and they cleared the table there was no apology no explanation my friend who only drinks vodka was not happy that they only had rum and wine the food was alright but no one in the group was raving about any of it and it was pricey i ve been to breadfruit a couple of times now my most recent experience was in the last hours with a couple of friends i should start this review my noting that i love jamaican food in general i love foods that mix fruity and spicy and yet aren t too heavy on the stomach n nfor the food the coleslaw and corn are excellent side items the bread is decent and interesting flavour though a bit on the tough side for main dishes i have had the jerk chicken and jerk prawns indeed for me the jerk chicken was the better the shrimp was not filling at all for prawns is not only a rip off for a restaurant that serves with paper napkins but it leaves you wanting more in a bad way the plantain and avocado rolls are perhaps the only thing on the menu worth the price they are perfectly paired with the mango chutney the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well the waiter might have done well by us to mention that the half order for had only medium sized scallops for you could get the full order but then what s the point also at the table was a house salad of sorts which while it has potential went half eaten n nalso a plus they have finally gotten a beer license so they can finally serve appropriately jamaican red stripe lager at it isn t the best deal in downtown phoenix though nickel and dimed again n nas for the service and management there are not positive signs for this restaurant it has managed to stay in business and good on them on the other hand while the décor is nice and pleasant typical jamaican with it s yellow and green walls the place is noisy and that is odd considering we were the only three patrons in the restaurant management would do well to put up a plexiglass room divider the restaurant does have a nice glass façade which allows a pleasant view of the street unfortunately the location is on st and pierce which offers some of the worst views in all of downtown phoenix alas this location goes to waste it really is impressive that the place hasn t closed down my last impression is of the wait staff while the staff two years ago was helpful and polite we three agreed that the new staff was pushy and unhelpful over and over we were pushed to order items we insisted we didn t want and when it came to selling us on the dishes and informing us of the small skewer of prawns or the scallop appetizer he seemed to have forgotten i guess it s a bit like a used car salesman n ntoo bad i can t think of another jamaican restaurant in phoenix i d love to try it next time sat at the bar for cocktails and dessert love their selection of run concoctions had the rum cake will go back for dinner what a disappointment treatment awful came all the way from northern california our phoenix hosts were very excited to treat us to dinner at a jamaican restaurant he left work picked up his year old and met his wife and us his out of town guests at the restaurant we were wondering if they would have food for the year old who has some food allergies and would have understood if they did not what we did not understand was the treatment we got when we inquired we were told the chef does not adjust any recipes okay fine but we weren t prepared when the help was joined by what appeared to be owner and or manager who proceeded to say they are an adult restaurant and they seldom get kids in the restaurant in a very condescending manner i was shocked at the tone and could not believe it what about service what about a nice welcome wish we could accommodate you but we were a party of adults the dad was willing to take his year old and feed him elsewhere but the cold and callous way we were treated make that place not worthy of one star just my opinion definitely don t take kids to their adult restaurant and don t ask for any deviation from the cooking of the menu per the help the chef will not make changes to his menu came in a few times before and ordered drinks with dinner the trick to liking this place is to order drinks at the counter that was you get to see the giant hunk of ginger see the bar tenders squeezing limes watch them actuallly muddle drinks with care the drinks are good but the show even better this isn t your normal cafe n nthese people understand the taste of the caribbean and after a meal or two you will also everything seems to be on the spicy side something i like but might not be for everyone great flavors amazing smells and the cocktails might just be some of the best you will ever have n nyou owe it to yourself to give it a try there are very few places around downtown to have a drink and cigar but this is one of them stocked by churchill s cigars a local cigar shop rum bar has a reasonable selection of about eight or ten cigars and a bar full of rum and a mixologist to go with it if you re into rum drinks this is also one of the best spots in town to get one n nthere are definitely a handful of shops in the area you can pick up a cigar but none of them are open past or pm and none of them will serve you a cocktail while you smoke when i m out with the pals and in the mood for a cigar it s generally not before pm you ve got to have a bit of forethought for that and i m rarely blamed for foreword thinking that s for sure sure the drinks are premium priced and the cigars too but this is the spot when you re looking to pair them up n nnote that smoking is only on their outdoor patio and not in an inside lounge it would be nice to find a spot with an inside smoking lounge in the downtown area but beggars can t be choosers right n nhappy yelping phoenix see you around downtown very disappointed with this restaurant planned to meet friends for dinner so i called breadfruit on wednesday to make a reservation for saturday evening at we arrived on time and the restaurant had no record of my reservation they told us that they couldn t give us a table for over an hour we left and had a nice dinner at another restaurant delicious island food that is served by cooks on island time come well before you are hungry if you like rude slow service and dry mediocre over priced food then this is your place nso much potential great location and cute restaurant but the food and service needs help nps not kid friendly it was girls night out dinner before going to see chelsea handler perform at comerica theatre n nfirst thought as we entered was the place was quaint clean good music and empty we were the second table to be sat for dinner at n nwe ordered drinks all rum by the way a couple of the gals were shocked that a rum bar didn t serve vodka so we were off to a great start my mojito ponganot was amazing and that is the only good thing i have left to say about this place n nwe ordered appetizers the oven roasted plantains just meh and we also ordered the fresh baked patty one tilapia and one spinach i thought the crust was a bit on the dry side two of us thought they were good good enough to order another one which ended up never being served to us n nthe major disappointment was the one entree that we made this trip for was sold out hmmm we were the second table to be seated the other table hadn t ordered yet and what is it you ask that they sold out of why the popcho sweet ginger basically baby bok choy wow now that is an ingredient you can t find oh i don t know everywhere n nwe ended up eating salads which were good fresh but frankly could have made just as easily at home the bread that was offered and not on menu and therefore assumed to come with the meal was breadsticks with a hint of vanilla good but sticks for almost no thanks n nthe kicker was when we asked them to call us a cab we sat for minutes and nothing we asked again and finally this time saw them pick up a phone we were then told we could sit outside to free up the table this was after paying our tab i have never had this occur at a restaurant yes i know it was a friday night but we were finishing our drinks we had paid and tipped well and think that they could afford to have us sit there for minutes waiting on a cab they forgot to call n ni might have returned even based on the lackluster food just for the drink but i can certainly say after the rudeness we would never return drinks on point good fantastic ambiance wonderful service was excellent can be a little to formal but i holding them back great spot owners should be proud of their business will go back and tell others three words n n hot buttered rum n noh emm gee food was really good here i like the atmosphere but was not a fan of some of the seating spots one right next to the bathroom yuk luckily a new table came up and we moved the mojitos were excellent scallops were good but almost too spicy the tofu curry was awesome and the jerk pork and polenta was good i wish had a little more depth though but the okra was a good addition to it maybe a few more would have been nice our waitress was good but seemed very stressed out or frustrated which was clear notherwise a good spot very cozy and i think i will try it again i am totally irie after tonight s dinner at the breadfruit what a great little gem in phoenix the lady of the house and i went as i d been following the place on yelp and seeing the great reviews in the local papers n ni m familiar with island food having spent my high school years in florida during a period of much emigration from haiti jamaica and the other islands it was a real pleasure to see the classics presented in a modern setting n nthe breadfruit just got their liquor license normally we don t start with cocktails but the drinks menu looked amazing i chose my favorite carrot juice which is made with carrot juice coconut milk vanilla and more loved it the lady had the sorrel and later the pink ting she loved it n nwe started with their perfect appleton rum sea scallops and a spinach patty the scallops were cooked just right and were on the money with regard to spice the spinach patty is such a basic thing really delicate with some unexpected savory taste n nshe had curried chicken and dumpling superb the whole wheat dumpling was unexpected and had a thick bit to it the go alongs were cabbage green banana and plantains i got to taste most of it and found it to be perfect island comfort food n ni had the estovich fish and festival tonight s fish was red snapper which i love they used their jerk rub to heat it up and put the estovich on the side good move as you can heat it up scotch bonnet style as much as you d like this came with grilled pineapple coleslaw and one festival said corn on the menu but it never came n nservice was superb our server jason asked if it was our first time and where we d heard of them when i said yelp he quickly jotted this on the order pad this waiter was great at anticipating our questions and explaining the menu goodup guy as the jamaicans say the breadfruit and rumbar has been serving downtown phoenix patrons tasty jamaican food since but i finally checked it out for the first time this past weekend i fell in love with it instantly and can t wait to go back n nthe breadfruit and rumbar is a charming jamaican eatery with an extensive selection of more than rums i had one of my new favorite cocktails there the changing daily punch bowl special made with fresh pomegranate and cranberry juices it was so refreshing plus pretty strong and i could have sipped them all night long and if you re into cigars you can purchase one there to pair with your rum too n nwe started with the plantain avocado spring rolls paired with a mango chutney if you like the avocado rolls at kona grill you ll definitely like these and it s nice to know the breadfruit locally sources all their menu items so everything is extremely fresh n ni m usually not a huge tofu fan but i took the recommendation of our server to order the coconut curry tofu it was a really hearty delicious dish and the tofu reminded me of chicken bits i really liked it the rice and beans they re called peas on the menu was my favorite part of the dish which also came with veggies and plantains it was a great variety of foods and really filling i d highly recommend it n nmy boyfriend got the jerk chicken which he said was the best jerk chicken he d ever had n nbesides the tasty food the atmosphere at the breadfruit was so pretty the lounge area was dark and sophisticated you won t find any sports televisions and the main dining room was small and cozy service was excellent and i d recommend it as a great date place i wish there were more stars to give this place is amazing the scallops are some of the best scallops i have had anywhere i just wish they would bring back the entrée version the pork belly is to die for as well now let us talk about the rums with over a to choose from you will not be let down although rum is not normally my choice in spirits the dark and stormy here gets me every time the homemade ginger beer is delicious even though we don t live in phoenix anymore anytime we visit we make it to breadfruit definitely make a reservation as they are always busy this is my double review n nmy wife and i participate in a monthly dinner club with a small group of couples we go in alphabetical order and each couple gets to pick a spot for dinner basically twice per year after doing a date night at breadfruit not too long ago we decided to make this the spot for our month and we all descended upon breadfruit n nso this friends is the tale of two visits stars for our date night for sure my girlfriend and i ubered it that night so indulged in what i might call a wonderfully intoxicating evening the selection of rums at breadfruit and duh rum bar is nothing short of amazing in fact they do a fine job of proving that you can make just about anything with rum n ni was fortunate to have sealed the deal with lucrative new client at work that week as well so i treated us to a couple of glasses of per shot appleton estate rum i must say my girlfriend was so smitten with my confident seemingly incredible knowledge of rums that she accepted my marriage proposal n nok ok that last part was mostly fantasy we did get engaged and married since that date night but it s not because i m a rum expert i m not it s not because i can afford a couple of shots of rare rum either i can t regardless try the rum cocktails and if you won the powerball or are just having a great day try some of the pricier rums you ve never heard of before n nof course date night included a wonderful meal at a small table for two as well love the atmosphere and love the food we were seated promptly shared a small plate a couple of entrees and desert and it was all delicious we had lots of leftovers to enjoy later n n nour dinner club was mostly the same story we had some confusion when we arrived though the restaurant is small there s a small bar near the entrance with a waiting area lounge and one long table which ended up being where our party was seated for dinner then there s the dining room which is not much larger and straight out from the back of the bar is a nice patio with a waterfall some heaters and booth areas sort of has a loungy feel outside breadfruit also has a nice selection of cigars and this is where you can enjoy them n nthe two of us enjoyed a cocktail outside while we waited for our table to be prepared then were seated for dinner as the rest of our table arrived but you can t just go out onto the patio yourself you have to be seated out there as well so it was a bit much for the hostess to first prepare a table for us outside while also preparing a table for us inside we misunderstood some of the things she said as well and it was confusing at first when we began to follow her to one place or another because we thought we were supposed to but were then told to go back up front and wait then be shuttled out back then be shuttled back inside to our dinner table n ni again very much enjoyed my dinner kimberly and i shared the salt fish fritters nothing short of awesome and i had the pimiento wood jerk chicken which was half a game hen it was rubbed with a house jerk seasoning and it was absolutely delicious n ni d probably give the dinner club visit stars because of the confusion up front but in my opinion the food and drink were once again top notch so i m leaving my tale of two visits as a star review enjoy breadfruit the breadfruit was amazing a little on the expensive side for dinner for drinks each and an app but it is worth every penny service was great drinks were some of the best i have ever had and jerk chicken was so tasty we will be back i am absolutely amazed people actually like this place i went in with my mother and girlfriend and also a few family friends a few weeks back and decided to write today as i still can not get over the awful food and service i honestly would not have cared so much about the service if the food was actually good although it was terrible when we moved from the bar to the restaurant side we were the only customers they had as there were seven of us when a friend that lived in the area stopped by the waitress made a huge deal about adding one more person and was rude to both my mother and her friend the waitress and staff in general had an attitude that they were better and we should be happy to eat in their establishment we are all professionals and were dressed as such after working a full day the drinks were overpriced and terrible chicken was burnt portions were small and gross everything was overpriced i would not recommend this place to anyone i m usually very satisfied with my dining experience here this time the conch dinner entree was not good i thought i d try something different and i love muscle type food ie calamari clams but this dish had no flavor whatsoever the flavors are why i go here everything else was wonderful but trust me do not order this dish i made reservations here for my birthday for a party of on a monday for the patio my party and i show up and the host seems like he can barely force a smile out he indicates our table is set up inside to which i reply i had made a reservation for the patio i am still incredulous at his response when he says that can t be accommodated because they didn t know this is their oversight and not even the slightest notion to correct this all the meanwhile the patio and restaurant in general have a total nof tables wow n nmy friends can see i am a bit shocked and bummed so they chime in that it is my birthday and can t something be done to accommodate us on this special occasion nope literally got a sneer from the host in response so our only option is to accept this table inside where the smell of old seafood seems to linger oh and i forgot to mention that we were missing one person so our party couldn t be seated right away remember there are only other tables occupied and no wait again wow n nso we sidle up to the empty bar to wait and the bartender who actually seems very friendly offers us the drink special for the evening one of my friends asks to sample this and our bartender extremely hesitantly pours her a sip i do not blame him for this hesitation since i am sure management influenced this with the less than accommodating environment they foster at this point we haven t even been sat and it is a dining experience from my worst dreams albeit on the day i want to celebrate with my close friends i call it a wrap and we bounce out of there and celebrate at cibo instead n ngive me a break breadfruit not even michelin star restaurants feel like they have the posterity to treat their customers this way i will not return and will certainly discourage people from dining at your establishment over priced and not that good liked the setting but the food really was not up to par had the scallops lobster and fresh fish of the day n nlobster was very very small and way over cooked the fresh fish was not so fresh and was burned not blackened but honestly burned n nonly redeeming factor was the cocktails sorry guys i don t intend to return but based on the way we were treated by the kitchen earlier this week my uncouth self doesn t exactly feel welcome anyway however i m not quite convinced that it s my loss n nit had been almost a year since my original visit to breadfruit which did not overwhelm as you can judge by it taking me a year to make it back but i did have an appreciation of the option for caribbean cuisine n nsince a friend and i were going to be downtown for an event i suggested breadfruit for our dinner spot we enjoy good food and supporting local the option to pick up wine at the public market next door and have the already reasonable corkage fee waived was a bonus as we had really enjoyed a couple of the arizona stronghold wines at a recent fnb wine pairing and thought they would pair well with the jamaican heat n nwhile the scallops were delicious and cooked perfectly for per scallop is a tad steep in my book we also shared the jerk chicken salad and the jerk prawns off the grill n nhere s the ultimate rub the bottom of the menu states no substitutions or modifications since when is cutting a kfc side sized ear of corn a modification n nat the same time the menu describes the restaurant and it s offerings as nothing fancy simply good food that nourishes and rejuvenates the body n nit seems like cutting something in half so we could easily share it particularly after the plate has been delivered to the table for us to appreciate it s beauty and after we ve communicated to our server and demonstrated with the first two courses that we were splitting the items is in the vein of nothing fancy n nhow about providing the customer with an appropriate utensil to cut it themselves then n nthe fact that the chef was obstinate in refusing to cut the kfc side sized ear of corn provided with our entree screams pretentious and grandiose and tainted our entire experience n nto quote my dinning companion you are not james beard and james beard would ve cut the corn the bar is full of amazing rum selections that speak to you when you walk in the drink menu is simple and they have some delicious options i ordered the jerk chicken and enjoyed every bite i will visit again not a fan we sat outside and there were flies everywhere i don t know why they wouldn t have citronella or something the food is crazy overpriced but it is tasty i can t rationalize the we spent on scallops overall as good as the food was we won t be dining here again jamaican me crazy was recommended by a client and glad i gave it a try if you are looking for a cozy intimate dinner and mouth watering rum cocktails this is the spot to be i went here for my birthday about couple weeks ago and there service is excellent the food was great i highly recommend the chilean sea bass and the jerk chicken i will definitely be coming for more this a wonderful place with some of the best food in phoenix the rum drinks are incredibly innovative the staff are very friendly and knowledgable the atmosphere is cozy and warm this is a great evening spot in downtown phx the rear patio has a lot of character and is a perfect spot to unwind and enjoy some rum the cuisine authentic and delicious my colleagues from jamaica thought it was super legit as well the food is delicious and authentic they use real scotch bonnet pepper here so it has a very good flavor not every thing is spicy but spice can be added to anything just ask they are nice be warned caribbean red peppers is very hot taste is like a sweet phenomenal jalapeno but about hotter spice n nupdate i have ernt back a few times since and noticed that some of the service is kinda pushy not to me directly but its easy to notice i can t really review the rum bar without reviewing breadfruit they are really one in the same and breadfruit s food stole the day but to be honest we have never physically be in to breadfruit we only go to the rum bar and we love this place i have been there times once when i was a sardine and packed into the place without room to even breathe once with my parents in the comfy window seating are and once with my husband on a romantic date for i loved it every time and by the third time i was told by my husband you have to yelp this place now and he then exclaimed i think this is my favorite food in the entire city n nmy husband is not one to stake claim on anything less than spectacular he is married to me so here i am giving them the highest rating and review i can muster n nthe drinks are extremely tasty unique clever and strong i love the rums and the free tastings we have had of the various types of rum this place has really opened my mind and expanded my knowledge i like that the bartenders and staff always ask our names and take an interest in what we are eating drinking talking about and liking about life they are so kind n nbut and yes there s a but the rum bar experience won t be bringing us back it s the food that is the big draw what a great culinary experience every bite is a wonderful adventure the spices the mixture of fruits with the savory dishes the fish oh the fish n nwe plan on going back again and again the location is a little tricky to find but if you found sens turf it s in the same block nearly the same building but just around the corner don t despair just walk south and take a left east and you ll see breadfruit on the left excellent waitress service very friendly and knowledgeable n nfood is excellent very healthy clean nothing fried all farmers market ingredients cool spot of downtown phoenix mango lemonade is very good nice spices decided on the breadfruit and rum bar for my husband s birthday as his family is from a caribbean island the service was absolutely outstanding staff were very polite and made excellent recommendations cocktails were inventive and quite tasty food was delicious and my only complaint was not having more johnny cakes with the jerk shrimp husband was offered a choice of rum or dessert on the house for his birthday which was nice and unexpected the restaurant is a little pricey but everything was so delicious it was worth the extra cost highly recommend i walked here on my lunch and decided to try the jerk chicken salad the server was friendly quiet kind and not pushy i ordered my salad and a ginger beer to go i was impressed with their drink selection n nthere were only a few other people in the small restaurant when i sat down to wait minutes for my food the ginger beer was good it had a nice strong bite to it when i got back to the office to enjoy my salad i was a little surprised n nthe flavor of the salad was really good and the ingredients were fresh however the spice on the chicken made it very very spicy i would say it was a little too much for my taste and i enjoy spicy food i just don t like my food so hot that my eyes start to water and i can t stop sniffling from my nose running n nnow maybe it s not always that hot and that was a one time thing hard to say i m thinking i should go back and give it or something else on the menu another try everything looked way to good to give up on this place after only one spicy chicken incident had the pleasure of visiting the breadfruit on saturday night usually don t go out of my way to write a review unless i was really blown away by a place was able to make reservations the night before which was nice i really find it astonishing that this place has only stars for the place it is i have to agree the place is a bit small but not to the point where you feel crammed to start out the ambiance of the place is so relaxed and at the same time formal dim lighting a fresh aroma and jamaican reggae tunes in the background we were seated right away to our table and were served by carly which i gotta say really made the night she knew the food and drinks menu like if she was the chef and bartender herself for the drinks i had the spanish gentleman and the shorty which i gotta say have probably been some of the best cocktails i ve ever had started with the small plate scallops and then the woodfired jerk chicken the combination of herbs and spices really come together for an incredible experience of flavor in your mouth to my surprise i found out that the host himself dwayne is the actual owner of the restaurant when you see the owner as involved in his business that way you know the standards will be high ended up running a pretty big tab and have never felt better about paying for such a nice dinner please don t give your star review as joan p did below just because the jamaican caribbean restaurant did not have your vegan options come on go eat your grass somewhere else smdh thank you dwayne and carly i will sure be seeing you again very soon i really enjoyed my visit to this restaurant an upscale carribean dive that has great location food and drinks what more could you ask for i had the jerk chicken and the vegetable medley the jerk chicken was seasoned and cooked to perfection with the right amount of heat the rum punch was great and the servers were kind my only complaint would be the pricing compared to the portion size not sure if this could be the best option price wise when looking to satisfy your jerk craving but its will be an option you wouldnt regret the best jamaican food i ve had i m jamaican and i live in california and this is the best jamaican food i ve had the prawns were to die for and the fish was wonderful the servers were very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu def will be back back to arizona just to eat here lol this is the stylish lounge adjacent to the cozy jamaican restaurant known as the breadfruit i loved the vibe of this place as soon as i walked in the door their list of rums is quite impressive so if you are a connoisseur then you simply must go here they have a menu of fun signature cocktails that were mostly tropical themed it sort of reminded me of hula s modern tiki bar in that respect but in this case the rums really are the main focus and any fruit juice or other mixers are meant to enhance and highlight the flavor of the rum itself the first one i tried was the spicy rumtini which was really delicious though i expected more heat my husband wanted a jack and diet coke but was told that they had neither no whiskey since rums are their thing and they also don t offer soda with artificial sweeteners however the bartender recommended he try the tennessee rum cider this drink tasted surprisingly like whiskey but actually is made with a rum called prichard s fine which is made in tennessee mixed with an organic apple cider the second drink that i tried was a dark and stormy i had this drink at citizen public house and didn t really care for it but i really enjoyed this one now don t get me wrong i am well aware that cph mixes up the best cocktails on the planet but i just happened to like this particular drink here at the rum bar better one of my companions said it was because of the type of rum they use goslings n nthe cocktails were all or and their wines were a glass but they had dos cabezas yay so because of that this would never be someplace i would come drink on a regular basis though i certainly don t mind splurging on a premium cocktail every once in a while i saw they also had a cigar patio so i think this would be the perfect place for a classy bachelor party or b day fantastic drinks and cuisine that goes above and beyond whatever resort food you ve had in jamaica n nmy jerk pork was fantastic sweet and savory with just the right amount of heat and i really enjoyed the brussels sprouts that accompanied the dish and i hate brussels sprouts seriously i ve tried them at some of the fanciest restaurants ever and i ve always despised them i have no idea what dwayne s chefs do to make them not only edible but fantastic n nmy wife had the red snapper which she found a little disconcerting as it was served whole however the preparation and spicing were perfect and any initial trepidation was quickly removed with the first bite it was served with some sweet ish bread and a pickled dipping sauce outstanding n nwe sat at the bar where we were expertly taken care of by a busy bartender neither of us are huge rum aficionados but he found the perfect cocktail or three that no only fit our palates but exquisitely paired with our dishes n nbreadfruit is a small and intimate setting if you re in a hurry it s probably not for you if you re looking for an extensive menu or have food issues or non adventurous tastebuds it s probably not for you and if you re trying to re create that one time you went to jamaica a decade ago head back to sandals n nbut you can bet that we ll be back there are still plenty of experiences to be had this tiny place on an off the beat street downtown surprised me i heard it described as a hole in the wall nothing could be further it s delightfully clean and crisp interior is tastefully decorated very hip the food is fresh fresh fresh and delicious n nfried plaintains yum tofu in a curry sauce yowza oh and this delightful iced um tea it was more like a clove tea perhaps very spicy had to alternate between sips of that and water but overall a very friendly inviting place service was lovely and attentive and everything was great the portions were large so i had leftovers for lunch the next day too nnote that there is an inexpensive corkage fee on beer or wine so bring your own oh and free corkages on tuesdays it s a shame to go to a place that has great food and drinks that is spoiled by servers that have the personality of a donkey this place just has a pretentious feel about it if you re looking for a place that makes you feel welcomed and appreciated don t go here great good and drinks along with snobby service cheers dear breadfruit may we suggest one small business decision when your customers tell you they can t eat the food because it s so incredibly over spiced and beg for something to cut the heat do not may i repeat do not charge them for a tablespoon of chutney that comes in a tiny dish n and while we re at it when a customer can t eat the over acidy and untasty messy coleslaw and can t eat the main dish and has devoured the one eight piece of corn that passes a vegetable do not may i repeat do not charge for a second tiny piece of corn n so sorry we won t be back this is my favorite restaurant in the world everything is not only on point but excels at everything it tries n n ambiance gorgeous quiet lighting dark and intimate you can choose between sitting on the small patio or inside a balance between quiet experience yet still fun and lively n the drinks beats the blues was a colossal success balancing the earthiness of beat juice spiciness of cinnamon and other spices and of course the rum all the drinks are rum based and fabulous actually including the punch of the day n the food caribbean so lots of jerk and seafood yet there are also vegetarian options n the service absolutely incredible every waitress waiter i ve had have always been so accommodating n ni look forward to the next time i get to go to phoenix and eat here again great rum selection and rum cocktails the food was also wonderful but the portions were just a little bit too small very fun place to forget being in phoenix and enjoy fun flavors i found this place to be warm friendly and with very good food i enjoyed the avocado spring rolls rice peas and the roasted corn on the cobb to top it all off i had two cups of delicious carrot juice the waitress was attentive and personable my all time favorite place in phoenix make sure you sit at the bar the bartenders are extremely knowledgable regarding rum and the drinks they offer they are super friendly just know that if you order the sometime in august you will be drinking bacon from a glass i didn t care for it but all the other drinks we tried were amazing we didn t try the shorty but it ll be first on our list next visit they fill the glass with smoke from burning sage before pouring the drink looks awesome i don t even like rum but the drinks were amazing the food was also amazing finishing the night with hot buttered rum and a cigar on the back patio was perfection made it hot buttered rums n njust go there was not impressed with happy hour the only drink special was a rum punch and half off beer and wine there were only beers other than that all the other cocktails were priced normally aka expensive also the staff was not friendly besides our waiter who was very nice and didn t bother to try and make us feel welcome they also didn t bother to tell us bye or even acknowledge when we left i will say it was nicely decorated and had a romantic ambiance but i will not be coming back for happy hour after a campus tour of asu my parents and i drove around downtown seeking a spot for lunch my mom saw a little sign on the corner that she thought said bread fruit we figured maybe we d grab sandwiches or something nthen we walked up to find it was actually breadfruit jamaican cuisine although it is definitely not what we had in mind we decided to stay we were so glad we did what a delicious delightful surprise nwe sat outside and the extremely accommodating waiter made sure the umbrellas shaded us from the sun i must also note that the restroom was impeccably maintained and super cute as well ni was continuously impressed with the customer service throughout the meal i didn t actually look at the beverage selection and tried to order a diet coke when the waiter explained that everything is made fresh on site so soft drinks are just not possible definitely another unexpected and awesome element of the restaurant i had the mango lemonade with crushed mint it was divine n nwe ordered a variety of appetizers n pan seared scallops the waiter spoke highly of the sea scallops and explained how and where they are shipped from to ensure freshness i didn t even have to ask for this information but it was another example of the service and commitment to quality i cannot speak highly enough of the scallops spicy and perfectly seared with some bell pepper and green onion drizzled with oil n plantain avocado spring rolls yummy with a wonderful mango chutney you expect savory and get a little sweet instead there s only two on the plate so don t expect a huge quantity n fresh baked patty empanadas we got both the spinach and tilapia i would definitely get these again the tilapia had a nice little spice to it n house tropical salad perfect on a hot day cool and refreshing and perfectly paired with any menu item n nsince i ve decided to go to asu i definitely plan to return and byob awesome and i plan to keep that in mind nunfortunately because i will be a super broke student this place may be out of my price range sometimes the average plate is over but for the service quality and commitment to freshness and locality i think it is definitely worth it delicious food agree with all the favorable reviews on here don t quite get the bad ones perhaps the most flavorful meal i ve had in phoenix the brown stew chicken is my favorite for sure very addictive and spiced just right on our second visit we learned its byo take a bottle of wine and they will open it there another plus they have blue mountain coffee shipped in direct from jamaica my friend and i wanted to try something new that would be a change from the normal food on the go meals we eat during the week so we made the trek on into phoenix and surprisingly found the place on the first try yes the signs on the main street helped it is a cozy place read small but it has fun eclectic decorations and i loved the little lights along the window n nthe waitress was very friendly and we were soon set up sipping drinks i loved the ginger beer so spicy and yummy for a drink that looked like hazy water never one to turn down plantains we ordered the avocado and plantain spring rolls the chutney was good and i liked that the rolls weren t insanely greasy but they didn t seem that special to me nothing popped out n nthe brown stew chicken worked well as a comfort food but again there wasn t anything that would make me order it again what fascinated me was my friend s chicken and dumpling it had good flavor and at the bottom of the plate was a large round solid thing of well something i had never seen a dumpling like it and i have to admit to being skeptical but when you got a cut of it used it to wipe up some sauce the dumping was great it was heavy solid food and yummy as well the kind of food i d go out once in a while for and come back with a full tummy wanting nothing more but to lay out on the couch n nwe ordered coffee and shared the sweet potato pudding for dessert the two complemented each other perfectly i love sweet potatoes and this pudding was no exception all in all i liked the dumplings loved the dessert and guzzled the coffee to stay awake for the ride home three stars for killer cocktails and a great wait staff dock two for the appalling hostessing we walk in at announce we re going to have one drink and ask to sit indoors we re told all the tables are reserved we sit outdoors on the totally un temperature controlled cigar patio in june in phoenix we walk back in to leave most of the tables in the bar are still totally unoccupied there are too many other nice places to drink in phoenix to tolerate that level of service disappointed i was really looking forward to eating jamaican food and had been craving it my husband was excited to try jamaican food for the first time n nwhen i asked if i could have white rice instead of rice and peas i was told the chef didn t alter the menu what i ended up ordering was the nastiest thing ever some weird shredded beef the plaintains weren t even cooked all the way and were a bit raw n nmy husband s food was just as bad we were so pissed that we wasted when we could ve gone to a real authentic jamaican restaurant only reason i m giving it a star is because our server was great n nnever again my fiancée and i have visited the rum bar on numerous occasions with various combinations of friends and recommended it to countless others being rum enthusiasts my fiancée herself is caribbean we were thrilled when we initially thought was a hidden gem this place has gone downhill and we must not be the only ones who think so as it was almost empty tonight won t be going back anymore n nthe problem i think boils down to attitude on the part of the staff which i m guessing starts with the ownership for example their tamarind ball ii drink comes with a nice sweet tamarind ball on top as a garnish my fiancée loves these so when we went tonight we asked if we could have a second on the cocktail the waitress said sure and it would be a no problem the bartender across the room starts violently shaking his head no he informs us still across the room that these things take hours to make and that we could not have any extra we were literally the only people in the room an hour before close not to mention you can get a bag of tamarind ball candy essentially for at food city just sloppy customer service the bartender seemed to take great pleasure in saying no n non top of that being regulars we ve seen the cocktail menu change a few times and we have some favorites of old times not only do we know their names but we know their ingredients tonight we tried to order an older drink and were informed that if its not on the menu they won t make it plenty of other bars reward and even admire their regulars for their loyalty and enjoy the nostalgia of older drinks here i m guessing the bartender was just too green judging by how much time the owner spent correcting him n nto finish it off i must mention the owner he gets a lot of credibility around phoenix as a rum guy and i ve always admired him for being an ambassador of the spirit if you ve ever seen him at an event though or had the misfortune of being sat by him at the rum bar you d know he s got quite an air of superiority about him tonight he sat at the bar feet from us and heard us complain again we were the only table a top for over an hour on a thursday night he said not a word to us never asked after the food or the drinks never thanked us for coming in never offered to explain any of the menu or the options he just sat at the bar until a minute to close when he quickly gathered his things and left the place n ni imagine the staff dislikes being here as much as i do so i don t fault them for this i do fault the owner though rum deserves better caribbean food deserves better phoenix deserves better overpriced especially the drinks had a reservation and asked to sit outside but were told no even though the seats outside remained empty the whole time we were dining asked for less ice in my drink yes ten dollars for one drink that was all ice no drink and was told no that the bartenders could not do that because the drinks were measured perfectly food was ok nothing special that i couldn t make at home my first time trying jamaican food and might i say that i was not upset i had the curry tofu and it was the perfect mix of spices absolutely delicious i was blown away with the depth of taste very savory for cocktail i had caipirinhas off the menu and again i was in awe i m not a fan of rum so i was not sure what to expect but the caipirinhas was great for deserter had buttered rum and rum cake again was delicious must check out if visiting phx i stopped in this place after work for a quick bite and a few drinks and am singularly unsatisfied the drinks were overpriced to a preposterous extent we ordered two items off the small plate portion of the menu and they undoubtedly lived up to the name the portion was smaller than the chances of them getting a good review at this point each plate had only enough food to leave a colony of ants hungry a spoon full of peanut butter would have left me more satisfied than the terrible excuse of a plate there the drinks were more watered down than pop music on the radio if you do not value yourself and think you aren t worth having nice things then this is your place food was great we had the jerk chicken pork and polenta and lamb everything was very good except for service bartenders were short and rude and not very welcoming server was very unpleasant and seemed very unhappy and impatient we will not be back least fun bar in phoenix for a rum bar it is super dull skip it or fall asleep while waiting for drinks food is great and caribbean authentic deserts are not the best at all lots of rum which is pretty cool it is very expensive for what it is i wouldnt do it often but its cool once my boyfriend and i went to the rum and cigar bar part of the establishment and isaac was our server he was amazing definitely should get a raise or praise from work he told us all about the history of the establishment how the drinks would taste and how they paired with cigars really made my night to have such an attentive and sweet server excellent food portions were right sized not too big i had the fish which was well spiced with habenero i agree with the other reviews that service is really slow though i m not sure why yuuum it was my last night in phoenix and i wanted to have a nice meal before flying out i ordered the jerk chicken and a few vanilla mojitos it was very well done and quite different than any other meal i ve had i would love to go back and try the rest of their menu i went to the rum bar at breadfruit with my friend to visit her boyfriend and grab some drinks after first fridays and if you want a great nay amazing mojito come to this bar it is the best n nthe prices are pretty moderate for the specialty drinks and food i ordered scallops for the appetizer they were cooked to perfection and my friends wrapped plantains and avocado so good n ni will definitely go back to try there dinner meals n ngood for groups of to not good for anything larger n nrecommendation to anyone wanting to go to a dark bar and a great rum drink the food was really good i liked everything i tried it s a little different that they dont do take out and they are not very accommodating with substitutions and special requests but the food is very satisfying so i will be back we went for lunch and i look forward to going for dinner and the new rumbar i really really like this place the seating area isnt that big but has a friendly feel nthe chutney that is accompanied with most of the meals is great i tried the jamaican beer and was a instant fan fyi this review is based only on the cocktails as i have not yet had the opportunity to eat here i went twice this past weekend i stopped in for one drink on friday night with a friend and went back with my wife and some friends on saturday after dinner to explore more of the cocktail menu we tried several drinks on the menu and every cocktail was clearly well crafted and perfected the bartender i think his name is brian was very knowledgeable and easy going he is a very skilled bartender and you can tell that he really enjoys his craft n nthe only criticism i have relates to the server that i had on the first night a friend ordered a red stripe and the server looked disappointed my friend asked the server if he shouldn t order the beer and the server said that he probably wouldn t order a beer in this bar overall it felt very judgmental what the server didn t realize was that my friend was ordering a red stripe to have something to drink while he continued to look over the cocktail menu later on that night i asked the server about an ingredient in one of the cocktails and he answered confidently i later learned from the bartender that the info provided by the server was incorrect i feel like a server should really know the cocktails inside and out in a bar like this especially if he recommends them over a beer i debated knocking the review down to stars as a result of this but those interactions were rather brief and i feel like my overall experience was overwhelming positive and that people should really try this place at least for the cocktails alone i am of jamaican decent this food taste pretty authentic this jamaican done with an upscale twist definitely worth a try for anyone who likes food with a lot of flavor sat in the new bar and had me some rum nflight and vanilla mojito was mighty yum yum nas it raged down my throat and warmed my tum tum nmade my body go numb pervert hands now rubbing nmy baby s booty bum n nordered the appletin rum sea scallops next ndefinitely the best in the southwest with a spicy kick of zest nthe crispy mango fish rolls which were only so so nstill craving dem scallops give me some mo give me some mo n ncurry chicken with dumplings was my main meal ntexture is dense if you like that type of appeal ncomfort that ll make ya re invent the wigga wigga wheel nand kick off your hood rat heels n nboyfriend ordered the jerk chicken off da grill nfinger licking the last of his meal ndamn can i get a bite or do i have to steal nprices not too bad of a deal nthis rum has got me coping a feel n nleaving room for some dessert nthe blue mountain coffee has got me on full alert nman looking so good got a girl doing the slurp slurp nhe s trying not to get hurt nas he reaches for the sweet nlove n potato pudd n n noverall breadfruit was the bomb nfelt like i was in jamaica passing that bong a client of mine recently came to phoenix and the concierge at the renaissance recommended the breadfruit it was almost embarrassing because the food was awful and we left after beer and two appetizers do not waste your time as the flavors were terrible i meandered over to breadfruit on friday for lunch and though the owner and staff were incredibly nice and hospitable even took time to explain to me the theory behind ital the food just wasn t that good i wanted to like it i really did but my order of curried chicken with dumpling was only edible the curried chicken was delicious but the wheat dumpling that accompanied it barely qualified as food it was a gooey cylindrical mess n ni liked the decor and ambiance of the restaurant but i don t think i d come back here unless it was just for a side order of plantains mmm plantains did you that there are different types of rum i sure didn t but at the rum bar they have over different types of rum have a variety of drinks to order i m sure you can go through the entire thing and never order the same drink twice crazy n ni have been on a coconut kick for a while now just love the flavor and the texture so i went with a pina colada it had matusalem platino rum pineapple kalani coconut liqueur and coconut let me tell you this was very yummy if it wasn t a work night i would have ordered another one or two n nif pina coladas aren t for you they have many other drinks to offer you it s a sweet little bar look forward going back we d heard of breadfruit and decided to stop by before st friday last week the design decor is fresh colorful and simple in a trendy kind of way the waitstaff is incredibly friendly and attentive and the kitchen is exposed so you can see your food being prepared they have traditional caribbean drinks and fresh squeezed carrot juice with coconut and ginger the avocado chicken spring rolls are tasty but could use a little more spice for dinner the chicken dumpling is delicious well the chicken is but the jerk shrimp plate is a bit sparse and overpriced for what you get overall we liked it and we ll be going back again to try some more dishes this time we ll be sure to byob really unique sophisticated atmosphere the restaurant serves spicy jamaican cuisine and lots of rum we ordered an appetizer of calamari but it was not the deep fried version rather it was just grilled squid with a fruity floral sauce the appetizer has won a few awards and we know why squid usually has a rubber like texture but the appetizer we had just melt in our mouths it was definitely pricey for the amount you get but worth the experience of fresh squid at its finest i ordered the pulled pork over polenta i wasn t a fan of how smokey the pork was but the meat itself was very tender there was way too much sauce poured over the polenta which made a weird texture but would have been great with out it my husband ordered a tropical fish dish which was excellent i will definitely try this place again wasn t a fan of my dish but look forward to trying something else on the menu oh how i love delicious rums the wife and i went on an adventure through downtown the other night and stopped off at the rum bar for some late night cocktails the place is small and dimly lit and has a whole wall of rums for tasting n nthe bartender was very attentive and let us know that the rum bar was still in their soft opening and invited us to their grand opening this week jan th i believe while we didn t eat he explained the food menu to us and noted how several items on the menu were very hot which we like very much n nnow on to the rums they have a whole wall of rums for tasting and mixing the most expensive of which was bucks a pour yikes all the ingredients are made fresh on site and all the fruit freshly squeezed each day just a couple of beer options and a couple of wine options but other than that it is only rum we had a few cocktails that were very enjoyable mojitos and hemingways all the way around and plan on returning often n noh and did i mention the super rad reggae and dub tunes that were on the stereo anytime you hear a bob marley song in which bob or anyone else for that matter never even sings a note you know the dj knows his reggae an awesome addition indeed n nif you like your rums this is definitely a place to check out just another super cool bar in the up and coming or entrenched downtown phoenix bar scene update grilled calamari is still on the menu but no longer served i m doing my best to separate rum bar from the breadfruit even tho the service is shared between the two although my original intention was just to have a cocktail and experience the new bar our server was super cool and told us about the specials hearing about food on an empty stomach well i didn t have the willpower to say no n nlooking over the menu i noticed that there was a grilled jerk chicken entree with i think potatoes at around our server described a similar special roasted jerk chicken with wild rice and vegetables so we opted for that one since she did an amazing job at describing it after being so hungry you d think that i d love whatever food i would get my way n nunfortunately the only thing good about my dish was the server s description of it the dish was half of a chicken with every single bone and skin still in there on top of rice there were tiny pieces of vegetables which i couldn t even distinguish to a side the chicken was spiced ok hot but not too much but it was extremely dry and a giant pain to cut up after literally struggling with my dish for mins i became frustrated and annoyed especially since every piece that i successfully managed to cut off the bone wasn t even that pleasing to the taste the rice was just a ok not particular flavor and the dish just seemed like a regretful choice n nto make things worse upon getting my receipt i see that my chicken special is whereas the chicken entre on the menu which is identical is that s it this restaurant is trying too hard to be fancy but not even delivering the quality and taste that a fancy restaurant should have n njust come here for drinks do yourselves a favor and eat elsewhere have been to breadfruit twice now both times for drinks and appetizers both times the greeting was exceptional but do not expect much can do service while employees are nice and professional you will get nowhere asking for example for a virgin drink with no alcohol on both visits we had non drinkers and simply asked if we could get one of their signature drinks made with no booze it is almost a scripted answer no we do not do that certainly can understand this if the ingredients may have mixes that also contain alcohol but come on with such remarkable mixologists jus ask them they will tell you it seems implausible that a non drinker could not be accommodated this was a trend because on our first visit someone in our party asked if they could get a particular run drink made with a touch of ginger i believe that was it and again no we do not do that really since when did a rum bar become as set in their ways as a german deli it is a great place with we are sure great food we have just tried some bites and desserts but the ownership definitely needs to relax a bit because you can almost see the waiters wanting to accommodate you but they apparently cannot this is review is not about the food the food was great small portions n nthis review is about the server who sat our party we had a birthday party last night and we had two extra people join us she was very rude about have those two extra people you would of thought we were not wanted does she know people yelp n nshe finally sat us outside all split up this was a tuesday night at no one was even in that tiny restaurant the service was ok they kept telling us there was a charge for everything extra i m sorry but when you are paying per cocktail and for a piece of salmon i think bread should be free right olive garden n nour bill came to and i left still hungry n nthis is also a rum only bar who even likes rum that much i stopped by the other night and i have to say it was fun the curries were interesting and the stews were great it took a bit long for the food to get to our table but we had a great server and the owner was such a nice guy that i really hope they do well because they come across as real genuine good people that care about what they do i think the place is cute clean and well put together try the meat patties and it s cool because it byob so be sure to bring your red stripe impeccable service authentic food i was sooooo looking forward to a real mojito but sadly there s a serious lime shortage next time there will be a next time i ll stop by sprouts bring my own limes now let me start by saying that this place has the best rum collection i ve ever seen i had one of the best mojitos i ve ever had i also had a rum flight that was bucks pretty sweet now on to the service n nlook i get that it s busy and there s a lot going on i get it scout s honor i ve heard bad things about the service here but didn t believe it could be that bad boy was i wrong we sit at the bar and after minutes or so we re able to order our drinks not sooo bad but a little slow we start to notice several tables approach the bar to either get their check or pay their check apparently they had been waiting quite some time i get halfway done with my drink and start thinking about getting a nd drink and a tilapia patty the bartenders were busy working away making drinks not bothering to check on us at all i don t want to be that jerk at the bar that s waving them down so i patiently wait and just try to make eye contact with them and wait and wait and wait and wait you get it right about minutes goes by and a top in the corner had to approach the bar to get menus and i had just decided to not get anything else finally about minutes or so go by and we re able to get our check and escape again i understand being busy but c mon get your ish together yo n ni will go back hopefully this was just an off night for them the food looks great location s great decor s great and they have an epic rum collection i sure hope my next experience is better its been a couple years since i last set foot here and quite a bit has changed went to rumbar recently but hadn t had a chance to check out the breadfruit and its updated menu until tonight the original place is still largely in tact but has a distinctly refined look to it now it used to be just a hole in the wall type of place but it now feels like a really well rehearsed performance the food has largely stayed the same with alot of the usual jerk and caribbean favorites on this night i went for the pimento wood smoked mussels good stuff though i wish i could ve had more the beans and rice were solid the bread was delicious just as i remember and the drinks from the rumbar were on point we topped off the evening with a chocolate creme brûlée my girlfriend was a happy camper with that one overall the breadfruit has definitely matured from its early beginnings it still has the feel of a neighborhood haunt but feels more like a sit down restaurant than a humble startup the prices are a little on the high side with some of the dishes and some of the cocktails are a little steep but overall i m very impressed with how breadfruit has evolved must get hot buttered rum and a tasting flight n nsix months ago i began my love affair with rum i found out i would be working on the rums portfolio at diageo initially i thought i d prefer to work on tequila or whisk e y categories i felt were more exciting i am happy to say i was completely wrong the rum category still has a perception problem it is so much more than fruity tropical drinks and rum coke these drinks have a time and place but there is an entire world out there experiencing traditional brown spirits cocktails with aged rum is divine the old fashioned or manhattan as well as replacing gin in a negroni as one example n ni m home for the holidays and wanted to check out the breadfruit rum bar in phoenix arizona there aren t many bars dedicated to rum dedicated means there are no other spirits aside from rum yes they have red stripe and guinness beer yay diageo and select arizona wines but that is it they have a rum manifest that separates their rums into multiple categories premium aged think zacapa or bacardi silver cane amber pyrat xo black goslings overproof goslings and cachaca ypioca they also have cigar rum pairings loved to see zacapa paired with arturo fuente as a cool feature you can even bring your own cigar to enjoy finally there are rum tasting flights naturally i had to get the one with zacapa xo the most expensive flight the grand reserves taping is with english harbour year old appleton estate years old and zacapa xo solera grand reserve n nas my cocktail i got the hot buttered rum made with gosling s black seal house coconut liqueur butter cinnamon nutmeg and rum whip three types of rum dark rum coconut rum and rum whipped cream i mean come on dessert cocktails are always a favorite of mine so delicious n nthe bartenders are the true stars of this rum bar when i visited bryan and danielle were behind the bar they were patient and answered my many questions about the back bar ingredients and whatever else i wanted to know about we sat at the bar when we visited this is always my preference i love engaging in conversation with such masters of their craft n ni look forward to coming back here on my next visit home and sticking around for dinner the jamaican influenced menu looks delicious whether you re a rum lover rum novice or just a lover of bars you must check out the rum bar at the breadfruit i really enjoy the food and cocktail there cocktails as long as you like rum order anything from the menu and you are in for a treat for the food i just love the jerk pork and polenta it has a lovely kick to it the right amount of food i always feel nicely satisfied never heavy it is just a unique taste for phoenix so it makes me happy nnow with that said the experience of going there takes some getting used to first no matter what always make a reservation they are not busy all the time but they always ask you to take a seat and wait even if you have reservation but at least with reservation they don t tell you it is going to be mn even though the restaurant is half empty so there you ve been warned make a reservation take a seat it will be worth it the breadfruit has always been one of my favorites i m always welcomed by name with hearty smiles being a single woman party of one often this is the best place in town to feel comfortable and never alone n nalways a fan of the bar menu the new release of latest and greatest spring cocktails are stellar the french marmalade has been haunting my dreams for the last nights after last evening though the smoked mussels will be doing battle with that cocktail for my dreams ire mon truly ire i did not have a good experience at the rum bar you d think with a name look that they d be a little more laid back there were at most other couples inside dining and we wanted to dine outside another couple joined us but we had to sit at the bar until they arrived which is ridiculous once arrive we sat outside and ordered we then had another group of arrive who casually joined us on the patio to order a drink the waiter s approach was abrupt and was very offensive to our friends he could have easily set up another top and invited them to sit but he made them feel like they were in the way so they left we then paid our drink tab and left too we tried to speak with the owner but he was on the phone rum bar should rethink their image and quick being so uppity and become a true rum bar the drinks were only so so the waiter was pretty rude and was trying to tell us what to order when we didn t order what he recommended he seemed annoyed we ordered the seared scallops for an appetizer and they were not seared rather mushy the worst part of the meal was the portion of my meal i ordered the special red snapper wrapped in a leaf of some sort i saw the couple at the table next to me eating it and their portions looked appropriate when i got my meal i had maybe ounces of fish a large piece of raw pineapple and some sort of a bread stick i don t know if the waiter was trying to punish us for not ordering enough cocktails but i have never had a portion so small not even in paris made reservations at on a saturday and waited maybe three minutes to be seated the place was busy but wasn t crowded however by every table was pretty much full glad we made our reservations our waitress grace was kind and gave great options for drinks and entrees i had the shim sham drink at the beginning and my husband and i ordered two of the avocado and plantain rolls for appetizers so yum for the entree we both ordered the jerk chicken with rice and veggies and that too was great nthe place is worth a visit although it s small it has a great vibe to it my advice make reservations grab some drinks and sit back and enjoy your company neverybody around us seemed happy we had a great experience so i know we will definitely be back i ll keep this short and sweet n nyes i believe they only carry rum and limited beer red stripe anyone if i m mistaken someone correct me but that s all i seemed to see n nyes you should still go here no matter what your alcoholic preference is n nand dear god yes you should drink a dark and stormy and then one more rum bar interesting i guess this restaurant tries to push varied rum drinks to coincide with different parts of the meal like wine pairings at a fine restaurant however i am not sure that multiple rum drinks necessarily bode well for the drive home n nregardless that is the least of this restaurant s problems service is poor and the food was worse all four of the people in my party received food that was not hot presumably because the waitress let the food sit in the kitchen too long when ready when she was told our food wasn t hot her reply was that she would yell at the chef not improve our circumstance nadditionally my jerk chicken was dry and overdone as well as no longer hot n nbreadfruit and rum bar too cute poorly managed and bad food preparation no thanks i was looking dinner and came across this restaurant as it was not far from my hotel as i walked in it s pretty small inside the bar is well stacked and had a nice menu to choose from something for everyone s palette i sat inside as it was a little too hot outside the waitress offered her suggestions as she figured out this was my first time dining at the establishment i felt the atmosphere was very classy to start i had a punch bowl in which they change that drink daily it was amazing the plantains as the appetizer and the red fish as my entree those two dishes were great in taste a twist on the caribbean favors very fresh it was just not enough food i do not eat a lot and i was still hungry after the meal i did order dessert the something sweet potato that was very good and a nice portion i take off one star with the fact that they barely give you enough food for the price my gf gives it a but i think it is closer to a so this post is a the menu is a bit limiting i have eaten a fair amount of caribbean food and i while i thought this place was good for phoenix i was not all that impressed most of the food was tasty but the vegetable sides that came with the meals were just cabbage and simple peppers wtf no flavor and the dumplings looked like something i wouldn t want anywhere near my food it nearly spoiled my appetite and maybe they shouldn t stress how much everything is localy grown and organic it s a jamaican restaurant in phoenix how local could it be well that point was answered when our waiter had to clarify the locality of a few items one more thing what is up with the bottle opening fee i was going to bring a bottle until i read that n ni am sure to eat here again if the menu changes seasonally and they introduce some new items throughout the year i will probably revise my review to be a little more favorable if nothing changes i will take the rating to a i have been to the breadfruit rum bar a couple of times now the first time was several weeks ago and i didn t have any expectations i was pleasantly surprised to find that the food was outstanding the staff was friendly and accommodating and the atmosphere was warm and inviting fast forward a few weeks to visit number two unlike the first visit my expectations were very high based on my previous experience i was delighted when those expectations were not just met but were exceeded thus far everything i have tried on the menu has been excellent the salmon is off the chart delicious and highly recommended also do yourself a solid and save room for the sweet potato pie for desert this has quickly become my favorite restaurant in phoenix can t wait for my next visit the drinks are unique and tasty the environment is warm and inviting the food is very good it is a great place for a date spectacular everything was good bartender was an expert in his craft even enjoyed a nice cigar out on the patio despite the july heat will come here again every time i m in town i ve only been once but i m looking forward to going back the bartenders are engaging and fun the drinks are fantastic but the food was just okay granted i have limited options due to dietary health restrictions but i think i ll probably eat elsewhere before going for drinks of course i ll give them another try first but for the price point i was expecting something more exciting n nin addition to fun staff the atmosphere is wonderful definitely feels like an upscale tiki bar i also think it s fantastic that they re participating in ethical sourcing of their fish i don t eat fish for the record but if i did i d be glad to know where it came from and that s information they can provide yummy joint great fun fun atmosphere cool vibe nothing to over the top but great place for drinks and or dinner apps island fusion fare as in caribbean nice decor very romantic and intimate patio seating out front and a cigar bar out back if you smoke cigars and we don t nhad no idea it was reservations strongly suggested but they accommodated us at the bar nall rum based cocktails and the one i had was super tasty they have quite the mixologists on hand i had a fish dish it was good small portion for the price nbeen wanting to try this place for some time glad i did but a little pricey for what we were expecting this place was amazing food was so full of flavor and very fresh and local we were expecting caribbean food but not this good jerk chicken was so good who knew rice could be so flavorful pepper shrimp so spicy wonderlish we will definitely be back reservations needed as very full even in summer stars for rum bar for breadfruit bar was out of ginger beer which eliminated the best cocktails on the menu those that i tried instead were just ok but interesting cocktail menu with decent happy hour options at i agree with the prior reviews on breadfruit quality food authentic menu good service but higher prices than what you d expect good tunes on the playlist and a good first date place awesome concept with consistent quality but i just wish there was a bit more too it n ntheir drinks are very good but your choices are limited to either straight rum or whatever few drinks they have decided that they are going to make on that particular day i find it incredibly odd that a rum bar won t serve a mai tai everyday of the week n nthe food is very good flavorful but the choices are limited the menu doesnt change much so i dont have an inclination to return and eat the same thing again n nservice is good pricing is fair decor is nice classy and the restaurant is small so you better make a reservation i am defnitley a fan and i ve eaten there twice in the last few years most recently this past weekend no complaints at all about the taste of the food price bang for the buck ratio not so much n nwe had the fish rolls today s catch spinach with a sauce i would have thought was jerk waitress said it wasn t and pickled mango n nwe also ordered plantains and the jerk chicken dish everything was fresh and tasy portions are much smaller than i would have expected the plantains i think were five pieces totally minimal seasoning and was expecting it to be more crispy n nfish roll dipping sauce paste was so good i asked for some more to have with my chicken waitress said no i was a little pissed they say they make everything fresh and in small batches and she brought be out some mixture of onions peppercorns and habanero in vinegar wtf n ngrilled jerk chicken was great small breast piece fresh seasoning similar to paste but more spicy grilled pineapple jicama and a corn n the cob ndessert with the local ice cream and sweet potatoe cake thing was also tasty ni just glanced at aileen b s review she ordered same stuff and said the same thing maybe owners will read these consider some changes chicken breast can be had for bucks a pound so a larger piece wouldnt kill them and the bananna cookin it a little more would make sense maybe add some kind of rub or spice desert was great as well we ordered mojito and i think the hurricane also tasy felt like scottsdale prices but under dollars for decent drinks i wasnt impressed with the mojito like azcentral was that rated it best in phx next time maybe spend more time in rum bar next door and eat elsewhere to fill me up upon the recommendation of another downtown restauranteur my wife and i checked out breadfruit and the attached rum bar what a terrific suggestion thanks cibo nwe were staying at the clarendon hotel and so we light railed it downtown super easy and got there early to hang out in the bar for a while dwayne met us at the door and got us settled at the bar kristin was our bartender for the evening good thing too since i had no idea there were so many rums and rum drinks and so little time we placed ourselves in her capable hands and she paired drinks with our food all night long we started a scallop appetizer perfectly prepared and i had the tradewinds swizzle my wife had the hemingway daiquiri which turned out to be her favorite drink of the night after some time at the bar we moved to the dining room for a fantastic supper i started with soup of the day then on to the jerk chicken fantastic kristen was true to her word and provided some really tasty drinks to go along with our equally tasty meal nwe ll definitely return for more of their delicious fare heard great things from several people so we decided to give it a go after the scallops app my mouth is on fire i like spicy food when it s not so hot it burns or lingers several waters and minutes later still on fire not pleasant hard to enjoy the food when it burns the rest tasted good not overly impressed small portions lots of flavor peppery jerk spicey loud and hot inside summer and had a fly buzzing around we couldn t seem to get rid of i can see why folks like it but it s a bit limited and spicey for my taste i won t be coming back too many other great places in phx to try and go back to n ni was refraining from alcohol from the evening so can t comment on the drinks so my rating is strictly on the food love the ambiance n nthe small plate and entree selections we ate were very good delicious sea bass with a lovely presentation ceviche plantain spring rolls loved the rum punch with ginger the back patio is relaxing and lends itself to small group discussions unfortunately our waiter was a little awkward he tended to come ask how wee were doing when we were clearly in a deep discussion when he did so he tended to try to make small talk and attempt humor by the time he understood we didn t need anything and walked away we were hard pressed to pick up our conversation where we left off n ni still recommend this restaurant amazing food and ambiance our server christian walked us through the menu and helped us order yet perfect drinks and meals she was a wonderful guide everything we ordered was outstanding great cocktails but the atmosphere is very condescending and unpleasant i brought a group of about people for a happy hour and as people trickled in we were repeatedly asked if we had a larger group coming when the full party had arrived we were asked to sit in the back patio i e smoking section which was not a nice thing to do to my non smoking friends where there was no seating for groups larger than i want to be clear none of us had had anything to drink before our arrival we were not belligerent we were not rude we were just treated that way n nwe were also given conflicting messages about substituting different varieties of rum in the cocktails and were charged absurdly for the privilege of doing so until we were told it was impossible because we would single handedly ruin the owner s entire brand n nall in all it s a good place to go for a cocktail they re tasty but it was easier and more pleasant to do business elsewhere i haven t gone back and i have no intention of doing so i m giving this place stars for two reasons n n i am reviewing the rum bar and not the restaurant else the rating would go down n i am writing this review after my last experience with a less than stellar bartender n nso let s start with the bad first i think rum bar s popularity is outgrowing their space which isn t a bad thing we just didn t have enough room to chill the other night no big deal n nmore importantly i ve seen three bartenders at rum bar i believe beth and dwayne were the first to bartenders i ve dealt with and to say they are amazing and know their stuff is an understatement they know their rum all or so varieties they know their cigars and damn it they know how to make a good drink unfortunately their work is overshadowed by the new guy whose name i never learned his drinks weren t bad but his abruptness cockiness and attitude sucked all the magic out of the place n nok enough of the bad now to the good the atmosphere although small is great a nice dimly lit cozy bar area is a good place to cool off or warm up depending on the season but if its summer or otherwise nice out hit up some of the many adirondack chairs and benches outside if it s a little warm the misters will overtake the patio in a good way n nbut seriously the rum is responsible for half the namesake of this downtown gem get some any of their specialty cocktails listed on the menu are expertly created never too sweet never too strong you will taste the alcohol and the complete essence of the drink not sure what you want snag one of those two awesome bartenders who double as servers within the bar and patio and tell them what s on your mind branch out try something new n nsee you at the rum bar three of us ate here last night and i ll definitely go back the service was great emily was fantastic and so helpful even when i called to get directions and the owner daryl stopped by our table after the meal to make sure everything was alright what a nice guy ni guess if i had a critique to make it would be that the appetizers should be larger they re very inexpensive so in retrospect we should have ordered two or three of the avacado spring rolls and empanadas but i would have preferred them to be priced as two or three instead of one nother than that the food was great i ordered the curried tofu excellent choice and cleaned the plate martha ordered the jerk chicken hot hot hot and binnie ordered the chicken and dumplings which was unique and really tasty nall three of us said that we d definitely go back again the short and skinny is to come here for drinks and dine elsewhere the drinks are expensive but they are all unique and pretty well executed my karrots was a mix of carrot juice pimento and ginger with rum i liked the overall flavor and the boozy level but i felt that it needed more spice and definitely more ginger since i didn t taste it at all n nmy friend s kiwi drink was very sweet but very well executed and perfect if you just want sweet drink not something i could order repetitively n nfinally my friend s piña colada was like a dessert super creamy and indulgent but enough to slowly get you drunk without you noticing n nthe one big big fault on their part is that they don t make caipirinhas what you have a giant bar solely dedicated to rum you carry different types of cachaca brazilian rum but you don t make caipirinhas that s as silly as silly gets folks i mentioned it to the server and she told me that they may put it back on the menu i hope they do what can i say went here for lunch i really liked the place and god knows it fills a very vacant niche in the phoenix restaurant market but i l know nothing good every comes after but i really like you but n nhmmm i ordered the jerk chicken i was very excited i love jerk chicken but it was dry i have only been there once so take my review with a grain of salt however jerk chicken has got to be the signature carribean entree so they gotta execute will i go back absolutely i really did like the place will i oder the jerk chicken again probably not the rum punch is ridiculously amazing at a glass during happy hour it just keeps you wanting more and more and more reserved a table for a birthday n ngot to the venue they had no idea who we were neither a table ready n nfood was ok rum was great n nnote they do not split bills and charge you per plate if you bring a birthday they almost refused allowing us to eat the cake in the restaurant incase it contaminated their food the scallops and rum old fashioned are pretty bomb n nhowever the service is a joke drinks take at least minutes and scott s is rude he has an attitude when you order and when i handed him my drink with broken glass he was upset that i didn t want to keep it n nnot a repeat place the food was ok although the price point was a little high i was one of a group of nine we were having a great time until the bill the server springs on us that he can only accept two credit cards that was very inconvenient especially since he didn t tell us until we were paying like i said we were people and were pretty much the only people there during their lunch hour i was surprised they were not more accomodating although we all enjoyed our food for the most part we all decided we would not return i love breadfruit the last time i went in i was bummed to see they weren t carrying my favorite bok choy dish any longer maybe it was seasonal but the food was fantastic as was the vegan dessert if i lived closer i would go here at least weekly cute atmosphere great music and wonderful food went here for my birthday dinner with my family the star of the meal was definitely the drinks the rum punch was perfection thank god i had the delicious hot buttered rum for dessert as the sweet potato pie was not my favorite service was stellar the meal was slow paced which was nice for a relaxing night with the fam would probably return for more rum i highly recommend this place the food is phenomenal and the drinks are absolutely amazing the bartenders ryan and eric are artist behind the bar and extremely knowledgeable about every aspect of their menu its definitely a paradise for every rum or seafood lover nthank you for the wonderful service i will be back again i went to bf a while back thought the food was just ok the way my friend i were treated when we showed up a few minutes before our reservation was a true slap in the face they were completely rude told us to wait in the hallway near the bathrooms until our table was ready what was interesting is that there were only a few patrons in the restaurant i m a huge foodie and recommend many establishments to my clients and this one is definately off the list i don t care how good your food is but if the service is bad i will never return there are too many great restraunts in the phoenix area with great service and great food to waste my hard earned money at a place like bread fruit when we arrived to this mostly empty restaurant there was a party of and a party of that were told to wait for their tables we were told to wait as well even though as you look around the restaurant and front patio were empty we were told we could not sit on the empty front patio since it is reserved for dining guests only that is fine but again after we left we still saw a bunch of empty tables on the front patio we saw the person party finally get seated on the empty table after about minutes same deal with us as we were escorted on the tiny completely empty back patio lounge chairs our waiter was very good and was a relief to see good service after dealing with the pretentious host when we asked about ordering appetizers now we were told we were not allowed to eat on the back patio even though it was completely empty besides us too many rules not customer friendly almost feels like they are trying too hard to give the feel of an actual busy highly sought after restaurant owners should reconsider the incompetent host and all of his silly games they called to confirm which was good as i then had the phone handy as the show we were at ran longer after starting later than we anticipated they graciously accommodated us party of great specialty cocktails and the food did not disappoint as usual i had the molasses lollipops which were pretty delicious and are actually chicken and a fabulous punch however the waitstaff was kind of icy although the bartender was very friendly and everything was overpriced i d go back if someone asked me to but it s not somewhere i ll choose to frequent i went to the rumbar for the first time yesterday and i was not disappointed the bar staff was the epitome of mixology i could have spent a few hours watching them expertly craft drinks alone they have one drink the shorty that requires lighting a sage leaf on fire then covering it with a glass to add smoke flavor to it pure genius whomever came up with these recipes i applaud you the food was delicious with lots of flavor i highly recommend the daily catch and the fish spring rolls the cocktails are a must if you visit the mixologist can recommend libations based on palate there s an authentic jamaican restaurant in phoenix yes you can re read what i wrote there is an authentic jamaican restaurant in phoenix we had the jamaican jerk chicken and it was soooo spicy which was exactly what we wanted the place is small but it s quaint that way i love when they have music and i heard the rum bar is amazing i haven t been since that opened but i will now that i read the other reviews a rum drink and a spicy jamaican jerk chicken sounds divine in phoenix no less make reservations for weekends we met some friends here last night for dinner and drinks despite not having reservations as this was a last minute occasion the manager owner squeezed us in and i thoroughly appreciate it he definitely made us feel like valued guests n nour server christian was absolutely lovely she kept our drinks filled and put up with our juvenile antics all night long give this girl a raise n nthe cocktails were delicious the pina colada was stunning it is not your margarita machine jimmy buffet esque frozen beverage it s a real deal colada with coconut cream coconut rum and a whole lot of yummy i also tried the rum punch they make a new one every day so it s always changing it was outstanding and i think it s probably good that it comes in small classes i m pretty sure it s dangerous n nthe food was honestly underwhelming my jerk shrimp was spiced well and i believe they were good quality prawns but they were overcooked and chewy my husband s jerk pork suffered the same fate of being dry he did enjoy the polenta that came with it n ni wouldn t pause for a second to come back here for drinks but i would probably dine elsewhere the breadfruit has delicious and had a wonderful atmosphere i had the scallops which gordon ramsey says they are difficult to make but you would never think that when you come here they were slightly spicy yet provided a delicate flavor the jerk chicken salad was a little hot for my taste and lacked a little salt with that being said i loved the fresh fruit in the salad i am a vodka drinker but was eager to try their rum drinks i am sure glad that i did our bartender was extremely knowledgable about the restaurant their culture and picked what is now my favorite cocktail the shim sham i absolutely recommend this place just bring your wallet as the drinks are and the food is greater than know what spices your palate can handle super small very intimate worth at least one visit also home of the tiniest bathroom sink ever n nwe went here for a friends birthday a few weekends ago a reservation is highly recommended since they are so tiny our waitress recommended we try rum bars house made punch yum n nnow ive never had jamaican food before but im now officially a fan as a table we shared the best mussels ive had since diving for them ourselves in new england as a kid for the main course i had the jerk prawns holy spicy batman so good my husband is notoriously picky about his food but he rather enjoyed the molasses fried lollipops he got overall everyone was very pleased w their food choices n nour waitress was very attentive and knowledgeable and the atmosphere was very unassuming and chill n nif youre in the mood for something a little different i recommend going here i was so disappointed in my experience at this restaurant now reading some of the reviews i guess it is normal for this place so i also will not be back i came on a tuesday evening by myself i also was asked to sit and wait i guess they do that to everyone they wanted me to sit at the bar and i guess i should have in hindsight or just left but i was interested in the food anyway they sat me at a table that was practically in the kitchen the restaurant was mostly empty i think there were other tables occupied the server didn t care that i was uncomfortable servers kept swishing by very close to me which was awful as was the noise from the banging in the kitchen i mentioned it times and the third time he said no worries as i sat there eating and being treated like a second class citizen at the time i thought it was because i was alone i got more and more upset because none of the other tables ever filled up so i guess maybe it s one of their rules that if you re alone you sit at the worst table in the place the other thing is they push you to have these mixed rum drinks with your dinner which i didn t want i was told they have two wines both az wines ok i chose the white which was ok until it warmed up a little then it was pretty bad i had the scallop appetizer which was the only good part of the night my jerk chicken was in a sweet sauce that wasn t good all in all it was not just a bad experience it was insulting and i would not recommend you spend your time or money here years downtown and breadfruit rum bar is still my favorite restaurant downtown the closest experience i can get to being back in nyc always fresh ingredients and locally sourced veggies n nthe mood and environment can t be found anywhere else in phoenix the scallops are still my favorite appetizer while the seasonal drink and entree menu keep the experience new n nbut favorites are the pork belly red stripe shrimp and street style chicken are always consistent the yellow tail catch of the day was phenomenal n nrelax enjoy freshly made drinks with edible condiments perhaps have a cigar in the courtyard even with misters in degree heat at night n nit s a tried and true downtown phoenix experience i loved it great food definitely the service was as good as it gets i loved their drinks and the atmosphere is laid back and cosy definitely returning but will make a reservation this time around very tasty appealingly decorated and tiny the jerk chicken was not overly spiced but had a nice little unexpected kick to it the cocunut curried tofu was excellent great food great service bring your own wine and people that love food and you ll have great time must try the carrot juice trust me n nonly metered street parking and the meters are hour bring change and be prepared to run out and feed the meter on the upside you can see the street from any table so you can keep an eye out for the meter reader came for cigars drinks on the back patio service was top notch and by god were the mixed drinks tasty not your traditional mixed drinks either was very impressed with what i ordered shim sham would come back for a nightcap again n nside note the host was a little odd noticed that mentioned in a few reviews he had us sit and wait to be taken back to an empty patio oh well minor inconvenience the rum drinks are creative and delicious even my prego friend who got a fruit juice concoction was impressed with the tastiness of her beverage nthumbs up cute place that is tucked into a side street quaint on the inside and staff was very informative red snapper was good but the plantains were the highlight walking distance to symphony hall and other spots i really wanted to like the place more than i did n nfirst off i reserved a table tuesday for a thursday night just in case when we arrived they didn t have my name anywhere not that it mattered apparently because after waiting minutes we were escorted to the dining area which had many open tables so then why the delay n nthe wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable recommending several drinks appetizers and entrees and didn t do the usual upsell of recommending the most expensive thing so kuddos there the plantains were excellent the cocktails a bit pricey for a small glass would probably have ordered more if they were closer to the range it s a psychological thing to be sure n nbut anyway i decided to go for broke and order the curried lamb the most costly entree on the menu i love lamb and don t get it often so i usually order it if i see it on a menu but i was very disappointed when it arrived it tasted wonderful don t get me wrong but the portion so tiny literally chops bites per chop i ve had much larger just as succulent and delicious at a much better price at other restaurants when i looked at the amount of food others including my date were receiving for almost dollars less it was tough not to be annoyed i spent most dollars and left hungry n ncannot say i would return anytime soon as many times as ive been to the breadfruit im surprise i haven t written a review for it yet this is my favorite restaurant to go to you can find me and my girlfriend there at least once a month as we both enjoy the place very much i enjoy the look of the place alot its not big and fancy hell you could easily pass right by it and not even notice its there but that all adds to the charm of the breadfruit and makes it seem like its a secret place that only you and whoever you are dining with knows about its also a romantic place for a date the paintings on the wall are for sale it can get a bit loud when it gets filled only because the place is small but that s a minor gripe when my girlfriend and i go she gets the brown stew chicken i get either the curry chicken and dumplings or the jerk chicken and i don t even like spicy food that much but the jerk chicken is so good i love it quote me on what im about to say the breadfruit has some of the best and strongest drinks i love their drinks there because they are never watered down the first sip of your drink may seem pretty overwhelming but don t worry its just the alcohol telling your tastebuds to wake the hell up the drinks are smooth and very tasty and you just taste a hint of alcohol in the drink even though they put alot in them which ive always thought was good when the alcohol doesn t overpower the taste of the drink the dark stormy regular or the dark stormy are my drink of choice highly recommend either one of those one more thing whatever you order make sure you get a side of festival bread i don t care if your meal already comes with it order a side anyway its very delicious bread a dinner for a couple averages between if u just get dinner and a couple drinks but if you just get dinner and no drinks then its between wow i initially thought this place would be a super casual run of the mill caribbean inspired diner type restaurant but i was way wrong after being greeted by an elegant gentleman i immediately noticed the cool red stripe pendant lights hanging over the bar ripe with a fine selection of rums and other libation offerings after finding this place on opentable for a new years eve dinner again i wasn t anticipating or even necessarily wanting a five star experience but i m pleased to say that s what we had however the only reason this isn t a star review is because i was a bit taken aback by the fact that their pre fixe menu wasn t advertised properly before i made the reservation so we spent a great deal more than we anticipated to on one meal despite that my beau and i enjoyed one of each from the options and also opted in for the cocktail pairings sure enough everything was absolutely amazing and my favorite dishes will probably the soup and the swordfish i look forward to visiting this place on an average night and i m grateful for the great service and delicious dishes the restaurant is a bit cramped but they make good use of the space the host seemed very busy and not very engaging with the customers almost robot like the presentation of the food was good but the flavor was just ok i ve had lots of jerk chicken in my years and i like the more authentic spicy jerk chicken the jerk chicken here is more like the american style jerk chicken which is basically bbq chicken with a kick overall it wasn t bad but it definitely could be better the owner was great he let us sit at the bar asking patrons to move to make room for the four of us without a reservation once we sat the bartender helped us to choose drinks and food hands down some of the best jamaican food i have eaten the owner even suggested a great pairing for my escavitch fish the daiquiri agricole was strong and an excellent pair to the spicy fish n nthis place was so good we recommended it to other friends who went later that night but because it was late they had already run out of some of their menu items so i might suggest getting an earlier reservation so you get a chance to try the plantains and the fresh food go early this place is small and fills fast i had a chance to check this place out before going out and about on first friday in february and i was quite disappointed the concept of the bar is awesome and the drinks sounded great but the overall execution was terrible really this rating is completely based on service and maybe i should give it stars as their drinks are very good but that s about it n nupon arriving at breadfruit rum bar we were told to sit anywhere in the bar area and someone would be around to serve us there were about or so people in the whole place restaurant and bar so it didn t seem that busy however it took about minutes before someone came over to take our drink order or even acknowledge our group not a good sign n nafter we made our order or estate mai tai dark and stormy mojito ponganot and french caribbean breeze two of which were the server bar keepers suggestions we waited and checked out the decor the ambiance inside is dark and relaxed but made reading the menu almost impossible others around us and our group were using cell phones to try and read the menu it was so dark i get trying to give a place a vibe but can we get a little bit of light to read n ndrinks arrive these were amazing i had very high expectations given the selection of rum and narrative behind everything we ordered but was still impressed drinks were well blended and decently strong the mai tai was off the charts and might have kicked my ass had i gotten another n nwhich brings us to the next drink that never happened our server bar keep came by mid way through our cocktails and asked if we wanted a second order but given the time it was taking us to get through the first one three of us waited and one ordered a red stripe n n minutes pass and most of us are either done or close enough to order another but no server drinks done and our group is waiting for another minutes no red stripe and no second order what the hell now we are sitting around waiting just to see how long it takes but after more minutes we give up and go to the bar to get our tab more minutes go by and we finally have our bill but there is no breakdown of what we ordered it s just part of good service to always bring a breakdown of the bill and we were curious to see if the red stripe we ordered and never got was on there sure enough after more minutes of waiting to get a breakdown of the bill there was the unicorn red stripe getting that off the bill was another minutes and finally we were allowed to leave n ni m not sure what happened that evening but there is no reason for poor service the place was not that busy and they were clearly not understaffed based on the amount of staff roaming around the staff seemed preoccupied with assisting those sitting directly at the bar instead of the lounge seating behind the bar stools and the bar appeared to be getting great service i ll give it another try for the drinks and sit at the bar but it s with hesitation and low expectations of service amazing food lick your plate amazing truly this is a definite date night restaurant located in the heart of downtown phoenix by the asu campus this quaint caribbean inspired restaurant has a rum bar and a fresh daily new rum cocktail to enjoy everything is delicious i ve been here about times and have never been disappointed reservations strongly recommended considering this place has such good reviews on yelp i thought i d love it but i really didn t i typically love jamaican ingredients and dishes but the food just wasn t that great and we tried an appetizer scallops and dishes the tofu and special of the night which was snapper so disappointing n nthe drinks were really spectacular however carrot and some other fruit which i forgot rum bar great vibe a touch higher class for those not familiar with rum rum connoisseurs step up and bring your a game n nowner duane is knowledgable and approachable to discuss rum history science and experience bartender brian is accommodating and the music is on a cool vibe no dancehall here all old school hits n nsalt fish fritters are good but small and rice peas are good no experience with dinner menu but heard food was good from patrons we spoke to n noverall cool spot awesome atmosphere inside and sitting on the patio the food is so tasty i d recommend the shrimp dishes the fruit punch bowl which is made fresh daily service is great and i will be back portions are small so if you eat larger amounts or are overly hungry you ll want to order several appetizers the scallops were delicious mojitos perfection our service was excellent and we were quite pleased with our experience my only gripe is that they try to squeeze too many people in a very small space and they should let people know they have a dress code this is arizona and your in the middle of downtown phoenix with a large college population however i like the idea of getting dressed for dinner personally but to be told that one of my dinner guests couldnt sit in the dining area cause he was wearing a tank top a little off putting since we had been sitting there waiting for a table and had made reservations that info coulda been given excellent jerk prawns the seasoning was perfect and while they were spicy they weren t so spicy i couldn t enjoy the meal the sides the prawns were served with were good as well coleslaw grilled corn breadstick the beverages they offer here are wonderful as well while i was initially wary of getting carrot juice the carrot juice they offer here is slightly sweet from the addition of raw sugar creamy and the nutmeg they added gave it a very nice flavor the pink ting grapefruit soda is also quite tasty as well as the refreshing apple cider locally produced n nduring our meal the waiters strongly suggested that we order the beans and rice with the jerk entrees i tasted some of the rice and beans from my husband s entree brown stew chicken which tasted ok nothing special if it is so strongly suggested to add the beans and rice to the entree why isn t it included automatically in the entree then n nminus some points for naming your restaurant breadfruit but not having breadfruit on the menu it s like calling your restaurant kentucky fried chicken but not offering any chicken p i didn t know what to expect but had a great experience here very thoughtful menu and cocktail program both of which were thankfully well outside of the typical new american phoenix menus where of the menu is the same everywhere good service and ambiance i have been to the breadfruit a couple times i ve always enjoyed it i was sadly a little turned off this last time because of our server we ate on the rum bar side he was the bartender and i have just never dealt with a more pushy waiter he basically forced my friend to order their drink special and then would not stop talking about the scallops i seriously thought he was just going to order them for us it really took me aback don t push so hard dude n nwe split the plantain and avocado spring rolls awesome we both decided on the jerk shrimp salad which was also really great i ve had their chicken fish and those damn scallops and they were all good all drinks are based with rum so if you like rum uh duh n ni think my favorite thing there is their french press coffee served with a little coconut milk you barely need it their fresh carrot juice is delicious too believe me n ni guess overall a nice place to grab drinks or dinner if you re in downtown phoenix just please breadfruit lay off if i don t want something i don t want it don t try to talk to me about it for more minutes to convince me i think keeping your customers is more important than one up sell i came in with a group of friends for dinner today margaret was our server the food was great i wasn t very impressed with the plantains i m used to them being a little more cooked i ate the curried coconut tofu which as pretty good the drinks are a must do the mojitos were excellent along with the black cherry mango punch i m not a fan of either fruit but i did like the punch i can t feel my tongue n ni didn t know that jerk chicken translated to spice with a little chicken on the side i admit that i have sensitive taste buds when it comes to spicy food but this stuff was way off my spicy food odometer i would say it was flavorful but my tastebuds were so numb after the chicken i couldn t tell n nhowever i did enjoy everything else the bread that comes with your meal is a festival on the menu but it s darn good and perhaps the thing to save you should the jerk chicken be too much i ordered the shrimps on the side of my jerk chicken but i think i just got trigger happy one dish and and appetizer is already plenty so if the waitress suggests a side of shrimp i say pass n ndefinitely get the plaintain avocado spring rolls interesting texture and taste plus the mango salsa on the side is quite refreshing speaking of refreshing i highly recommend the sorrel to drink it s a hibiscus tea and rum blend but you can t even taste the rum mmm perfect way to beat the phoenix heat n ncute little restaurant with brightly colored walls which is a welcome change from the red brown and tan buildings outside i came here while i was on a business trip and it s walking distance from all the downtown hotels i wish i had room for dessert but i was stuffed i m sad not to offer this place a star review because i sure wanted to going for drinks hit up the rum bar same place and you won t be disappointed not that you d be disappointed by the food you just won t feel the same wow factor you get from the drinks n neverything they make is good you simply can t deny that n nvalue not so much sure most plates are in the range but they are small if just enough the wait staff is friendly but almost in the used car salesman way upsell yep at every course i usually walk out between before drinks never disappointed but i wouldn t go there for food unless someone specifically wanted to yummy jamaican food and specialty rum drinkscute spot for date night not a very big place and we did make reservations through open table but i think we would have been ok if we didn t definitely recommend reservations for a larger group though food drinks are not moderately priced staff was very friendly first off my review is for the rum bar we didn t make it to the restaurant our first impression was not great and i hope i can update my review soon the bar only sells rum cocktails not a rum drinker but i had read that the bartenders are awesome and can pair their cocktails to your liking bartender zero was rude shamed us for suggesting that he recommend one of their cocktails that would compare to a manhattan he was borderline obnoxious fortunately nick saved the day explained the menu and helped me pick out a cocktail one of my friends tried their punch of the day but the other half of our party was so put off by the initial bartender they refused to order so our stay was cut short in the end i really liked my cocktail but getting there was a little dramatic i thought the scene was cool so i will definitely go again after i make sure bartender zero is not working if you love rum go here huge selection of high end rums and all craft cocktails on menu are rum based very knowledgable bar staff can walk you through selections ninteresting menu i haven t had dinner here in a few years so dont think it is fair for me to rate however we had the smoked trout app and that was light and declious nunique bar and restaurant in the heart of downtown worth a stop in i definitely want to sit on the cute back patio when it cools down review update n nchanged to stars i ve visited this place more often and have had nothing but good experience the owner seems to be always present and has greeted us personally every time we come in they have good food good drinks and good service what else can i say the breadfruit is an intimate little restaurant that s perfect for a date we like the atmosphere but have mix feeling about the food we started with the scallops for you only get two scallops it was delicious so we were excited about the entrees unfortunately they didn t live to our expectation the jerked chicken in the salad and the escovitch fish grouper were bland the escovitch fish was not worth the portion was small price was high and the fish needed salt we left still feeling hungry six years later we went back and assumed it improved the service and drinks were still good but no improvement on the food we ordered the escovitch bass fish while waiting we noticed a brothy dish was taken away hmmm did we make a mistake coming here the fish came out it looked good but was small and salty the cherry vinegar and sweet bread stick were suppose to offset the saltiness but we don t like mixing the fish should be good on own just a fyi eating a small whole fish is messy because you have to deal with bones came here while at a conference downtown because it came up on the results for vegetarian in phoenix it didn t disappoint both the soy chunk curry and the pop cho were very tasty as were the avocado and plantain spring rolls we got i d expected them to be raw cold but they were good fried and hot n nalso the my favorite carrot juice is delicious i may try to replicate it at home in the event i ever get a juicer the sorrel was good too felt so bad walked into this place with a huge group right when they were doing last call but what did they do the staff made it happen the waitress treated us wonderfully and immedietly told us the specials i m not a huge rum person at all but the signature drink she offered me was delicious the astmosphere was great very cute spot n n rum bar is definitely worth checking out i m all about new hot spots in downtown phoenix i ve had this establishment bookmarked on yelp for some time now and finally had the chance to check it out this weekend i had high hopes that this place would be amazing or at the very least full of authentic caribbean flavors while the experience wasn t horrible it wasn t exactly good either n nthe restaurant itself is fairly small and can get quite loud due to poor acoustics not ideal for a romantic date date although i thought it did have potential the service was fantastic and some of the cocktails that we ordered were decent the rum old fashioned in particular was delicious most of the other cocktails we tried were too sweet syrupy for my liking n nthe food wasn t bad but wasn t great for apps we ordered the scallops which were probably the highlight of the entire meal the jerk shrimp and johnny cakes were a bit bland we both ordered the pork and polenta as mains since they were out of the brown stew beef brisket which was my first choice the pork tasted like regular bbq pulled pork and not the best version of it that i ve ever had it had a nice smokey flavor but if i wanted bbq i would have just gone to bbq for dessert they only had one option the sweet potato pudding pie it was absolutely awful i have never met a dessert that i did not like and usually i enjoy sweet potato and always love coconut so i was shocked that we didn t even eat half of it the only saving grace on the dessert was the ice cream but you can t exactly mess up on scooping ice cream n nmaybe their other dishes are more memorable but i don t think we will return to find out i would possibly return for the cocktails if i were in the area the price was quite steep as well and i don t think the experience warranted it i love spicy food and i was excited to try this place it was just ok very plain tiny portions sauce flavor the jerk chicken was very dry also they were out of pina colada it took the waiter min to actually come and tell me so i chose another drink and wait another min to bring it he actually just kept forgetting about us the drinks were amazing sooo i would go back for the rum bar i m kinda surprised i am writing this i know i wrote this review before but it says write a review so i m going on memory the food was great we sat outside table of it was a beautiful day i ordered the plantain spring rolls and the main dish escapes me but it was fantastic i was super happy with my food i raved about it to friends which leaves me perplexed why i am sitting here now months later writing this review lol desert is amazing so is the coffee i m not even sure why i have not been back since my last visit i need to get my shit together it would have been a except for the snotty i m too good for the likes of you bartender crack a smile once in a while don t act as if you just don t have time for customers gaby the server was great tho as was duane the owner who came and chatted i lived in jamaica in the past so was a nice catch up food was lovely too jerk scallops prawns johnny cake and lamb were all very tasty very nice setting outside table even got a few drops of rain great ambience and experience overall great location was able to park there and walk am able bodied to symphony after dinner ambiance is unique and intimate very cozy and welcoming the place is humming with good vibes the food was fantastic as were the signature rum cocktails highly recommend a great dinner out i m pescatarian and this was not a problem at this local i wish i could come here for the cocktails weekly they have a mixed punch that changes daily the bartenders are dressed old school in a black vest with a white shirt the bar has fresh herbs and homemade tinctures for their drinks my boyfriend and i went here and had two drinks each the bartender was very helpful in helping us decide which ones to try however i heard their drink menu has changed recently if i am in the arts district again then i will def go to this place the only downfall is that everything is so yummy that your bills adds up before you know it x o lent no i don t mean the cognac first off food was great i don t know what real jamaican food taste like or look like but i gather it s similar to what i ate or hope it is this is a small place so if you want to try it out go during the weekday like i did it s a byob restaurant so like your best friends nfl gathering bring what you want to drink though unlike your friends gathering they ll charge you for what you bring but the price is not bad really our server tonight was on top of it i give this place thumbs up this place is an absolute gem in downtown phoenix it s slightly hidden off st but well worth a visit n nthe selection of rums is fantastic definitely try some of the flights you will not be disappointed the food is delicious and the atmosphere is good that said the portions are ridiculously small and overpriced the wait time for seating drinks food etc is also longer than most restaurants recently went back words repeated brown stew chicken n nwe also had the seared scallops with blackened vegetables they were also amazing i live super close to this place always have but i certainly don t come here enough my fiancee and i came here on first friday a few weeks back so things were a little crazy luckily we had brought our own beer so we were able to crack one open while sitting in the grass waiting for a table eventually we were seated out front so we had an excellent spot for people watching n nwe started out with the plantain avocado spring rolls they were golden crispy and delicious the chutney really made them without they would have been pretty bland n nfor dinner i got the curried tofu and my gentleman friend ordered the brown chicken stew this was not his first choice but they were out of the other two entrees he had in mind we also went through a confusing few rounds of we re out of this nope we have it no actually with our server on my tofu luckily everything that came out of the kitchen was fabulous the tofu had a great consistency nice and chewy and the coconut rice and beans were rich and filling the brown chicken stew was also good says my man n noverall great atmosphere great food a little hit or miss with menu options it was a busy night i ll definitely be back wow i really hated this place n nour server was also the bartender i ate there last night she was either terribly slow or terribly overworked either way not my problem she came to the table and gave us a canned speech about what she really likes on the menu of course wow everything she liked numbered amongst most expensive on the menu big surprise n n if you read other reviews on yelp you can read about the pushy service just awful n nshe talked at us and not to us when we were done ordering she in constant sales mode pushed the rice peas which is jamaican rice and beans n ni love rice peas so even though i didn t like our pushy server i ordered anyway when the food arrived my companion and i each took a bite of the rice and if i would have had a napkin i would have spit it out n nthe flavor could only be described as odd and it was served room temperature we both agreed independently of one another that the rice was inedible n ngosh the way our server upsold us you would think it would be at least edible n ni ordered the soup of the day i was told it was red snapper with vegetable it was a fish broth with vegetables there was no red snapper so why was red snapper included in the title of the soup i have no idea n nso they basically boiled some fish heads put some veggies in and made profit on a soup i was pissed n nof course i would have liked to tell our useless server bartender about this but she never stopped by to ask us how our meal was not once n nwhen the food was dropped we ordered another round of drinks and did not get them until our meal was almost finished n nthe manager came and cleared our plates so i told him he just smiled and basically told me it was my fault for not enjoying the overpriced rice and soup n nplaintains were oven roasted and tasty very stingy portion though i would say about half a plaintain per order these people have their food cost in control baby don t serve any food that s the key n nthe only thing that was good was my companion s jerk chicken it was excellent actually as far as drinks go the overpriced mojito vanilla was also good n nso here s the deal if you are a hipster foodie who likes the idea of eating overpriced jamaican food even though you and your knit cap has never even been to jamaica with stingy portions and poor service this is your place n nthey missed on every level horrible stopped by the other day for a quick togo drink i ordered the my favorite carrot juice which had been hyped on my first visit at first the drink was nice and carro wait a minute did a baby just vomit in my mouth seriously the food i had here was great and every other drink is good but every sip of the carrot juice felt tasted like my body was rejecting a stomach transplant n njust don t get the carrot juice i don t know how they can drink that stuff i am basing this review on two visits n n superbowl weekend we went there it was a hour wait for an indoor table we agreed to just sit outside and lo and behold we ended up with a little table indoors no wait the service was absolutely fantastic my partner is a serious water drinker and his glass was always full the food came out promptly the servers were kind but not pushy or rushed the food was outstanding the drinks were amazing it is by far the best place i have eaten at in phoenix especially for the price n n second time was a quiet weekday i sent two friends to the bar since i would arrive later the two really enjoyed their drinks then we had dinner the food once again was outstanding the service this time was not so great when i arrived she never came over to offer me a drink i had to finally go get her then we had to hunt her down again to get menus she then left us for minutes before being flagged again to take our order later brought our food but didn t provide silverware she was completely inattentive she never offered additional beverages and then we had to ask twice for the bill and again for her to run our cards the bar only has seats how could she stand there the entire night and be so unobservant of customer needs n ni still give it stars overall the food and drinks are amazing when they are busy the table staff are excellent just watch out for the one lousy bartender the breadfruit is such a cute little restaurant in a very nice neighborhood in downtown it s small but very well put together our waitress was absolutely incredible she knew how to sell so kudos to her i m a server anyways she was very knowledgeable and was able to answer all our questions the food was amazing and so were the drinks it was a little pricey so it ll probably be a once in a while thing for me when i m actually in the area or want to bring friends visiting too great experience overall they have a cute little rum bar too well after a year and a few months of living a stones throw from breadfruit i finally made it in there to be honest with you i was not very impressed and left with a bad taste in my mouth i love supporting the local restaurants in my downtown but i don t think i will be returning n nthe girlfriend and i decided to come for dinner and we were both really excited to try the food we were seated promptly and greeted by our server craig i think he was great with describing the food and how spicy and offered his recommendations we had the pumpkin soup to start with some of the festival bread the soup was tasty but was luke warm we both expected hot maybe even a gazpacho like soup but luke warm it had a nice kick that snuck up on you but the temperature really changed it the bread was really tasty though and we moved on to the entrees she had the chicken and dumpling dish the sauce had a curry taste to it and was very good the dumplings while thick and hearty were good as well i opted for the jerk prawns now when i see prawns on the menu i am expecting maybe very large shrimp especially for when i got my plate i was underwhelmed to say the least i saw medium shrimp on a skewer i will say they did taste good but for the price i felt a little bent over the dish was accompanied by a cabbage slaw and a slice of grilled pineapple overall tasty but over priced n nwhat really got me was the bill granted we each had a drink and i knew how much mine was it was before gratuity looking at the receipt i saw the festival bread which sounded like it came with the soup was two sticks of bread needless to say i was just overcome with a sense of disappointment after hearing such great things changing from one to three stars bcoz of great food and they accommodated us later when we revisited them after an hour but the reservation process is still horrible and they acknowledged it hope they will fix it it s sad that they have great food and drinks but the service is not great i soooo wanted to love this place we used to have this great jamaican place around the corner in chicago and were really looking forward to those flavors they were very attentive when we arrived and i thought this will be swell n nthen we met our server this place is not very big and our server who didn t seem to know what he was talking about how s the fish it s yummy how s the short ribs so good not helpful was loud he seemed really overworked which i cannot understand because there are only like tables in the whole place and there were others working n nstarter we had the prawns and roti they were amazingly good one criticism when they say prawn they just mean bigger than average shrimp i understand this is common in certain areas of the us and the rest of the world but the starter was slightly different than we expected nonetheless it tasted amazing n nwe had the rum punch of the day to drink very tasty i would go back just to have the prawns and rum punch n ndinner i ordered the short rib stew their take on a beef stew essentially it was very tasty really i could ve eaten more no really i wish they had given me more the portion was smaller than i expected for the price the flavor was nice and spicy and amazing but i still hadn t tasted anything that reminded me of the jamaican food i had back in chicago i know that doesn t necessarily mean anything but n ntodd had the mussels these should really be on the starter menu i m not sure how someone can make a meal out of mussels there s no side and two small pieces of bread again for the price it seemed strange also while the mussels were tasty and wonderful they were larger than normal and neither of us cares for the larger mussels n nwe were not thrilled and for a birthday celebration it was underwhelming but we had a nice time because the company was good i m just not sure our experience was worth the money we spent so i ve been back a few times since the first time i went and felt it was only right to update my review since the last one wasn t terrible but it did outline some issues in service that lowered my rating since then it realllly seems like they ve made large strides in the service area a group of us went on first friday last week with the mardi gras festivities the same night they were slammed and totally able to balance it all dramatic improvement guys it s one of my new favorite spots to check out in downtown i was a little hesitant to visit this establishment after reading the many reviews on yelp after deciding to take a chance on the breadfruit i am left pleasantly surprised we had made reservations prior to dining and i would recommend that to everyone it is not that big of a restaurant and fills up quickly we started out with plantain avocado baked spring rolls and some jerk prawns both dishes were fantastic the jerk seasoning had an appropriate level of spiciness and the baked plantain rolls were creamy and sweet with the mango chutney that comes with it for dinner we had the pimiento smoked mussels and the jerk chicken both dishes were awesome you could taste the smoky flavor in the broth of the mussels and the jerk chicken was fantatstic n nfor drinks we both started out with their dark n stormy rum ginger beer concoction expensive but worth it also had a couple red stripes which at each is a bargain n nthe waiter was a little pushy with the suggestions and specials but he is partly a salesman and was doing his job n ni will go back to the breadfruit as i am a huge fan of rum and they have a whole other side of the restaurant dedicated to that fine sugar cane juice came to arizona for the super bowl this wknd coming from california breadfruit has been on my list for sometime must say they fullfilled my expectations ambience is fantastic and the food was great savannah our server was awesome as well you can t go wrong with the jerk pork over polenta dish the smoked marlin appetizer was tasty but portion is laughably small you cannot bring a bottle of wine from home here so expect to pay for some fancy drinks they specialize in rum drinks the sweet potato desert was amazing kinda tasted like a cross between banana bread and a macaroon n ni am unaware of any jamaican places in los angeles so this place really stands out as unique loved the jamaican background music when you have great food ambience and service you have found the perfect place stars i would tell anyone in arizona to try this place and cheebos for an awesome night out i really expected to like breadfruit having read the other reviews and being recommended as a veggie resturant really there is one thing on the menu that is veggie i m perplexed and underwhelmed anyway not too impressed with the flavors i thought it would be spicier and it took forever to get a glass of water forever to get our beers opened forever to get our food but i wanted to give stars for a locally owned business that takes buying local serious but maybe give us some more veggie options went to the rum bar this weekend for the first time and absolutely loved it the bartenders take their job seriously after all this is a rum themed bar our bartender explained the different cocktails on the menu which were separated by course with a whole section dedicated to classics like mojitos and daiquiris ni ordered the kingston and the velvet and vinyl the first drink made me feel like i was on a beach somewhere in the carribean the second drink had many layers to it and i could taste distinct flavor of hibiscus in the thick drink both drinks used the finest rum i ve ever tasted i even told my husband man we need to stop buying cheap rum and buy the good stuff that s how much of a difference it made nwe could ve stopped at cocktails but ended up ordering two small plates the scallops and the shrimp both plates tasted absolutely delicious but will say they were definitely on the smaller portion side especially for the price noverall can t wait to come back here for another date night with so many good restaurants in phoenix it s not easy to find a bad one lucky for my wife and i breadfruit was up to the challenge n nsave your time and money there is no jamaican here and no breadfruit beef patties ackee and salt fish brown stew chicken d and g soda or any other staple of the island n nthe price point is completely off the wall and service is pretentious at best and the vibe is hypster with a bob marley soundtrack thrown in for good measure after visiting a couple more times i have seen inconsistencies in how they make their dishes the few selection of dishes is a hindrance if you want to visit the restaurant more than times i am dropping my ratings to stars due to mixed reviews every time i go however their oxtail special is a must the host the night we went was extremely rude basically said he couldn t accommodate our party when there were plenty of tables available therefore we left never to return i tasted breadfruit s sweet potato bread pudding for the first time at this years west of western and then a second third and fourth time until they asked me to stop eating all of their samples so when contemplating restaurants for my birthday dinner breadfruit was at the top of a very short list n nsince i work in wine i think breadfruit s byob policy is fantastic ignore anyone on here who complains about the corkage fee because the markup most restaurants put on a bottle of wine is well over five bucks usually it s times what they paid plus byob allows you to bring exactly what you want to complement your meal i would suggest a dry riesling gewurztraminer or an un oaked chardonnay n nthe menu is small but there were plenty of options even for vegetarians i would have happily eaten everything from the appetizers section but my dining pals and i set our sights on the plaintain avocado spring roll that is baked not fried i thought it was a creamy slice of deliciousness and the accompanying chutney did not disappoint my main dish was the bok choy and mashed sweet potato alright i ve spent about minutes sitting here staring at the screen because i don t know how to describe how great my meal was here s an idea yum oh my gosh it was delicious each ingredient and seasoning was a perfect and direct complement to all the rest it was filling too i mean bok choy and mashed potatoes that sounds like two side dishes to a real meal but this meal is the real deal finally i went ahead and ordered the bread pudding again for dessert it s just dense and lightly sweet and so satisfying mmmm n nbreadfruit s staff were very friendly and attentive and daryl even came over to check on us at the end of the meal the dining room wasn t crowded but we were being very loud per usual and no one seemed to mind in the least what a great experience and delightful setting for a group of friends to celebrate the year s most important date my birthday i went here twice the first time for dinner and the second time for lunch had i only went there for dinner my review might not be so good both times i went there with vegan friends eager to try a new place in the valley n nwe had dinner on a thursday they only have street parking we got there around or and the waitress said we were the first people there all day one other group of people eventually showed up for dinner we had the plantain avocado spring roll with seasonal chutney no complaints here a good appetizer and the chutney was delicious i then had the coco bread pattie sandwich okay this was weird the pattie looks like a combination of an empanada and a hot pocket which they put between two slices of delicious coco bread so i only ate the bread we shared the sweet potato pudding for dessert pretty good no complaints when we were done we waited for min or so for our check i think she forgot about us but she was really nice so we didn t care n nfor lunch we first shared festivals as an appetizer from the reviews i d previously read here i expected them to be so delicious that my tastebuds would jump out of my mouth but that s what you get for having expectations that are too high they were two miniature breadsticks yes their bread is great and only so why not also they were very soft warm i then had the curried chicken and dumpling and my friend had curried tofu my only complaint is that some of the food is too dry like the green bananas and the dumpling the dumpling was this dry solid mass of wheat that i used as a pincushion for my fork or a forkcushion the plantains were delicious as were the chicken and veggies the chicken was not dry despite some reviews i ve read to the contrary n nmy friend finished his plate in a few minutes and told the waitress that it was one of the best meals he s ever had however he was initially concerned with the tofu it tasted so much like meat that he figured it wasn t tofu but was assured it wasn t meat the waitress told us that the guy cooking behind the counter is also the owner and got all of the recipes from his grandmother in jamaica n nwe ended lunch with the grapenut ice cream and jello by the time you re almost done it morphs into strawberry ice cream very good everything was fresh i ll go back if i m in the area a friend of ours was looking online for good authentic jamaican restaurants in az and was referred to the breadfruit grill he took us there for a friend s birthday hoping to try something good and new i don t know if we were expecting a lot out of it due to good reviews what do these people eat but it was no where near my good expectations n nfirst of all we had a reservation and yet they made us wait for about an hour outside in the az summer heat with no water n nsecondly it s byob so we did just that but when we got there they refused to keep our beer and white wine cool while we were waiting it was only when we were finally seated they cooled our wines go figure on top of that they charged us for cooling and corking them n nwe were also told over the phone that we could bring our ice cream cake but since we were waiting for about an hour outside our ice cream cake had already melted almost all the way there was no consideration for putting it in a tray of ice when we got there and asked they finally did when we started eating our entrees when we ate the cake they charged us for plates does this place not get enough customers that they have to charge us for everything n nthe food eh food was nothing to rave about we all got the jerk chicken and about half way eating it we were all dying from it being overwhelmingly spicy mind you of people in our party absolutely love spicy food and have tried authentic jamaican food we even had a few in our party who have even been to jamaica and have tried the food from all sorts of spots even aside from the resort they weren t even prompt with our drinks to help us to subdue the intense spices of the chicken so when i said we were dying our tongues were literally dying i know some of us didn t even want to finish our meal not only did it kill our taste buds right off our tongues it also made us feel like we had dry mouth the chicken was extremely dry and overcooked we all agreed we could make better chicken why bother going to this place if you can cook better chicken at home right n nthe only good thing going for this place was the bread stick that came with the meal and maybe the somewhat quaint atmosphere n nyou know you would also think that with such a big party you d be treated with respect since we brought them a lot of revenue sadly that was not the case it seems like big parties are such a nuisance to them plan on having just a party of people if you plan on dining here with good service but that s even a stretch as i have read on some reviews good luck to you n ni really wanted to give this place a chance because i always love to try new places especially when it is local but that s an enormous but my first time here was just utterly offensive obnoxious disgusting and disappointing it s a shame when a big party all agrees to never step foot in this place ever again n nthanks to this place i have made it a point to look at the low rating reviews and see if they correlate i can t trust the good reviews on anything anymore take reviews with a grain of salt i will let you be the judge of this place and i hope you don t experience our nightmare with this place but this is my take on it n nmy first experience here is definitely the last experience here four thumbs down let me start by saying this used to be an amazing place i have eaten here many many times but stopped going due to having less business downtown n ni went here this weekend and was horrified they changed the menu and the same meal i had a year ago that was stars was now below average it seems as if they lost the cook that made this place so good the food i had tasted like liquid smoke and having been a bbq judge for many years i can tell you that s exactly what it was n ni was very disappointed as i looked so forward to revisiting one of my favorite places in town it is such a shame of what happened this place is full of elitist jerks who think they re better than customers what a shocker tried to walk in with some friends for my wife s birthday would have easily dropped dollars and they didn t seat us because we had too many people at the time there was only customers in the entire place literally two ok guys great service we took our money elsewhere literally never coming back and i suggest you don t either unless you re a masochist who gets off on being treated like shit without question the best drinks in town i never had an affinity for rum until i started visiting this place regularly every drink has so much thought and artistry behind it n nalso their coconut curry tofu is to die for i ve been here more than times and i ve never had a bad experience i ll be in again soon for the fall menu the place has great ambience massive selection of rims and housemate bitters our server was real knowledgeable and fun awesome night my favorite place downtown to relax and grab a drink at the bar lounge or enjoy a cigar on the patio i recommend trying a few of their varieties of rum or a cocktail such as the mojito jamaica or jamaican mule the drinks can be pricey however at this place you finally get what you pay for n ntry the for de cana yr for a rum with the finish and nose you d expect from a cognac i m glad i got to try jamaican food but i won t go back n ni am impressed that the restaurant uses almost all organic stuff and buys as much locally as possible they are located just a block from phx public market after all n ni ordered the carrot juice drink that came highly recommended by the waitress it was just okay i really love trader joes carrot juice and would choose that over this restaurants and it is much cheaper nas an appetizer my friend and i shared the plantain avocado eggrolls i couldn t wait to try them i love avocado and they sounded amazing for the price i think you only get two eggrolls cut in half i thought that was a bit pricey they were a huge disappointment plantains are a bit mushy and bland as a rule and so are avocados so together you got a bland mushy eggroll wrapped in a flavorless wonton wrapping it came with a mango puress dipping sauce which was sweet but not very flavorful and mushy lol n nfor dinner i had the coconut curry tofu the tofu had a texture i have never experienced before and at first i didn t like it but it really grew on me the rice was blah the coconut steamed vegetables was boring from how they sound and the fried plantain was good n nthe restaurant is cute though and the service really good awesome awesome awesome danielle is the all knowing rum goddess best selection of premium rums west of the mississippi had mixed mixed rum drinks with only fresh ingredients made right in front of you atmosphere is laid back and casual did not try the food but came highly recommended by locals can t wait to go back curried tofu gets better every time i go i respect ppl that genuinely care about the food that they put out not very many places in this town live up to that expectation but the breadfruit goes above and beyond the breadfruit focuses on bringing caribbean flavors to phoenix while using locally grown fresh organic produce small kitchen small restaurant one chef it s almost as though they ve invited you into their house for a meal everything is cooked to order which makes all of the difference hence why they don t do takeout staff is always friendly but they are not there to kiss your ass if that s what you want go to a larger corporate restaurant where one small complaint will get your entire meal comp ed and you ll have a manager there with his nose up your arse for the rest of the evening the breadfruit is there to share their food with you and a great experience n curried tofu n scallops n patties talapia n brown stew chicken n have to try my favorite carrot juice it s addicting n oh and of course it s byob well hello yelp long time no see i m back now but in a different city and i ll try to get back in the swing of things so here goes first review in phoenix the breadfruit n n n nthe owner of the breadfruit can tell you where the strawberries they use in their fresh made strawberry lemonade come from and the answer isn t costco n ni went in at kind of an odd time on a saturday after a day of apartment hunting downtown there was a duo and another solo diner both sitting inside the server was friendly and offered great suggestions the weather was perfect so i sat outside at one of the handful of tables on the sidewalk the curried chicken and dumpling were fantastic served with grilled plantains that tastes more like a potato than fruit and fresh bell peppers the dumpling was dense and went great with the curry sauce although the rice and peas that the server suggested were delicious i think the entrée could have stood on its own n nthe server picked up on the fact that i was in no rush and she was friendly and attentive while not rushing me a while later a guy who worked there came outside to eat his meal before the dinner crowd arrived we started talking about the book i was reading food inc and he told me about the restaurant s goals to provide thoughtful local food turns out i was talking to duane the owner and i was pleasantly surprised to hear him tell me the strawberries in my strawberry lemonade come from the farmer s market around the corner and were grown in yuma there aren t nearly enough business owners who care enough to invest the time and energy into such pursuits we talked a little more about our common love for conscious eating and how meals should be experiences not quick fixes to fill you up he explained that this is why his restaurant does not package anything to go i can respect that if you want their food you re going to eat it fresh and you re sure as hell not taking it home to microwave leftovers n na chef businessman with values who eats his own meals talks passionately about being involved in the growth of downtown and can tell you where his food comes from i m a fan n ndid i mention the sweet potato pudd n and vanilla ice cream uh maze ing what am i missing here nthis place has been on my bookmarks for a long time and i finally got a chance to go last night and i left feeling nothing no real wow at the experience n nservice was excellent our gal was great no complaints there n nbetween my husband and my dishes and the two appetizers and desserts nothing really was ahmazing i also didn t hear any comment of wow from our friends from their dishes n nappetizer sea scallop and the ceviche for a party of you should definitely increase the portion this was equivalent to bites per person of the ceviche and the scallops were for people come one snobbery scallops were flavorful but ceviche was ok disappointing n nentrees salmon dish and pork polenta dish my salmon was tasty but not memorable my husband had the same comment about his pork polenta dish nothing to talk about n ncocktails gin co bootleg smitty my husband did not like his gin co drink i tried it myself and it was not tasty my friend s bootleg smitty was delicious though i think really the only thing that stood out the entire night one great cocktail n ndessert they only offer two really neither sounded appealing to me but i wanted some kind of uplifting meal to end the disappointing apps and dinner carrot cake ugh no the only thing i enjoyed on there were the fried carrots everything else was a blur the sweet pot pie no way i didn t find any flavor or anything about it that said dessert i ve never ordered dessert anywhere and not taken several bites it s dessert how do you go wrong n nwriting all this i feel like i literally flushed way too much money down the drain i know downtown dining is more expensive and i m ok with that but to not be wowed or even impressed with your meal is borderline insulting like they re telling you you re paying for the privilege to eat here no thanks came back last week their sauces are more flavorful than i remember them being but they still have a problem with overcooking their chicken and fish i got the impression that the jerk chicken was made a tad spicier than it should have been to mask a lack of flavor though can t confirm this but i have a hunch n nthey seem to have gotten their stuff more together but the food still came across as bland but fresh which is sad fresh food should be tastier n ni d go back again if a friend was paying but otherwise i d pass the carrot juice alone is worth it i crave it n nthis place is so adorable and friendly and the food is tasty i recommend the curried chicken and dumpling in particular and the plantain avocado spring roll the corn is so perfect too n ni want them to serve dark meat but they are going for healthy so they are sticking with the white meat i guess that makes sense but i know the jerk would be so yummy on a wing n ni will be back i want more already interesting spot to hide from the busier bars of downtown and grab an intimate late night drink i ve known about this rum bar for years but because so many places i care about keep closing down i decided a couple of weeks ago that i d stop taking it for granted and dive in n nif you come here at night expect the most clandestine vibes when you take your seat at the bar it will feel as though you should whisper your order you can start with something bright like a rum punch that changes daily you might not know what s in it but you know it will be palatable i needed something stiff i went with the garrison with a nice heavy burnt stick of cinnamon as well as a tobacco tincture it was tough it took a while to finish it put hair on my chest but i can dig it n non your way out you can purchase a cigar to chase your spirits after a long night i quit smoking but i like the idea feels a little noir come to think of it i don t see myself as a regular here but i like it as a cozy little corner for when i want something different no longer byo which is a huge bummer we were very happy taking in our bottles of wine and making a good night of it often with large groups of friends but that is no more the bill of course is now much higher and the wine selection was a bit weak i went here a short time ago with a social networking group i m now a firm believer that downtown phoenix is on the comeback trail i d tried a couple of other joints in the neighborhood including matt s big breakfast and fate so this seemed like the next logical spot its kind of hidden behind condos just one block south of matt s but boy what a find n nwhen you walk in you get that trendy modern industrial feel of a loft you might see in the downtown neighborhood the ambience and music are pretty cool all in all our waitress was extremely friendly and flexible as we tried to split tabs multiple ways she earned a nice tip from us for her efforts i d never had jamaician or what they call east indie food before so i had no preconceived notions about what i was going to eat i had their signature dish the jerk chicken with coleslaw corn and coco bread talk about spicy chicken my mouth was on fire but full of flavor too the side dishes were good but nothing special i had a delicious pineapple soda to wash it down so that helped my burning palate for dessert i had the grapenut icecream topped with cherry jello an unusual dish to be sure but it was definitely tasty n nperhaps what makes this place most popular is the fact that this restaurant is very vegetarian friendly along with a fruit salad medley they have a curried tofu dish and a vegan italian soup about half of the folks i was with had the vegetarian friendly dishes and raved about them i was the only one brave enough to try the ice cream but i promise its nothing scary n nnow this place isn t perfect and here s a couple of reasons why in my opinion no reservations and the place is small so probably want to get there right when they open for lunch or dinner as mentioned above the side dishes were okay but nothing out of this world if you really pressure them they might be able to break out separate checks but as a general rule they typically don t split tabs n nall in all it was a good meal for a reasonable price its great to see establishments like this pop up downtown and hopefully local patrons will continue to keep businesses like this one going we need some ethnic spots like this around town and this one is definitely worth a try and again don t be afraid to try the ice cream james beard would have cut the corn n n okay so i know you must be wondering exactly what that means we went to the restaurant on a wed night picked up a great rose from az stronghold at public market to avoid the corkage fee and was looking forward to a new dining experience n nthings started out fabously the wait person was well informed and helpful with the menu we decided to split three dishes n nwe ordered the scallops appetizer they were perfect done to perfection which is not easily done with scallops we split them put one on each plate n nnext came the jerk chicken salad again a wonderful complement of spicy chicken and mangos the perfect marriage of spice and sweet n nwe commented we had made the perfect choice of the rose from az stronghold and looking forward to the next course n nand so it came jerk prawns grilled pineapple on slaw with a half an ear of corn ahhhhhh there s the rub the plate would looked lovely but because we were sharing i asked the wait person if the corn could be cut in half don t get me wrong i really liked my dining companion but could not just bring myself to nibble on the same ear of corn the wait person took the plate back to the kitchen we were salivating because the prawns smelled really wonderful n nthen the plate came back and the ear of corn was still in tack nduring the course of rest of the evening we were given several reasons why this simple request could not be accomodated n nahh the chef is an artist and cutting the corn would have upset the balance of the design of the plate we could not cut the ear ourselves because there were no sharp knives there are only two chefs and there isn t time to accomodate special requests n nok this is a restaurant with maybe tables by the time we left there were only people left in the restaurant so special requests can t be accomodated also we would have eaten the corn but instead it was wasted n ni am self employed and my customers are everything to my livlihood if i can accomodate i will even though it might not be exactly what i want to do because the more important thing is i want to establish long term relationships with them and have them come back again and again and again n nunfortunately i will not be going back to breadfruit the food was generally good but i would rather spend my dining dollar in someplace the recognizes that it is so easy to accomodate simple requests and the benefit to do that is repeat customers it would have been so easy to have satisfied customers by simply cutting the ear of corn if like me independently owned ethnic reasonably priced and veg friendly is your steeze this is the kind of place you love to love if also like me you prefer to have a few options for inexpensive beer and wine to accompany your worldly cuisine you knock off one star n nwe split the avocado spring rolls to start basically a wrapped up slice of avocado and mango served with a sweet chutney i enjoyed them but i am starting to admit that despite being raised in california and adoring mexican food i will never really like avocados but if you love them like everybody in the world except me you will like this app n nwe then shared the tofu curry and the bok choy stir fry these were both delish and a good value at each n ni was happy enough with my red stripe for but disappointed by the selection of only wines two of which i think cost glass n nall in all very cute place good food and a place you feel happy to support i have been here twice with my girlfriend for various celebrations the first time isaac took care of us he did it so well that on our next visit we had to request him and that is where he really wowed us his extensive knowledge on the food and drinks were amazing he was able to give us extremely detailed descriptions of the flavors of a few dishes and drinks we were torn between in order to help us make a decision from that whole dinner the true standout was a pan seared steelhead salmon with a tamarind reduction the salmon was very juicy and moist but perfectly crispy around the edges i was curious as to how the typically potent tamarind flavor would fit with the salmon i don t know how they did it but the dish was out freaking standing we were also curious to learn more about the whole restaurant concept and isaac was able to tell us a lot about the history of the place and the ethical sustainable sourcing of their ingredients on the second time we were there he was with a trainee who was almost as friendly and knowledgeable while isaac is officially our favorite i have no doubt this place hires only the best of the best in order to provide quality sustainable delicious food with top notch friendliness and service the food was good just too salty i had the jerk pork and polenta too salty i drank cups of water the environment was nice just the service was too slow my girlfriend and i went last night and had a very good time we started with the plantain avocado spring rolls which we both enjoyed n nshe had the curried chicken and dumpling and thought it was good but not great the dumpling was very dense a point that seemed a little odd but the flavor was very good n ni had the jerk chicken off the grill and thought it was fantastic the spice was considerable but delicious the other items on the plate complimented the chicken well n nwe thought the portions were just right and i feel the price of the jerk chicken off the grill dish to be very reasonable considering the quality n nfor drinks she had the rum cider another item she thought was good but not great i had the good jake which i thought was very good and packed a serious punch of ginger i also had a dark and stormy an enjoyable staple drink n nthe dessert menu underwhelmed us mostly because i wasn t in the mood for ice cream so we skipped that course n nthere was one very slight issue with a lack of attention when we sat down after thoroughly examining the menu and choosing our drinks our appetizer and our entrees we had still not even seen a waiter or even received glasses of water i m not an impatient person so i think i was justified in feeling we had been overlooked the first person i did see must ve been the owner i kind of assumed he was not our waiter but i asked him if he was anyway he apologized for our wait took our drink and appetizer order just as our waiter showed up as he relayed the order to the waiter he stated that the first round of drinks was on the house i thought that was a very nice gesture that made up for any mistake on their part based on what i saw of the service at other tables i think this was simply a one off mistake by our waiter and don t expect it would happen on a second visit n nother than that the service was very pleasant and attentive the owner delivered our food and gave us some tips on how to best enjoy the dishes we had ordered water was refilled often i was offered another drink as soon as my current drink was empty all very good service points n nif i could give this place a i would the only mild detractions due to my girlfriend only considering her entree and drink to be good rather than great and the minor attentiveness issue when we were first seated n nwe will definitely be back to the breadfruit nice atmosphere and a cozy little dining room the food was exactly what we were looking for to satisfy our craving for caribbean i thought it was a little on the pricey side but overall it was a great experience amazing had small plates very deceiving taste of the islands on steroids rum drinks interesting and creative will be back i worked at the breadfruit a few years back so i have the insider s scoop after working in many restaurants i can honestly say theirs is the cleanest kitchen i ve seen dwayne and danielle are good people that actually care about the product they serve they buy veggies from the farmers market we once had a field trip to visit and volunteer on a local farm that they buy their chicken and eggs from the food may not be for everyone although i loved it but you should at least stop in for a drink dwayne is a true mixologist his drinks are amazing he s from jamaica and uses a lot of unique ingredients in the cocktails my favorite was their pina colada with fresh pineapple and coconut milk the atmosphere is relaxing with reggae music playing check it out despite the food being pretty good our experience there was terrible we will never be back n ndespite having reservations we waited for more than ten minutes with at least empty tables before being seated fine n nafter finally sitting down my wife asked for her drink on the rocks can t do that said the waiter but he offered to bring a glass of ice cubes with it fine n ni asked for a gin based drink sorry he said although we have a full liquor license all we stock is rum fine n nmy wife ordered the red snapper but since she doesn t like to have her food looking back at her she asked that the head get removed n n it s cooked with the head on said the waiter n nmy wife explained that she knew that but just wanted it removed before it got to the table n n can t do that said the waiter n n why n n the chef considers it insulting n nseriously yup n ni can t make this stuff up you will take it with head attached or don t order it n nchef makes the rules n nand apparently what chef wants comes before what the customers want at breadfruit before coming here i d never really had jamaican food the breadfruit was a really good intro to carribean cuisine and it definitely makes you crave for more i ve tried most of the dishes here and i must say that this place boasts a pretty solid selection of dishes and tastes it s a great place to bring friends to eat and the atmosphere makes for a relaxing environment as jimmy cliff steel pulse or the wailers sound from the kitchen be sure to try out the curry tofu sorrell and carrot juice after dining here last thursday i would classify this as a special occasion place due to the prices and ambiance this was a surprise since i did not get that impression when reading the reviews or maybe it was because the couple of other jamaican places i have been to have been dives i loved the classy intimacy of this restaurant it gave me the feeling that i was having dinner at someone s house who was both a great cook and also had great taste in decor n nthe impression i have of jamaican food is that it has really strong flavors but i found the food here to be a little bland i got the jerk shrimp which didn t look very blackened or like it even had a rub on it however when i tasted it i was surprised and pleased that there was actually a good spicy kick to it this was by far the best part of my meal the sides it came with tasted good but were nothing special i did really love their cocktails but i wrote another review of the bar since that is a separate business listing i like the fact that there was so much seafood on the menu try the mussels they are yummy but i think someone who is more of a meat eater might be disappointed i was also surprised there was no goat on the menu don t jamaican places usually have goat n noverall i think this is a great place for a date night or a quiet dinner with old friends the food just wasn t special enough for me to want to drive into downtown but if i knew someone who wanted to go here i wouldn t say no what a perfect evening delicious thoughtfully sourced and prepared food along with fresh creative and very reasonably priced cocktails wonderful ambiance chef danielle is a local treasure unique menu definitely not what i expected everything had great flavor but be prepared for the spicy food i am not normally into spicy food but i enjoyed it here i had the rum punch and it was a delicious i came here for my birthday and couldn t be more pleased with my choice our group of four made a reservation through open table and were seated right on time our service was amazing our server was super knowledgeable about the drinks and the menu in general he also took a drink off the bill that one of our party didn t finish nthe timing and pace of the meal was leisurely which was perfect for a special occasion meal don t rush your time here nwe had the clams and the plantains as appetizers if you re looking for crispy textured fried plantains you ll be disappointed but the flavors were rich the clams were excellent probably my favorite food item nfor the main course i had the swordfish steak it was perfectly cooked but not spicy like the dishes the other three in my group ordered i almost wish it was a little spicy but the carrot purée and the peanut sauce were a delicious combination nthe highlights of the meal were the drink choices you can t go wrong here nbecause it was my birthday i received a free rum pour of what was probably the best rum i ve ever had i ll definitely be back before next year nsweetly at the end of the meal we received postcards to write that they mail for you i thought it was a lovely touch for a special occasion overall the food was good but the experience as a whole was above and beyond i have been to breadfruit several times and the food is always a quality i was a very disappointed in the restaurants push back when asked to accommodate my friend who is gluten free she made it clear that having bread on her plate would contaminate the entire meal and may make her ill but the server kept resisting stating they cannot take anything off the plate because it ruins presentation i understand that the restaurant does not want allow substitutions but in reality she was asking for an omission when it comes to a food allergy i really would have thought the nrestaurant would be must more accommodating n n nupdate the restaurant owner sent me a message and assured me this policy will be addressed if you are debating visiting the restaurant you will not be disappointed stopped by here once after first friday i liked it but didn t think it was anything to write home about n nthe curry i got and the jerk chicken the bf got were good but the rice was pretty terrible hard and chewy i don t know if jamaican people have their rice differently but i like mine soft and fluffy that s the one thing that sticks out in my mind n nit was a cute date place and i love that they had neat artwork for sale from local artists on the walls reasonably priced too n ndon t go out of your way to check this out but if you re right there and craving some jamaican why not service was not up to par my par is like a bogey lots of rum selection and decent ambiance i was really disappointed in the smoked trout appetizer with all due respect that seemed store bought like the stuff you can get in the whole foods smoked fish section i am not being cute either i have had trout all over the world and almost asked for the chef and his recipe to find out what their prep was anyways i was obviously not happy with the dish and the server seemed to careless about my displeasure menu wasn t deep so couldn t pivot elsewhere n nalso i swear the floors were a little dirty it was dark but i could still tell n ni m not the biggest rum fan although the proximity of this place to where i live could have made it a prime candidate for a restaurant i frequent n nit s whatever a slice of caribbean in arizona i was referred to breadfruit rum bar as i was on lookout for caribbean style food the ambiance and the staff is outstanding let me say i have been twice now and sat at the bar both visits the first evening we heavy relied on the bartenders for recommendations and they did an excellent job helping us out the daily secret rum punch is a must make sure to uber lyft take the bus or walk these sneaky drinks can hit you fast we ordered roasted plantain with mango dip it was quite tasty next up was the jerk chicken it was good not mind blowing but we finished it and felt very happy nsecond visit we picked up our nyc cousin from the airport it was late but he needed a snack after that flight we ordered jerk pork with polenta and we clearly liked the roasted plantain enough to order again i will say i did like the jerk pork better than the chicken the chicken was a little over cooked n nall in all i gave it a because the ambiance sitting at bar is excellent and very educational talking to bartenders sometimes it s just about the company and drinks and yes good food doesn t have to be mind blowing but good food we will be back and maybe sit at a table maybe n nps excellent rum selection absolutely incredible flavors service and environment is wonderful and had no issues whatsoever i am eternally grateful for a restaurant like this there is not nearly enough island flavor in the city and i feel the breadfruit certainly represents it thank you i m going to keep this short and sweet the breadfruit is absolutely delicious one of the best meals i ve ever had anywhere in az hands down we had the appleton rum sea scallops as our appetizer which were the best scallops i ve ever tasted very spicy and very flavorful i had the jerked chicken as my entree and my boyfriend had the jerked pork both were excellent n nloved the space loved the vibe service was great loved the drinks loved the food i can t wait to go back a really cut place with a lot of charm i loved all the different rum drinks they had we loved the appetizers and we had the chix and the scallops and the food is always top notch the waiter was very attentive and helpful in ordering the different drinks i will definetly go back there s a lost generation vibe here the lights are low lit the crowd is sparse but filled with characters and the drinks are above top shelf ernest hemingway wrote his novels here n nbefore the sun rises this is the place to visit if you re over the younger scene you ll probably come to some type of epiphany if you go here alone n nthis place specializes in a variety of different rums i never liked rum before this place cause i got the grocery store i m on a budget version i get why captain jack sparrow is asking why it s gone it s just that good n nso hit this place up if you don t have chest hair you will grow some if you don t grow chest hair you will grow something afterwards so go to find out what i went to college in miami and i know and love caribbean food living in phoenix choices for this cuisine are quite limited so i was really excited to try out this place n npros n love the ambience and that s it s small n the food is delicious n the service is great n the carrot juice is amazing n for the most part it s a healthy take on caribbean food n ncons n the price of the food n nregardless i will definitely return this review is a four for the classic mojitos and a one for the service it is a damn shame because those are the best mojitos i have had in phoenix but the service is so damn shitty don t get me wrong the bartenders are nice but damn do they all need to act like a bunch of potheads i first came here for their grand opening and after things had died down waited at the bar for minutes before waving them down for a drink they kept walking past me looking down the whole time and then would crowd around the computer trying to figure out the tickets very unorganized my friends and i ended up leaving because of how long it would take to get a drink with bartenders i gave it another chance last night and the service was the same it had been a good minutes before the bartender asked if we wanted another mojito my husband was pissed because he wanted to order food and they never checked up on that after giving us a menu as we were sitting at the bar a guy walks up and tells the bartender um we need menus for our top over there in the corner he seemed very irritated the girl hands him menus and walks over to the bartender with the blond dreads and says something about him forgetting about the table i can t say i was surprised at all the same male bartender forgot my first drink when i came to the grand opening my husband and i really want to have dinner in the restaurant but are afraid the inattentive service extends to the servers the menu looks delicious so maybe we ll have to do take out this place is so wonderful for cocktailsssss it s so dangerously good my favorite place to go in phx for tasty beverages but it s expensive so i gotta watchale the owner is lightweight a jerk though i always sit at the bar and drink and never have been inside to eat the drink menu changes w solstice and thy are so yummy this time i got the bourbon masquerade so sarsaparillayyy cherrish and i luv it my homegirl had the tongue groove oh my goodness shut it down or turn it up whatever blows ur hair back type of good she did say though she probly wouldn t get another cuz the balsamic sits in ur stomach we also got a yummy app some smoked marlin dish totally not what you imagine but none the less tasty however last time we got the salted mackerel app and that is way better either way hands down número uno spot on my place for beverages i stayed in scottsdale for weeks ate everywhere drank at many different places n nvisited this place twice i enjoyed a very excellent house punch the first time that had me waiting to return again n nsecond time i came i had a tour of three very different drinks there was actually a fourth but i didn t like it and the bartender graciously disposed of it and took it off my bill she was genuinely hospitable and gave me no anxiety over it i don t recall her name i just know that she s from nm originally her drinks were excellent i really appreciated that she understood my preferred flavor profiles and considered that i wanted to enjoy multiple contrasting drinks n nthe owner tended the bar as well a nice guy i thought her drinks were very well made but i noticed that the owner was coaching her over for example drinks that were a couple ounces short just a note of their attention to detail at this place n ni don t agree with the person who called this place hoity toity he s probably satisfied with phoenix s endless but competent beer and hamburger joints n nsince this is a review for rum bar i think stars is definitely appropriate but to comment on the food i had two entrees one of jerk chicken another of a sort of fish probably escovitch the rice a bit dry jerk chicken dry not flavorful enough but the service was excellent and they seated us minutes before their closing partner and i came here at on a thursday i had their soup of the day which happened to be a red snapper bisque and confused me greatly by being simply a seafood soup a bisque by definition is creamy nevertheless it came packed with spicy fishy goodness and whole peppercorns i think the chef got lucky that i really enjoy peppercorns and fish broth he came out later in the meal asked if i enjoyed it and said that he worried it would be too fishy nice guy btw n ntheir scallop appetizer was well cooked nice jerk sear on the outside almost gooey inside but rather pricey the jamaican spinach empanada was seasoned well and baked rather than fried but wasn t anything to write home about n nthe real highlight of the meal was the carrot juice and strawberry lemonade my partner and i ordered fresh and mostly local which i appreciate n nif i could i would give this review a star rating it wasn t quite but i ll give it the benefit of the doubt because we need more environmentally aware eateries that give their food a personal touch i love scallops and the scallops at the breadfruit were simply the best on the weekend the breadfruit is open till pm and its rum bar is open till midnight which makes this a great late night haunt pick your favorite rum drink and share a scallop appetizer for the perfect lite end to the evening the servers were excellent and handled my gluten allergy easily offering suggestions and slight modifications to the dishes the breadfruit is located at east pierce which is south of roosevelt and just east of first street put this place as a must on your late night hit list my go to place whenever i can spend a little money it is worth every penny i know i can order anything off the menu even if it something i ve never heard of because it is going to be prepared flawlessly nthere is no place that pays closer attention to the details my first impression of this place did not start off great my husband myself and a friend from out of town came for a lite dinner and wanted to be seated outside we waited about minutes to be seated once they finally told us our table was ready they sat us in the cigar room the cigar room has walls but no ceiling i guess you can consider that outside i dunno however there are no tables in the cigar room how were we supposed to eat we didn t want to wait any longer so we just made due one look at the menu and i was suddenly full wow is this place expensive for a cocktail i ended up ordering the non alcoholic carrot juice for it was actually really good we ordered appetizers to share between the of us we thought that would be enough seeing that each appetizer was about the appetizers ended up being more like samples i was somewhat embarrassed in front of my our guest we all had to fight over these tiny appetizers the only upside to the night was the carrot juice and the attentive server who kept refilling our free water n noverall i would recommend this place only if you want to spend some major dough and still be hungry when you leave my wife and i went here last night with our baby girl the restaurant was mostly empty at about pm on a thursday night it has a small urban restaurant decor with brightly colored walls and photos of jamaican locals and items the windows were filled with little glass votives with tea lights in them the people in the kitchen and the waiter were friendly and greeted us on the way in and thanked us on the way out n nwe ordered the sorel and some drink made with mangoes mint and tea for drinks the jerk chicken and the escovitch fish and festival for our entrees we skipped the appetizers to save room for dessert i like the sorel but my wife thought it was too spicy for her tastes it has a very strong ginger taste to it we both liked the mango mint tea drink the jerk chicken was good i didn t think it was too spicy at all it definitely left a presence on the tongue but nothing that was unbearable or really unexpected the escovitch fish was supposed to be spicy as well per the waiter but it wasn t as spicy as he made it out to be my wife really liked the bread sticks with the vanilla scent we had the sweet potato bread pudding for dessert and had to order seconds it has a nice crunchy coconut top which contrasts wonderfully with the soft inner bit n nthe menu overall is limited but i didn t think this was a problem portions are appropriate and not overwhelming in size so you don t feel like a blimp when you leave dessert wasn t large enough to split that or it was just really good the restaurant does have a byob alcohol policy so if you want a beer or some wine it s corkage fee for the wine and per bottle for beer most places i ve seen with a byob policy charge for wine the service was good only issue is that almost all the parking near by is metered so remember to bring some change for the meter i ve had the luxury and the pleasure to have eaten the best jamaican food prepared so i m a bit biased haling from flatbush ny where everybody and their mama is a chef oh and i ve had the opportunity to eat at an actually jamaican restaurant in jamaica i m more than biased n ni was hungry my hunny was hungry we were hot and tired of fast food so we decided to trek via the steel horse to this quaint restaurant ndecorum ndecorum paint job was nice yellow and green walls pictures of jamaican food local art jamaican paintings nice candles small tables nice environment for couples tables outside no one was outside because it was hot ass degree hell n bob marley is what i sang along to while i waited patiently for my food we held our breathe this is phoenix after all there are no jamaicans here so i thought nservice when entering the restaurant everyone behind the counter said hi i felt like i was at blockbuster they were as happy to see us as i was hungry to eat my food the lone waiter looked like a hippy not jamaican and i knew he wasn t jamaican because he had a new jersey accent and he was err um not black nthe food i ordered they brown stew chicken with rice and peas and huge heep of cabbage never had it prepared that way never want to eat a huge slimy hard to cut heap of cabbage again try shredding it please one red and one green pepper slice and to my dismay two puny slices of plantains yes i was disappointed for that is the best part of a jamaican dish i eyed my dates plate for his and he had his arms guarding his plate like a prisoner in jail so no not enough plantains the rice and peas tasted like indian rice it looked like indian rice in fact it was indian bismati rice the chef told me himself jamaicans dont eat bismati rice its too expensive they eat white rice with beans i was confused but i was hungry and i did eat it nno ginger beer available but the carrot juice was not so bad and the three dollar glass of ice tea was ok because my boyfriend ordered it but then he drank my drink because it was bleh n nliquor was available but read below why we didn t indulge n nthe prices pretty steep for a jamaican restaurant but i was hungry and not paying two meals and two drinks came to a whooping my boyfriend gave a measly three dollar tip mostly because he was a decent waiter and times are hard and because there were more staff there than customers and they were watching our every move n n nsynopsis surprisingly i ate everything on my plate my hunny ate everything on his plate and then tried to eat my food because he paid for it wink so it wasn t that bad the chef dropped by to ask me how my dining experience was i frankly asked about the rice was it basmati rice he said yes he explained in a nerdy hipster narrative that he knew the butcher who the killed the animals and the farmer who grew the veggies his lifestyle and how he was injecting ether to the restaurant scene in phoenix that is why i am giving the guy a break so instead of giving him a i will give him a you know what ill change it to because i m pmsing and like i said i am biased support the guy its quaint nicely located in downtown phoenix and he came all the way from to jamaica to hells kitchen to feed you wholesome well prepared jamaican food n n n n n what an awesome and quaint spot if i lived in az this would be my regular place to dine drink and light up a stogie one thing to note they open at pm on the dot we had rsvp for p and i could literally hear them check the time and not let us in until it was p exactly that was off putting but understandable off putting because we were the only people there min early and would have loved to sit at the bar for a while but understandable because they wanted to be ready for any crowd at anytime and we knew it opened at but anyway the food was a excellent a nice modern take on traditional jamaican fare everything needed a dash more salt to bring out the flavors more we ordered the ham hock and butter beans beans a bit more al dente than we like but the hock was smoked and cooked nicely the escovitch catch of the day was great requested more escovitch the jerk cornish hens were pretty good too just the right smoke and spice now onto the drinks rum punch of the day was a bit to medicine y for us but can i tell you the rum old fashion the pina colada and the velvet and vinyl are exquisite for dessert we opted for the rum cake which was rich and dense like a rum pudding nice consistency and flavor but by far the best part of the meal was the appetizer seared sea scallops we had several orders i guess i would be remiss if i didn t mention the atmosphere looks upscale but it s a very comfortable space the cigar area was cozy and the mural on the was was fantastic i wish i would have take a picture anyway i hope this was helpful do it their rum bar has now been open a while and flights are available i was never a rum aficionado too many rum n cokes when i was too young to care about such things and have now discovered a whole new world n nthe food has become nothing short of spectacular n nthe ambiance from the inside i can pretend i m in the west village circa by greenwich and horatio doesn t get any better than that i have been the the rum bar times before and the service was fine as was the food stopped by tonight and was meeting a friend for drinks i arrived early they told me i had to sit in the waiting area until my party arrived there was no one in the place yet i couldn t sit at a table and be served a drink or be ask to have a seat at the bar no i had to sit right by the door on a bench i went to turf around the corner where they welcomed my drink order while i waited for my friend n nway to pretentious for me i won t be back the best cocktails in phoenix great back patio to sit and sip an amazing drink the ingredients of each drink are very thought out no fake sugary mixes are used at times it seems like and uppity crowd but that doesn t matter once you try a cocktail sit back chill and listen to some reggae the tamarind ball and the handcart are my favorite drinks the best bread stick i ve ever had so good i ordered an extra to go it s refreshing to be able to get new cuisine and breadfruit fits the bill my other favorite part was the byob however don t listen to the server that says it s just a couple blocks away next time i ll be sure to bring my own vino first time visiting this bar on a saturday night and was not disappointed we arrived at the time of our reservation but our table wasn t ready yet so the hostess led us to their back patio where we could order drinks and wait for our table our waiter was friendly and good natured answering questions we had and making recommendations about drinks and the food once our table was ready we were promptly seated our drinks came out shortly thereafter and we also ordered some dishes to share my first drink was a hurricane charlie it was well balanced with the rum and fruit flavors i don t like passion fruit but the flavor wasn t overpowering the drink we also ended up getting a round of pina coladas and they were delicious i didn t try all of the food dishes but the jerk shrimp and johnny cake was delicious this is a hidden treasure an extremely romantic and soothing environment with delicious rum remedies candles really set the scene for an intimate outing it s so warm and welcoming that you would think you were right at home the food is nothing less than amazing it s surprising that they offer this caliber of beautiful and delicious meals for such a great price the waitress we had was very informative and suggested perfect items to try and ultimately fall in love with i would highly suggest going i had been wanting to try this place for a while and am so glad that i did first off i am no stranger to the caribbean jamaica or rum this is extremely creative food in a very hip funky space the staff has it going on very organized almost orchestrated to make your dining experience flow as smoothly as the sweet reggae music in the background we had small plates and then split an entree the plantains with a mango dipping sauce were terrific as were the scallops the heat of the scotch bonnet peppers was evident and went very well with the most excellent cocktails that they serve we had hemingway s daiquiri and the punch bowl special truly magical next came the jerk shrimp small plate and the jerk pork entree amazing shrimp that had a sweet hot fruity sauce around the bowl to go with the johnny cakes and a home made tarter sauce for the shrimp very good the jerk pork over polenta was a very creative dish not a large portion but we found it to be just right decided to have more cocktail before leaving for the symphony asked the waiter to bring me a sipping rum over ice he asked me a few flavor questions and a price range the range is from to yes two thousand five hundred dollars per glass the rum collection is vast and comes from all over the world the glass of rum arrived with a single large cube of ice and was the best rum i have ever tasted m had the velvet and vinyl which she loved we decided right then to return after the symphony for desert we did and sitting at the amazing bar she had a desert cocktail a sea salt and caramel rum desert drink that was wild and rum cake while i sipped another daiquiri i can t recommend this place strongly enough the bartenders will educate you about rum and you get to watch them make some great cocktails as well do go here and try it all wow breadfruit rum bar was an unexpected stop when we were in phoenix we had intended to visit another bar but we somehow got turned around and ended up here a total happy accident n nwe seated ourselves at the busy bar and were warmly greeted by both the bartenders and the patrons who seemed to be regulars there was light music playing in the background and everything about this place was totally at our pace n nour favorite drink was definitely the daily punch it changes yep exactly daily on this occasion the punch was light refreshing and had a great green bell pepper note sounds strange but was absolutely perfect n ni will definitely return when in the area this place was amazing my friends and i started a dinner club and this was the pick for our inaugural meeting i will refer to my friends as j and s n nwe sat outside on the patio and i recommend that if you visit when it s not too hot n ni ordered the tofu curry with jasmine rice and plantain it was amazing i usually don t like coconut curry but this was very good i will definitely order it again n nj ordered the jerk shrimp with pineapple corn and breadstick we had read that the jerk seasoning is very hot and we were warned inferno is a good way to describe it i love hot food so i didn t mind it at all when i tried it j paired the shrimp with the pineapple and found that it toned down the spicy to a manageable level and was a delightful combination i tried a bit of the breadstick and it was a sweet bread which was great to balance out the spiciness of the jerk shrimp n ns ordered the molasses chicken lollipops with red potatoes when her order arrived we all agreed that lollipops was an excellent description because the dish looked exactly like we expected i asked s for her opinion and she said the meat was good and the molasses added a nice sweet flavor that went with the name lollipop but was borderline overpowering the potatoes were good as were the vegetables but i could have used more than veggies on the plate n nwe all ordered the rum punch which is different every time this night it was a raspberry pink blend i enjoyed it so much i had two n nwe were warned that the portion sizes are smaller than other places the prices are higher than other places in the area but i believe that you get what you pay for i think that the quality of the food justified the prices n nour waitress margaret hit the sweet spot between being attentive without hovering she was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave good recommendations i eat out frequently i have dined at hundreds of restaurants and bars worldwide the service here was impeccable the entire staff including our server isaac were attentive friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu the food was eclectic well flavored and made from local ingredients they also have a great selection of rum i would recommend this restaurant for date nights business meetings or a casual get together my first trip to phoenix i was looking for the best food donwtown phoenix had to offer it is not the breadfruit aside from their nice lounge like interior it was awful the menu is limited and its my personal pet peeve for someone to call a green plantain a sweet plantain i m a vegan so they have one vegetarian option on the menu which i wasn t interested in so i asked if i could create a plate they said no because theyre flavors were expertly paired and the dishes were already made ha i wondered is it a tv dinner because if not you should have no trouble putting rice and peas plantains and greens on a plate i asked if a watermelon could be put in my mojito they said no like how hard is that i looked around to see if the business reflected all the no s i was getting and the place was empty mind you it was dinner time and its a dinner restaurant i finally ordered the avocado plantain spring rolls the bartender brought me out to menu items that i did not order and tried to convince me that i ordered them the spring rolls could have been good if the plantains were actually sweet i paid my bill and went over to the westin restaurant and had a great meal this is an attractive mid priced option for the downtown phoenix asu campus i went with a fellow foodie and a couple of newbies to food re the islands n nthe staff was very friendly and well kept the place was as well very attractive from the street and the interior is small and simple the food was good perhaps a little tame for true jamaican but very tasty and healthy n nwe had the spring rolls to start i would skip them next time and try one of the pies instead they let me taste the somekinda flower juice which tasted close to hibiscus juice and was a little strong to drink a whole glass of i settled for an imported ginger beet they also have a carrot juice concoction which involves vanilla and ginger which sounded good n nfor the meal i had the brown stew chicken my friends had the curry chick and jerk chicken i think mine was the best and def give credit to tiphanie b for the recommendation each plate came with sides which made the meal a lot of fun n ngreat location service and ambiance pretty good food not your down and dirty jerk shack but an excellent addition to the downtown scene and one of the only places open for lunch on saturday and sunday this is an amazing little treasure in downtown phoenix being from houston and frequenting nyc regularly breadfruit is the perfect little mix it is situated on a quiet street reminicent of midtown in houston the authentic food is so nyc spicy and savory i had the jerk shrimp and it rocked the spice was hot enough to satisfy my appetite the sweet potatoe pudding was a great way to top off the spicy shrimp the staff is super friendly and accomodating i loved the sidewalk bistro set up coffee is served in a french press between the charm and wonderful food i am going to crave this place all the way from houston holy f ing hotness i literally watched my date s eyes tear up and stream down his face repeatedly in unison with mine see after we took a trip to jamaica last year we foolishly assumed that no transplant restaurant in the middle of downtown phoenix could compare to the legitimate heat the actual island s dishes offered boy have i never been so wrong n nwhile the breadfruit s offerings are quite tasty i cannot stress enough that this place is not for the faint of heart after years of living in phoenix i add jalapenos and hot sauce to just about every single dish i eat and the spiciness the breadfruit threw my way totally kicked my ass i think we may have gone through pitchers of water over our minute meal at the end of the night my date s head was so overheated he actually felt his ears popping repeatedly note whether that was actually happening or my date was just a pussy we will never know n nanyhow on to the food i ve been hear several times now and am hooked on the jerk chicken plate and the jerk chicken salad i ve also had the scallop entree which while tasty and this pains me to say was just too freakin hot for me the jerk chicken is spicy as shit as well but the mango infused dressing and pineapple bites do a wonderful job of cooling your mouth i think i only needed pitchers of water my last trip n nthey recently opened up a bar next door called the rumbar this is what really excited me about this place over brands of authentic jamaican rum to choose from with all hand muddled ingredients to throw in their mojito is sugary and delicious n ni ve also been blessed with excellent service each time i went however i do have an issue with a particular duke of the breadfruit who is a freakin server there stop checking in to your work it s cheating n nnext time you need your sinuses cleared out look no further than the breadfruit i ll be the chick with empty water pitchers surrounding her plate the service was very friendly but horrifically slow and disorganized one waitress serving the entire restaurant plus she had to make coffee finish plating details we asked many questions about the menu when she returned to take our orders i ordered shrimp and then she informed me that they were not serving any shrimp dishes that day she could have told us that when we were seated and shrimp comprises about half of their menu duh n nfood was good not fantastic but solidly good the festival bread sticks were delicious we had an incredibly fresh piece of snapper that was really well prepared while i did not like the seasoning on the curry chicken the meat itself was very fresh and juice and did not taste like factory farm chicken but good free range meat its ok but nothing special drinks a little on high side with no drink specials food is ok something i can cook at home with some rum beef jerky and some bbq sauce and call it jamacian one word rum punch it is a flavor of the day type punch and all are amazing definitely make reservations because the location is tiny and i would recommend for more intimate parties the food is so incredible and unique i ve never had something i don t enjoy here did i mention the outside is a cigar patio so fun for the men i have been to the rum bar a few times in the past few weeks they have some pretty interesting cocktails i have had the watermelon cocktail pina colada rum punch their mixed punch stuff that s on the counter and the strawberry basilica my favorite was definitely the watermelon soooo good it is sweet yet light and refreshing the pina colada is a little too rich for me as they use coconut milk in it the strawberry is very good sweet but clearly alcoholic the punch that was on their counter last night was excellent it tasted like clove and fruit really interesting overall this place is great but here is my gripe last night we wanted to get some food but we were informed that they don t serve anything but apps in the bar area or outside and we couldn t get a table in the restaurant for another hours or so the waitress told us that they have a very small kitchen and that s why they do that we were fine with ordering apps and got the scallops the prawn flatbread and the avocado spring rolls the portion sizes were so small and the prices were so high for we got scallops after being told that they were good to share kind of ridiculous the scallops were excellent but i wanted more than one bite for the price the prawns were just alright and were more like a dip with pieces of bread than what i would typically think of when hearing flatbread aka pizza the spring rolls had a decent flavor but were mushy i will be back for drinks but i wouldn t order appetizers again i felt kind of ripped off i also am not sure why they can make these appetizers in their small kitchen and can t make some rice and beans or curry for the small amount of people in the bar oh well aruba jamaica ooh i wanna take ya bermuda bahama n nif you want any type of rum from any of the above cmon on pretty mama you don t have to go to kokomo but if you or you re amx is really pretty there is a year old appleton estate rum for per now if your pocket book isn t feeling oh so hemingway the breadfruit claims to have the most extensive rum menu in all of arizona and after seeing it for myself i happen to believe this claim the drinks here are all worthy starting as described by our attentive waiter as fruit forward to more heavy and serious and after dinner as the drink menu follows on the bartenders at the breadfruit have a romance with rum which is regarded as the most versatile spirit there is a rum punch of the day the evening we were there it was a light fruity rum concoction of hibiscus and roasted smoked pineapple the punch carried punch do not come expecting a full wine list here as there are only two from southern arizona this is a rum bar be prepared to take an uber the next drink i had for dinner in lieu of wine was a velvet and vinyl this drink was almost too pretty to drink the waiter delivered this deep pink to red libation to my table in a beautiful little glass don t be fooled by its beauty on first sip i decided to do just that sip it the velvet and vinyl is a beauty of appleton estate vx rum hibiscus liquor which is house made ginger pineapple lime bitters and a touch of rose mist if you are the dd on your night here don t worry there are nice libations that carry sans alcohol for you too n nkey largo baby why don t we go to kokomo n nspeaking of kokomo if you have ever been in the florida keys and had a corn fritter than you will appreciate some of breadfruits appetizers we noshed on the delicious salt fish fritter it was a flat fritter of cod fish served with a creme fraiche of dill and coconut there are two served warm on a plate and a good way to offset some of that rum before dinner n nmontego why don t we go jamaica n njamaican jerk the breadfruit and rum bar has that too for dinner i had the jerk pork and polenta a slowly smoked pork shoulder that had been marinated in rum what else jerk rub and smoked over pimento woods and served over tasty warm polenta and seasonal farm vegetables the pork is more of a pulled type dish over the polenta my date my husband also wanted to relive our vacation to the caribbean with some tastes of jerk and rum and opted for the pimento wood jerk chicken which was a huge serving of game hen smoked over pimento wood rubbed with house jerk rub and served over rice and small peas this dish had some spice to it it comes as a hen on a bone and was amazing the table of us being had various plates that included the blue mountain curried goat over basmati rice and it was said to be yummy and tender and looked like a generous portion the guava glazed pork belly was also ordered on our table and there were about slices of the pork belly two being super fatty with not much meat which can happen with pork belly and one reason i personally don t order it our friends ordered a dessert to share and for it was a super small ramekin of dessert which is a little on the pricey side to me whereas i felt the rest of the menu was on point for pricing the menu is ever changing and uses local farms and sources such as mayas farms wash ranch pillsbury wines and the meat shop just to name a few n na couple of things to know the breadfruit and rum bar is small make a reservation if you are having dinner we had a party of for our monthly little dinner club and were asked to secure with a credit card they will confirm on the day of the reservation and i like that there was a mix up with our reservation when we arrived despite the confirmation via telephone earlier in the day for what was to be a half and hour later than was logged into the reservation system when we arrived so i am glad we decided to arrive early for a drink there was also some confusion over wanting a drink at the bar and the girl wanting to take us out to the cigar area patio out back it all worked out and i didn t care either way because we ended up loving our waiter who carried us through the first drink to the last drink after our dinner was served parking is somewhat a bear in this area also allow time for that the patio should you want to sit out there for the cigar and rum manifest a separate menu all its own has patio heaters for the winter and is expansive n nour service from order to getting entrees was slow but my husband and i don t mind that after having lived in france and knowing that food is what makes social times the best the wait staff made up for the slowness ten fold anyway n n neverybody knows a little place like kokomo n well at least if you order that appleton estate vintage you will nye fix price menu was delightful great flavor combinations and rum pairings only question for other folks were you surprised like i was at gratuity automatically added as a service fee a friend recommended this restaurant through casual conversation almost a year ago so i bookmarked it and i am so mad it took me so long to try it n nmy cousin and wife were in town so per usual i wanted to try something new while they were here and the breadfruit did not disappoint our waitress was autumn like the season lol and she was amazing very knowledgeable about the menu with her descriptions and what we should try if we liked certain foods everything she recommended was great n nwe had the pimento wood jerk chicken jerk pork chop and the red striped curried prawns and there was no food left behind n nfor drinks she recommended the rum line and sugar and my cousin loved it i had the rock steady and it was refreshing ok i was a bit harsh last time to be fair that salad was really something awful i have been back once for just appetizers and again last night for a dinner date with the bf both times have been fan tastic last night we started with the scallops and a couple of drinks the scallops were amazing spicy and perfectly cooked the portion is a bit small though for the price big scallops for i ordered the pork belly and it was tender and delicious it came on top of a white bean mash with a sweet and spicy sauce so good the bf got the jerk pork with polenta oh em gee i could eat that everyday but i wouldn t of course looks around it was spicy spicy enough to make my nose run a little it was flavorful smoky spicy and savory the polenta was the perfect side to go with the meat too droooool for dessert we had the chocolate and orange souffle the souffle was very good molten and delicious chocolate with just enough orange flavor but the thing that made it rum whipped cream yes you read it right rum whipped cream it was perfect with the souffle and just such a good idea overall yes it is expensive but i had a fabulous time there it is cute and intimate and the food is awesome the service is great attentive but not too attentive i will definitely be back n n nps be sure to make reservations this place is tiny and gets booked up nice little low key place in downtown phx well except for the owner who was anything but low key in deciding where it was me and a colleague should be seated once he was pleased with our table it s going to get busy any minute now he assured us we checked out the menu and it looked good my friend was really happy with his jerk prawns and rice while i had the brown chicken stew which was really flavorful the only disappointment was the dessert their signature sweet potato pudd n was frozen if it s their signature award winning dessert don t you think they d at least make it fresh despite this i d go back to the breadfruit for a little taste of the carribbean in the heart of the desert a group of us dined at the breadfruit during a conference if there were a plethora of choices downtown we may not have tried it but we are glad we did n nwe had no problem getting a table relatively late on a tuesday night the restaurant is not particularly large for dining indoors and the outdoor space was closed there is a small and cozy bar area n nthe menu is varied with some traditional jamaican caribbean dishes like jerk spiced chicken fish cooked in a banana leaf and curried goat we were pleased to also find two creative vegetarian dishes the preparation is upscale this is not your hole in the wall kind of place the cocktails are limited to rum drinks including some classics made with rum and a couple of beers n nthe service was attentive and friendly if i were in the area again on business i d definitely check out breadfruit again a great caribbean jamaican menu and rum bar the restaurant was recommended by the hotel concierge at wyndham where a friend was staying while she visiting in phx we decided to try it out and were both very happy we did we shared plantain and avocado spring rolls for an appetizer excellent she had the jerk prawns and plantains for her entree and i had the brown stew chicken both excellent choices jerk prawns were very spicy as they should be brown stew chicken was mildly spicy as i preferred special on rum drinks made from scratch was great deal for a downtown restaurant i had a dark and stormy ginger soda and rum excellent we shared the ice cream parfait with raisins and cherry tart agar agar for desert so worth the extra calories nour server was terrific and very helpful good atmosphere cozy with just the right amount of mood music the rum bar connected to the restaurant is a nice alternative if you want to skip dinner and enjoy the tasty mixed rum drinks instead a nice cozy restaurant with a very nice staff the food was just ok it s like jamaican organic fusion it was a little to trendy and not enough food three years ago i received the worst service of my life i agree with one of the previous reviewers who stated that the waiters were very pushy my waiter acted very pretentious as he recommended every expensive dish on the menu he seemed disappointed when we did not order expensive drinks and food i ordered the jerk chicken which was semi decent but over priced i did not order the chef s special later my waiter brought the special by our table and basically said that we should have ordered the special he proceeded to walk away without making eye contact i felt like i was being harassed by him my girlfriend ordered the curry tofu plate her vegetables were burnt and her tofu looked like gruel all in all i would recommend that people go anywhere else in phoenix microwave meals in your own home would be a better option i wish i could give this place a negative star rating f for service and a d for food n nyeah just do not ever go here nstay away if this cocktail bar was in ny i would live inside it what a total gem i came here both nights that i was in phoenix and i wish i was in town longer just to come to this place a third time all the drinks i tried were phenomenal n ni have a tendency to always order drinks that sound good but end up being terrible to the point where i always have to drink the other person s drink however everything here was so good no matter what i ordered it was delicious i don t think a bad cocktail exists here n ncocktails are priced at and personally i thought that was extremely cheap because i m used to paying for something of this caliber so naturally i had to order as many different cocktails as i could and i loved every single one of them n nin addition to drinks i also had the rum cake and that was really good the flavors were really pronounced and the tanginess of the orange really permeated through the rum cake i don t like ginger so i had to take off the ginger on top but i can see why it was there n nparking hard to find free parking on weekends but you can park in the parking lot right behind the restaurant if you don t plan to stay for too long i was told you re not likely to get towed and luckily i wasn t even though i was there for several hours as i bar hopped healthy food the way it ought to be i do not think price is high when i can eat something totally healthy for my body and well being waiters are friendly and beverages are fabulous try carrot juice or seasonal fruit quencha entree was needless to say superb and veggies were grilled perfectly why would i ask a chef to cut a corn on the cob in half to share when it tasted so good unless i was with a cheap date i can buy it for her for only anyway i am not an expert on restaurants but i can wholeheartedly recommend the breatfruit for anyone who has exotic taste and his her palate is hot and spicy side one thing if you are used to eating junk foods including pita jungle s you need not to visit will go back again and again a holy hidden hideaway we sat at the bar and drank the punch bowl special x which is a sneaky little number because you literally can t taste the bacardi in it ni had to slow my roll and order the sweet potato puddin the restaurant itself i didn t have a chance to venture to but the bar was scenic and felt like we were far away from home we kinda were but i mean it felt like we were on a caribbean getaway sound corny see for yourself breadfruit is a cool spot the interior of the place is well decorated and they can only seat about people making a nice intimate ambiance i really appreciate that they serve locally grown organic produce and that their chicken is all natural and raised cage free any addition of a jamaican restaurant down town earns at least three stars in my book we arrived at pm and were the only people there throughout almost the entire meal n nwe brought our own bottle of wine and there was only a corking fee not to shabby n nwe started with the plantain and avacado spring rolls i really liked that wonton was baked and not deep fried the presentation was nice the mango chutney was fresh but the rolls themselves lacked flavor i really wished they would have paired some other fruit or spice to add more contrast to the dish n nfor my main i got the jerk chicken and i was a little disappointed again they did an excellent job with the presentation but the corn was mushy and what the jerk rub lacked in flavor they tried to make up for in spice i like spicy and can handle a lot of heat but heat shouldn t overpower flavor n nthe chef owner came out and asked us how we enjoyed our meal and explained his philosophy behind the food the service was excellent but in comparison to some other jamaican places i ve been it really only warrants stars sorry while cuisine is original tasty nicely presented service and policy flunk the test our wait person as well as the maitre d were obsessed with having us wait for our guest before seating this was at pm and the tables were half empty their waiting area is a padded bench with the comfort of a dentists waiting area staff and diners traipsing around nearly stepping on in your feet as you try to scrunch up to avoid them repeatedly we were pestered about when the third person would show finally we asked if we could please sit at the table and were treated to a harangue about how owner dwayne hope you re seeing this does not like to sit people until all guests arrive fine that s his choice ours is to skip breadfruit amazing food and cocktails the music is to die for if you are a reggae fan like me na perfect meal very cozy and romantic place for dinner or just drinks at the bar the bartender is the best very knowledgeable about the liquor and even its history we always sit at the bar because we enjoy talking to the bartender and learning food is amazing and delicious too it s not the best carribbean restaurant i ve been to but i did like that they had some unique items on the menu the rum glazed prawns with roti were good the mussels dish came with tons of mussels and a flavorful broth the dessert was a disappointment but i would give it another try and try another item if i am in phoenix again hearty simple and to the point n nwhen i think of jamaica i think of a simple way of life that still has a bite to it the breadfruit is a wonderful reflection of that the dishes aren t presented in a flashy manner nor is the ambiance posh however the flavor is the focal point and that point is well taken n nthe jerk chicken is my favorite dish the chicken is so damn moist on the inside while the jerk seasoning on the outside brings tears to your eyes wonderful i wasn t that impressed with the drinks and i tried the food to be so so nothing that knocked my socks off nservice was hit or miss i had to keep flagging down our server to get another drink or put in an order of food ni don t think i d ever go back again had a nice family dinner here staurday night it was delicious nour server was very helpful nice she suggested several menu items they were spot on nwe started with the plaintain avocado spring rolls some patties the spring rolls were ok not enough flavor for me we ordered a spinach pattie and a fish pattie the fish pattie was amazing the fish was spicy and the pattiy crust flavorful flaky the spinach pattie was hearty and the flavor was decent but def not as good as the fish pattie nwe ordered entrees jerk shrimp jerk chicken curried lamb nthe jerk shrimp was spicy perfectly cooked i loved it nthe jerk chicken was flavorful but the shrimp was better more heat etc nthe curried lamb was off the chain i mean soooo good melt in your mouth tender great flavor served with acorn squah stuffed with sauteed greens its was a great mix of flavors and textures nfor dessert we had blue mountain coffee which was served with coconut cream unsweetened nice touch and the sweet potato ginger pudd n the pudd n had a good flavor full of raisins but was a little dry the a la mode was prob the way to go as the extra liquid wouldve help the dessert noverall stars very cute inside super small but not overcrowded cant wait to go back can t believe i haven t written a review yet so i live walking distance to rum bar so it s a staple in the neighborhood rum is the name of the game and anejo wil be to blame n nthere will be no rum and cokes in this place the owner who will always great you at the door will help you expand your palate with a craft cocktails or flight of rums n nmy favorite drinks have been the swizzle and they make a great dark stormy work yourself through the rest of the specialty cocktails you won t be disappointed n nhave only had some apps and desert here the spring rolls scallops and the parfait have been excellent n nthe abuelo yr has been a great sipper and compliments many of the dishes rum bar reminds my of nyc and it s a pleasure to sit and soak up some good conversation with friends food was amazing we ordered the jerk chicken and beef brisket also we started with the scallops but no photo to show lol they were really good the drink i ordered was the kingston and it really was like drinks very fruity and strong he ordered the old fashion really liked it they are changing their menu for the season so we are excited to see what they add had issac as a server and man does he know everything there s not an question that could throw him off well got to say i m not much of a rum drinker but this is a place to eat that too drink wife and i came here as a farewell dinner before we return home from visiting az you got to get the house rum drinks nice with pleasant taste and smooth if weather is nice eat outside to enjoy good food and nice caribbean music also splendid service by the staff mmmmm breadfruit n nyour jerk chicken plate is awesome a full plate to stimulate the palate grilled pinapple for the smoky sweetness cole slaw for the acid jerk rub on the chicken for the spicy juice chicken for the savory a bread stick for the crispy and salty n nreally a fantastic dish my chicken wasn t dry at all i ll be back for dinner and will be bringing a bottle of wine with me as well the drinks were great but very expensive was very disappointed with three out of four meals the food is really not that great jerk chicken game hen was not very flavorable nor was the jerk pork the small plate of pepper shrimp was good be prepared to spend a lot if you want more than one drink went there by recommendation of the barista at the nearby fair trade coffee and was very pleased n nstopped in to grab a quick lunch not sure exactly what i was getting into the server was quick to offer assistance drink recommendations when i ordered my food the vegan curry i asked for water instead of buying one of their exotic dishes after a couple minutes of the water not arriving i started to get annoyed but then it came out with my lunch which was impressively fast fast enough that i completely forgave the slowness of the water n nthe food was excellent i thoroughly enjoyed every bite and then it got better a woman a cook i believe came out and explained to me that it was unique type of organic tofu that has to be ordered directly from jamaica and one serving alone has about grams of protein in it she was very friendly and very pleased to hear that i was enjoying my meal and our short conversation made me enjoy it even more n noh and they allow you to byob too just one per person but that s still pretty awesome in my opinion very cool place rum old fashioned is dangerously tasty would have given five stars if the jerk chicken wasn t made with cornish hens it tasted awesome but the effort to get meat of those little bones was a bit much butter bean app was very good too will be back i ve had mixed experiences at the breadfruit rum bar before but this last one has pushed me to the maybe come for drinks but definitely not food category n nthe problem is the service and the speed at which the food comes out now i understand if the restaurant is busy that it may take the kitchen a little longer to get the orders out but to wait hours before any food hits the table is beyond ridiculous the waitress never kept us abreast as to what the hold up was and we had to hunt her down in order to find out what happened to our order when we finally got to her she went and checked with the kitchen and said it d be more minutes more than minutes later the food came this situation could have easily been handled by a letting us know that the kitchen was very backed up and b offering to bring us something to eat in the interim neither of those things happened so we were left twiddling our thumbs in hunger for waaaaay too long by the time the food finally arrived everyone was a bit cranky so the joy of the atmosphere had been spoiled n nit s really too bad because the food once you actually get it is actually quite good we had the guava pork belly red curry shrimp and jerk pork and all were quite delicious same goes for the drinks if you re a rum fan and particularly a caribbean rum fan then you will absolutely love the cocktail menu they even serve a rum punch of the day which the bartenders change daily so that is always fun n ni wish we had had a better service experience at the breadfruit but alas it was not to be had and without a beach view to distract me from the unnecessarily long wait for food this has pushed me overboard and is probably the final time we visit the island food at the rum bar '"
