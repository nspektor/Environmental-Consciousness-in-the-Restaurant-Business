       "' save your money and time it took over an hour just to get our lunch served and there wa hardly anyone in the restaurant even after expressing to our waiter that we were in a rush n nordered off the basic taste of the island menu the ripped banana wa not only ripped but petrified and tasteless not impressed especially for a restaurant near the asu downtown campus lot of other place that serve good quality food at a reasonable time the restaurant is quaint very pretty unfortunately the food is not a good a the place look and the price are not to put with the food either too pricey for a mediocre meal the pork chop is so tough you would expect a soft cut and such but they didn t cook it well t wa like eating shoe leather the crab cake are just bread barely any crab such a rip off they should invest on providing quality food having such a cute place the server wa confused and scattered my whole party wa unimpressed with the food would not recommend for food but only for drink and the ambience heard about the breadfruit in an article in az vine wine it sounded so good we couldn t wait to try it it wa outstanding the drink the service the staff wa amazing the food just incredible we can t wait to go again highly recommend it nwe just moved here from the east coast we are trying a many rest a we can nthis place is a must after year of visiting the rum bar for cocktail we finally got the chance to try the breadfruit for dinner i wa so impressed by the excellent service my water glass wa never empty i wa given a fresh set of silverware between course and all of my question were promptly answered n ni got the red stripe curry prawn with rice and roasted vegetable the spice wa perfect they are known for their jerk spice after all n nmy partner got the jerk pork and polenta and said that the ratio between pork and polenta seemed a little off but wa otherwise very tasty i went to the breadfruit last night for dinner my mussel were absolutely delicious and so were the fresh rum cocktail they made however warning the menu is pricey and the portion are small i wa still hungry when i left and i am a lb female it doesn t take much to make me full my suggestion go here for drink apps go somewhere with adult sized portion for dinner breadfruit is honestly one of my favorite spot in phoenix my fiancé and i frequently come here whether it be to just enjoy a cocktail or have a delicious meal and romantic date night i highly recommend getting the scallop they are always perfectly cooked and i ve never been anywhere that serf a scallop dish that even come close to what breadfruit offer service is also always incredible i came here a few week ago for my birthday the server were nice the food wa good the rum punch wa excellent the portion were a nice size we had the coconut curried tofu smoked fish cabbage canape sorrel etc the rum menu is amazing they use local produce organic ingredient and i love the chic environment i must admit i wasn t too keen on the host up front he wa a bit abrasive to my guest so you lost one star for that but overall we had a good time in the outside patio and i would return to try some other thing took a friend here yesterday a she s new to town and hasn t yet experienced all downtown phoenix ha to offer told her i thought breadfruit had some of the best food and drink in downtown phoenix she said wa curious about the place but wa always reluctant because it had a low yelp rating so i came on here to see what wa up n nyes they make the food the way the want without substitution cocktail are mixed the way they please too yes you cannot eat on their back patio boo hoo yes they only seat whole party not all that uncommon n nget over it people you want great well balanced flavor and innovative rum cocktail i recommend the shorty make reservation you won t regret it delicious i ll be back for second and third and fourth n nin quintissential phoenix style breadfruit is housed in an unassuming small space in a nondescript neighborhood close to the heart of downtown the space itself need a little more character and decor to qualify for true phoenix hidden gem status at the moment but it s only the first week of it existence so time will tell n nstill i wa sold at first glance of the menu lot of stuff i ve never heard of with description that all tempted the taste bud i decided to zero in on the brown chicken stew which is actually not a stew at all but however you want to describe it it wa damn tasty a a starter my friend and i also split a two dollar chicken curry patty which i d describe a a cross between the crust of an apple le apple turnover a samosa and chicken curry yum i could see myself going back just to eat another one of those alone n na small complaint one that i don t often have at american restaurant that are addicted to overstuffing their obese customer concern the portion size i do like and favor smaller portion at any restaurant i go to but the brown chicken stew wa just so good that it left me wanting just a notch more also beware if you re new to this particular entree a i wa because the chicken contains bone n nthe service is alright the waitstaff struck me more a just a bunch of dude a opposed to professional waiter waitress but the dude we had wa perfectly friendly n nanother great addition to the downtown scene i suggest they consider expanding their friday and saturday night hour though very hard place to locate the building is shadowed by tree and they dont do take out rum bar is such a neat little place their mojitos are some of the best i ve had in phoenix they contain large sprig of fresh mint and good rum i ve tried some of other drink and they were fine but i don t like to deviate too far from my beloved mojito i love to sit on the patio during the cooler month and pretend i m in a place other than phoenix this place wa a terrible disappointment tonight they have made their portion smaller and more expensive the staff wa inexperienced and insensitive leaving u hanging most of the night overall sad what this place ha become we love this place every time ha been awesome the food the drink the service just great go when i wa little i wa a very picky eater i liked what i liked and would throw a fit if i had to eat something on my do not eat list but something changed a an adult now i am much more adventurous when it come to food except for ketchup i still can t eat that stuff n nso when it come to trying new restaurant and food i am more than happy to take a risk and that is what led me to breadfruit yeah jamaican food isn t like a culinary feat and although i love cuban food a cousin to jamaican food you could say i d never ventured to the spicier side of caribbean cuisine but wow i m so glad i did n nit wa a lovely friday afternoon when a work friend suggested we head over to breadfruit for a long leisurely lunch and i must say breadfruit wa a great antidote to a stressful work week after waiting just a little too long for our menu we were greeted by a friendly waiter who gave u some recommendation on drink my friend had the carrot coconut juice he love his carrot juice so he wa thrilled they had it on the menu and loved every sip of it i on the other hand just had their house iced tea they had a lot of other beverage option i just wanted to avoid something too sweet n nthere wa a decent selection of menu choice and everything sounded delicious so it wa tough for me to decided which meal would whet my appetite my friend had the jerk chicken which he said wa spicy of course but fantastic i had the brown stew chicken and in my best rachel zoe it wa ba na na the chicken wa cooked wonderfully and the flavorful sauce wa so complex and delicious my taste bud sang a glorious hallelujah n ni can t wait to go back and try more from their menu i wa totally eying the plantain avocado spring roll love plantain and love avocado so i know i would love this and i wa really wanting to try the curried chicken dumpling but i wa afraid if i had that for lunch i would be in a food coma for the rest of the day n nyou know a place is good while during your first visit you are already planning what your next meal will be so for that reason alone i d say it wa another great culinary adventure for me yeah the food here is delicious excellent curry and bean and rice my only gripe is that they were not family friendly i have never been in a restaurant that would not make small accommodation for a child here s the deal we asked for the fruit and veggie that go into one of their salad but not the full salad and the answer wa a rather abrupt and unapologetic no so we ordered the full salad with the dressing on the side with to obvious intent to give the fruit and veggie to my child and guess what the salad came out all mixed up then the server watched u pick all the food and veggie out of the salad and said not a thing n ni have never experienced such appalling service i certainly will not go here again no matter how good the food best scallop everrrrrr i m telling you they will change your life all the food i ve had here ha been awesome they had an insane amount of rum choice and the bartender are very knowledgeable and will give you pointer if you tell them what you like they make great mixed rum drink but even sipping on some of the nicer rum they have is a fun experience it seems like they ve had a lot of bartender turnover but i ve also seen a lot of them get trained and they do a great job of teaching them about the rum food service etc if i wa rating it just on food or drink i d give them star a million time over the service can sometimes be sketchy when they re busy though which is frustrating considering it s certainly not an inexpensive place to eat and drink based on my one dinner i would eat here everyday if i could i want to try everything it is a vegan paradise now i ve never been to jamaica so i don t know the real deal but i ve been to caribbean restaurant n nwe shared the avocado plantain spring roll but i think we could have each finished our own they were simply that good the person i went with usually eats like a bird barely taste her food and leaf food over not here unless you consider a vulture a bird wow i ve never seen her go for food like this n nshe ordered the pop cho and sweet ginger loved it and finished the entire serving didn t care for the cabbage side which she found too peppery note that the sweet potato that come with this dish is actually a regular potato prepared sweetly so adjust your expectation it s still qute good she liked my dish too but said hers wa better a bit competitive too n ni had the coconut curry tofu it had amazing and unique taste absolutely delicious n nunfortunately we had no room for dessert but i have no doubt i ll be back again soon for more n nthis will soon be part of the pre theater rotation rude staff and pretentious food upon arriving there for the first time we were seated immediately we were asked if we had ever done there before when replying no we are then spoken to like we were child granted it wa our first time but not the first time we ve been out to dinner and definitely not the first time i ve been to a jamaican restaurant n nwhen trying to order a drink the waitstaff insisted we have the daily punch even after asking about several other drink on the menu we were directed to the daily punch when i tried to order an item off the menu i wa told that that s a different plate on friday and saturday with a price tag higher huh n nwe were there exactly one hour before the entrées came out everyone sitting around eye had received their entrées and or had already left when the food came out it wa absolutely delicious but the portion were small leaving me hungry which almost never happens the waitstaff we re just not friendly enough and definitely did not make u feel welcomed n nwe won t be back i know many place on the east and west coast that have even better food for half the price and have genuinely happy people working there the ital food wa so good the atmosphere wa cool and welcoming great food incredible service perfect ambiance for a romantic date n nour server wa sweet and knowledgable and recommended our appetizer strongly suggest the rockfish ceviche i ordered the jerk chicken which wa a bit too spicey and i like spicy food but it wa still delicious my guy loved his prawn too it wa great the service wa seriously commendable everyone wa so on the ball loved it and will be back authentic chic and inventive n nthis cocktail list really take the love of rum to a new level the category or course are meant to be savored our server for the evening explained his favorite a well a the daily punch bowl my husband opts for the punch bowl and i start my journey down permanent brain cell damage i hear they grow back n nwe wait in the booth inside during this warm night for our friend to arrive around pm or so once she arrives luke i think our server take u to our table and continues the amazingness n nmy adventurous husband invite luke to bring suggestion including a unique smoked pineapple rum concoction a it wa our friend birthday he brings a huge rum sniffer and a shot if some fabulous rum he really made our experience at this local gem memorable update nwe went back to breadfruit last night and i must revise my original review to reflect our experience which deserved more star n nwhen we arrived at pm on saturday night the place wa packed there wasn t enough room to push two table together in order to accommodate our party of so we walked around the block until some table were open the waitress wa extremely nice and we were seated about minute later n nfor appetizer we ordered the avocado spring roll and the roasted plantain despite being small portion they were both very good i wa inspired to go get some plantain in the asian market this morning in order to try to make them at home n na an entree i ordered the curried tofu again i wanted to try something else the ital soup or the veggie patty but they were out of a vital component of each dish and they don t make the soup in the summer n nwhen my entree came out i wa initially really disappointed to see that they had made it with chicken again i asked the waitress and she assured me that what i wa seeing wa actually a soy product and i had nothing to worry about i must say it wa disturbingly uncomfortably meat like so much so that i made my husband try it and tell me that it wa in fact non meat before i would put it in my mouth when i did eat it it even had the texture of meat very disconcerting the flavor wa excellent and i would definitely order this entree again if i can get over the extremely realistic meat analog the side were good definitely better flavor since last time especially mixed with the curry sauce n ni have to issue a heartfelt apology to wayne and the breadfruit for the disparaging review that i wrote after my last visit i should have called to ask about the dish and had them clarify that my dish wa in fact fake meat it ha been so long since i ate chicken and i don t generally eat fake meat that i truly thought it wa meat lesson don t assume anything n nmy dinner companion all ordered a chicken dish and all enjoyed them thoroughly i tried the festival breadstick from someone s meal and i have to say that breadfruit should offer a basket of those a an appetizer yum n nwhen we were almost finished with our meal the waitress brought u full sized sample of the carrot juice another yum it tasted a lot like thai iced tea similar seasoning and very rich and creamy n ni will definitely go back to breadfruit the food wa good festival crack the atmosphere and the service is excellent and it is close to home n nhome run breadfruit n n ndowntown phoenix need a jamaican restaurant and an ethiopian italian mexican etc and i have waited anxiously for breadfruit to open riding my bike by there every afternoon for week looking for any sign of life n nfinally just this week i see people eating there so we went for lunch today at at the end of the lunch rush of course we arrived at the exact same moment a phil gordon i think we threw them off a little bit by ordering our meal to go but they don t get a by for that n nthe wait wa long minute but they were really busy and they just opened and the mayor wa there so it wa understandable we forgave the lone waiter brought me a fiji water it tided me over slightly n ni wa excited to see several vegan option on the menu mostly side but it look like some of the entree can be modified to fit vegetarian requirement n ni ordered the curried tofu that is the name printed on the menu no modification which come with side of steamed plantain bean rice and steamed cabbage green bell pepper n nunfortunately i recieved curried chicken a fact that i discovered after getting back to my office and i wa way too starving to go back to get it fixed i ate around the chicken something i am normally loathe to do but a i said starving n nthe bean and rice bland nothing spectacular they were just that bean and rice n nplantains undercooked just slightly i wanted them to be so much better than they were n ncabbage green bell pepper boring they were just steamed cabbage and green pepper i love cooked cabbage but with salt please n nnothing that i ate wa seasoned at all i had bite or two of the curry sauce since it wa touching the rice starving and it tasted ok am i allowed to pas judgement on a sauce that wa poured over something i don t ever eat because i think it is disgusting it hard to say n nadmittedly i would have enjoyed this meal a lot more if i had recieved a meal that did not contain meat n ni will probably go back breadfruit is new and they deserve another chance i will definitely eat in and i will try david s reccomendation of the avocado roll n none strike they haven t struck out just yet this place ha amazing food and phenomenal cocktail explain your preference to the server and they will suggest something matched to your taste one of my favorite date night spot for special occasion the food and drink are amazing and unique this is a hidden gem and it s on my permanent referral list for place to try in phoenix n ngreat drink ngreat food ngreat atmosphere n ni ll be back incredible food and rum i can not express what a lovely experience we had for apps and outrageously delicious drink wish i lived in phoenix i have now gone back twice daryl is an excellent addition to restaurant entrepreneur in the historic district of phoenix giving u more rum than anyone could possibly consume nhis street chicken jerk chicken is spot on not too spicy and edible by anyone s palate nmy wife is not the biggest fan of jamaican cuisine but she still return at my request if only the staff paid a little more attention to the patron each time we go we tend to wait for service on ordering throughout the evening this wont stop u from returning though the food is just too good huge selection of rum and unique cocktail prepared by a very knowledgeable bartender the rum flight are a great way to taste the different type of rum this is a great lunch place in downtown phoenix and i am happy to say i am now a fan it took a while but they have it right now from when it first open to now it a total nthe menu is updated and the food is delicious neverything on the menu is flavorful and i can not complain oh and i love the plantain and their carrot coconut juice went to this place for the first time on a recommendation from a work colleague i had the whole black bass and it wa excellent the rum drink were also great i wa in phoenix for a week best meal i had this trip n nthis place is walking distance from all the big hotel in downtown phoenix in a safe neighborhood no taxi needed each time i ve been here the food ha been lick the plate of every drop amazing the cocktail are also great the service can be slow but i haven t found the service to be bad i m headed there again this week i wish there wa a touch more elbow room in the restaurant but that s about it i went to breadfruit a few month ago and waited until now to post it to keep myself from saying anything too mean i went with my boyfriend and had the worst service nthe server kept just wandering back and forth between the kitchen and dining room without doing anything we had to try several time every time we wanted to get his attention also a note on the menu i am extremely pick i know this so i try to keep it in perspective i have been a vegetarian since i wa and do not like meat at all i ordered the tofu but when it came out it looked more like chicken and the texture wa like chicken i asked my boyfriend to try a piece and he thought it wa chicken a well after several attempt we got the server s attention and asked him if he wa sure they made tofu and not chicken by mistake this is where our serf becomes unbelievable the guy actually yell at me that it is not chicken it is tempeh not chicken tempeh is a soy product but is not tofu it should not be listed a tofu on the menu if it had been listed correctly on the menu i would not have ordered it because i already know i do not like it ni did not know how to react i ended up just eating the rice and the server ignored u the rest of the meal he came back to pick up the plate noticing i did not eat it and didn t say a word or offer to take it off the bill it then took u another minute at least to get him to pick up the bill i will never go back here two word the worst i just came back from jamaica a few week ago and i had a crving for some real jamaican food seafood over cooked way over priced and i guess you have to drink alcohol to get good service i wish i would ve checked yelp first i went here on a recommendation my bad won t happen again they have some of the best cocktail in town ask for bryan the bar manager and he ll pick your poison some of the best drink i ve ever had more rum than you could ever imagine do the drink course staff and atmosphere are superb i only sit at the bar so i can watch the bartender master create the awesomeness that are their drink food wa superb but i go there for the drink and atmosphere a girlfriend of mine brought me to this really cool place the ambiance is great a very jamaican feel good music good atmosphere and amazing drink their bartender bryan is so passionate about his work and make the absolute best drink i have ever had you have to make sure that you have him make you a sugar foot or classic mojito a very refreshing smooth delicious drink he will not disappoint you bryan thanks for making it impossible to have a regular beverage now i crave your drink and have been back multiple time just for them keep mixing those wonderful beverage i had the opportunity to visit breadfruit in the company of a good group of friend who were all willing to share bite of the dish they ordered i brought a bottle of champagne to share and it seemed all of my friend brought bottle of liquid treasure themselves we had so much to drink that the champagne didn t get opened with a reasonable corkage fee of it wa easy to bring a ton of wine n nfor an appetizer we shared the plantain avocado spring roll they were so so nothing overly impressive to me i wa actually wishing for a spicy sauce to dip them in for my entree i had the brown stew chicken dish it s a marinated and sauteed chicken dish served with rice with pea and some steamed veggie again no spice with the dish i actually asked for some hot sauce to go with the dish despite the lack of heat it wa still very flavorful and i enjoyed it n ni would like to give breadfruit another try i think their simple menu lends for getting a dish just right and making it well i look forward to trying their other menu item this is a review of the bar only i ll review the food another time the thing is the bar is the star here we return to this little gem again and again because the craft cocktail are hand down the best in phoenix n nevery drink on the menu is hand crafted with the utmost gourmet style and fresh house made impeccably sourced ingredient n nthe bar staff is faultlessly trained and knowledgeable not to mention friendly and welcoming if you re lucky you ll get to witness a training session the owner imparts the history of rum from all over the world to his team he know every nuance from how they are made and aged to how to pair them in way your palate ha never experienced n nit s a flavor adventure no matter what you order but try the rum old fashioned it s the best we ve ever had honorable mention to the piña colada it s absolutely outstanding not too sweet like most others you ve had and the real coconut both in the mix and a a garnish make it transcendent n non a cool evening try the from scratch hot buttered rum it s so rich luscious and complex you ll be transported to an island paradise breadfruit is a restaurant that always try their best the staff is always friendly they do a wonderful job of serving what is in season when they have a seasonal drink available you should try it you will not be let down the jerk dish are spicy but delicous if you haven t had the escovich patty they are amazing on friday and saturday there can be a wait especially for group i wanted so much to love this place but it just didn t happen for me i think upon entrance of the restaurant and le than warm greeting mind you they weren t even busy i wa like sigh n nwe had the rum glazed prawn and roti flatbread which wa the tastiest of our selection we then had the plantain and chutney dip escovitch fish and festival entire whole snapper and i had some sort of soup i wanted more flavor more authenticity everything wa just okay and for the price i would have expected more everything about this restaurant wa incredibly the server were great the rum drink wa out of this world i had an appetizer and then the salmon the whole meal wa fantastic little bit on the expensive side but it wa well worth it if i could give this place zero star i would but since i have to give a minimum of one the only plus in this place wa the food i ve been in the restaurant industry for year and this is by far one of the strangest experience i ve ever had n nmy beautiful bride and i walk in and ask for a table for two when they open bartender say do you have reservation not one person in the place host say next time please try to get reservation minute later still the only one in the restaurant n none of the waitress tried to bring something behind the bar and i actually heard the bartender yell at her to get it out from behind the bar n nour server came over to take our order when my wife ordered the salmon she wanted the sauce on the side the server said no i asked why she couldn t have it on the side she said because there are no substitution a you can read at the bottom of the menu n ni can honestly say again that i ve never experienced anything like this in my life we will never be going back stumbled upon this place a while back and wa pleasantly surprised it s a small clean place that seemed a bit unassuming but friend and i decided to stop in boy i m glad we did the carrot juice wa great always love a place that offer ginger beer and the brown chicken stew wa sooooo good wish i had room for dessert but i wa pretty stuffed by the end n none thing i don t recommend is the plantain and avocado spring roll it just becomes a strange flavorless mush in your mouth but don t let that dissuade you from trying this place out because then you d be missing out we went on a friday night without a reservation and had a le than minute wait it s a very nice and cute spot and the vibe is fun and eclectic we got seated but ended up having to call another waiter to see where our waiter wa in the midst of good conversation we did not realize that no one had come to the table to get our drink order for or so minute n ndrinks were ordered and were absolutely amazing my colleague liked her salmon dish and i ordered the jerk chicken it wa very good and flavorful but the rice and bean turned it all off for me the rice wa super dry which made the dish harder to eat i ve had better jamaican food so if you try jerk chicken here and aren t pleased try it again somewhere else perhaps more authentic my girl and i have eaten here for year despite the little negativity here and there they won tnlet you order to go food waiter reluctant to bring table salt etc nwe decided to eat there about a week and a half ago when we arrived it wa about an hour prior to closing there were table open on the patio when we asked about sitting on the patio the host literally grimaced then explained that there wasn t seating for two on the patio nan hour before you close multiple table open outside on a thursday night really nso rather than dignifying the host response with an oh okay i said thanks we ll check back then finished that sentence to my gf with when hell freeze over n nso nwe actually walked right around the corner to pomo pizzeria and were served a world class meal had an awesome server were greeted by the chef himself because he brought u a complimentary dessert nall without ever hearing a word about how the breadfruit employ treated u earlier n nlast nwe drove past the breadfruit on our way and saw that the open table were now guess they don t care about our silly top but hey nkeep up that rep guy went to the breadfruit for lunch today and am sad i ve never been here before it wa so delicious my both my meal and my wife s wa to die for the atmosphere is also really nice with some good reggae playing and the service wa excellent i will definitely be going back for more the food is fine and the drink are excellent but the restauarant s policy towards small party is not acceptable my wife and i frequently dine out and am are very disappointed when the restaurant staff seat small party at the worst table breadfruit is quilty of this the last time we were there we refuse the table offered and requested another table that wa empty but the staff indicated that wa saved for a larger party later in the evening one last chance for breadfruit we called for a reservation for a specific table but were told that table is only for larger party not for diner that would be okay if some of the smaller table were placed in better location in the restaurant we decided to take our business to other restaurant that appreciate their customer i recently went to my first first friday and my first trip to downtown phoenix after a few hour at the phoenix art museum friend and i hopped on the light rail and tried a new restaurant enter the breadfruit n neasy to find sign on the street corner on a charming and quiet little street sits the breadfruit with a hostess standing out front greeting guest you can see the very intimate seating area from the street and it wa packed a good thing for pm on a friday night we sat and waited outside at the cute little table way too hot to eat a full meal outside we were offered menu to peruse while we waited about minute for a table n ninside we ordered two mixed drink a mojito vanilla for me they were strong and very good the mojito wa very minty and refreshing and my mojito loving friend said he should have ordered a mojito read get a mojito n nthe food we split a tilapia patty very spicy for an appetizer patty are jamaican empanadas ni had the coconut curried tofu with rice and pea ripe plantain and veggie this is the one of the best tofu dish i have ever had my only complaint is that breadfruit need to have more plantain per plate they are so good none friend had the curried chicken and dumpling with a green banana veggie plantain and a side order of rice and pea although he didn t like the whole wheat dumpling he loved the curry sauce and the green banana he called the sauce delectable n noverall this is a great place small but great the drink are strong the food is great and the serve is prompt our only regret are not enough plantain and we should have gotten dessert let me tell ya breadfuit ha really got my goat no really they offer a local mountain goat dish on their menu offering meat and produce from local or at least from sustainable farm this snug retreat ha you loungin you in da island mon n narriving in a sand colored seemingly residential area i wa surprised to see the glowing rum sign eureka i wa in the right place nautical rope lead you to the front door opening on the lounge area and impressive rum collection over variety in fact cozying up in the corner to get a good shot for you lovely yelpers and someone possibly staff proceeded to ignore my positioning and squashed me between the door and the brick wall eiy after i got over my self importance i complimented the rum punch bowl and followed our waiter ryan to our table pour duo at pm on a wednesday night we were two of five people in the joint which is good because it s a pretty small space n nsetting to the menu i had to hold back my surprise the price before me were a bit higher than the online menu nonetheless i knew what my order wa destined to be the blue mountain curried goat with farm veg blue mountain curry marinade and basmati rice when do you get that opportunity in new england the dish wa flavorful sweet and spicy and plate licking good and plentiful but i doubt that you d be able to resist the temptation to scoop up every last bite n nnot into goat how about rum the cocktail menu is just how i like it in course each concoction offer freshly squeezed juice tonic made in house like soda stream aaaaand massive block of ice suck up a lot of space in the glass but at least you don t have to worry about ice chip avalanche when you re going for the last drop of your bev the nfifth company a ginger brew raspberry bergamot essence mt gay eclipse rum off the cuff i wa unimpressed for maybe oz of cocktail that s steep even for boston standard but sipped over the course of the evening i found it to be a pleasant surprise of a beverage sweet tangy zippy sip totally worth it n nfull from the goat i almost passed up on dessert thank goodness my dining partner talked me out of that mistake we ordered the jamaican puddin pie no g with rum infused whipped cream it wa a small sliver of a slice but the custard like pie wa sweet and filling can i take a tub of that whip to go all in all a great dinner albeit a pricey one about for two with an excellent cocktail the lounge space is large enough to prevent crowding yet small enough to create that warm intimate feel that warms you right up a great choice for a private party or a relaxed semi casual first date if you can find the place order up the mollasses fried lollipop chicken lolly and let me know how they are great place amazing cocktail good food and nice atmosphere my fiance had the goat which wa awesome i ordered the lobster which wa a little disappointing small portion and a tad fishy but overall definitely a place worth checking out if you re in the phoenix area what a great little find this place is amazing so many different selection for rum the bartender were really great and friendly they explained the technique behind some of the popular drink and how they made a lot of their own tincture for drink they have an outdoor patio in the back for smoking cigar which i think that is pretty great we didn t try the food while we were there but they just rolled out with their new menu for summer i will be back the breadfruit is a caribbean themed restaurant in downtown phoenix that one of the member of our group recommended u to check out since they had been here before n nit is a chill spot and very cool looking inside they also have a cool back patio that you can hang out in a well i loved the look and feel of this place but personally i am not a fan of super spicy hot tasting food so i only ate several of them scallop the diver scallop themselves were cooked perfectly but my mouth wa literally en fuego it seems like nearly all the food item here were hot spicy so this restaurant lounge wa just not a good fit for me i didn t try the jerk chicken but the girl in the group complained it wa dry but a few of the guy seemed to enjoy it n nthe staff here wa awesome though our server rocked the house and made sure we were well taken care of they do offer quite unique cocktail and they try to incorporate rum spiced into many of their drink so i tried a mojito to play it safe and it wa good n nif you like spicy hot tasting caribbean food drink this may be your spot unfortunately i do not so i probably will not be back the food drink were reasonably priced because most of them cocktail and food consisted of high quality ingredient went to breadfruit a few week ago and it wa delicious they have a few vegetarian option that are quite good i ll need to return to update this review but believe me please you will like this small ish restaurant with big food goodness the staff is extremely friendly and helpful and you will not be disappointed will update soon excellent establishment the breadfruit rum bar is a very unexpected gem for the phoenix area i truly didn t expect much of a caribbean restaurant in the area the restaurant offer a great sampling of high end jamaican dining along with a rum selection that is unique eclectic and satisfying the staff wa extremely attentive perfectly told the story of the establishment s focus and provided both drink and food that were exquisite highly recommended this is my very favorite little spot in phoenix my first visit the daily rum punch wa blood orange passion fruit and rum infused with baby grapefruit leaf are you kidding it wa awesome and just a small example of the up and beyond level of passion invested in everything they do true the daily punch and the seared scallop with rum reduction hot buttered rum and plantain are simply must have and regardless of your other selection you will find yourself saying omg to everything you put into your mouth breadfruit is a little jewel and exactly that hole in the wall kind of place with incredible food we search high and low for enjoy decent food flavor were good for phx but if you are looking to relive and experience you had in jamaica you are not going to find it here good execution lack of the really bold jerk flavor that you come to love while in jamaica would i come back maybe absolutely wonderful early evening meal with wonderful service carrot juice wa perfect compliment to the meal festival wa perfect had the brown stew chicken and the flavor were just right spicy shared the slaw and all of the flavor so complimented each other the rice wa generous and tasty and did not sit heavy at the end of the meal the ginger sweet potato pudding wa wonderful no heavy sugar taste just plain comfort food the entire meal wa like sitting down at the table of the chef s family i will definitely return get the rum flight everything after that won t matter very quaint romantic spot with great locally sourced food have a good cigar selection highly recommended in phoenix for a few night and checked this place out started with a drink that wa recommended by the server i believe the name of it had the word punch in it would definitely recommend it if you are looking for something that is not too sweet atmosphere is great for a date night but considering we had an infant with u i would leave the kiddy at home i know that may be common sense but since we are out of towner our little one had to come tried the avocado and plantain appetizer which wa very unique who would think to add these two item together brilliant my husband tried the jerk pulled pork and if you like food with a kick i would try something different and give this a try a it will give you a kick ended my meal with a butter drink of some sort which wa dessert in liquid form a creamy liqueur drink but well work it left off the sweet potato pudding dessert which also wa unique and quite delicious all these item were recommended by the server so a for the recommendation and listening to my like in order to find the perfect match from the menu great date night restaurant and i would recommend sitting outside on a nice warm evening breadfruit is in a small non descript building a block from asu downtown if you weren t heading in that direction with the specific intention of going to breadfruit you d never know it existed n nit s a tiny place probably seating at the absolute max so i see how it could get packed with a quick influx of people on this particular lunch outing around the noon hour i wa one of five diner and still it took nearly minute to get my food so don t expect a quick lunch in between business meeting this place is too laid back for that but the service wa tremendously friendly n ni got the jerk chicken and it wa very well spiced thankfully not overpowering like i ve had elsewhere it wa a nice hefty sized chicken breast and wa very succulent not dry at all like others have suggested perhaps other reviewer aren t familiar with traditional dry rub jerk i do wish there wa more chutney though a it wa delicious the corn pineapple and slaw were all a bit flavorless n nthe highlight of the meal by far wa the carrot juice which wa like drinking a big slice of frosted carrot cake and offset the spicy jerk chicken nicely n ni m sure i ll go again at some point to try some of the other item but i m not into it a a lunch place even though it s close to where i work i can get a quicker and just a filling lunch elsewhere for cheaper not that a jerk chicken entree and carrot juice is that expensive i haven t had many experience in jamaican dining but if this is what it always taste like then i think i m adding jamaican cuisine to my list of like nestled on a side street in downtown phoenix the breadfruit could just a easily be nestled in a corner of a beach village just waiting for diner to experience an intimate meal the vibe here is definitely like that of a beach town everything is calm cool and collected the dining room is tiny and if you plan on coming with more than just one person i definitely suggest calling ahead it s cozy with dim lighting and perfect for a date night n nmoving on to the food those who can t handle a kick of spice to their cuisine should be warned the menu doesn t lie when it say that the food is spicy but if you can handle a major kick the food is worth it to start i tried the mussel i m not typically a mussel fan but these were an exception they had a jamaican kick to them and the serving were generous in size for my meal i had the jerk shrimp and holy moly did they have a jerk of spice to them the shrimp came with pineapple and this long piece of plantain type bread and i ordered a side of rice the meal wa delicious n nnow be warned the pricing here isn t cheap however i am not letting that take away from the fact that the food wa delicious the atmosphere wa wonderful and the cocktail made of fresh fruit and delicious rum were supreme i will definitely come back and this time i ll take a cab so i can continue my post dinner cocktailing at rumbar next door came for a rum cocktail and wa not disappointed i like to try new flavor so ordered the alchemist with sage saffron myrhh tincture n bayleaf mmmm sat at the bar and it wa such a treat to watch our bartender craft these exotic cocktail one after the other however i can only speak for the drink a i didn t try the food first time at this place following a recommendation interesting vibe at this place little uptight for me we were the first in the door at we were asked about our reservation yes we had one we were asked to sit in the waiting area what you just opened then we were asked by the next person if we had a reservation finally we made it to the table we were the only one there strange greeting obviously being a rum bar drink option were very limited interestingly enough no iced tea option i don t think i have ever been to a restaurant that doesn t have tea the sollera wa quite tasty but not quite the same a tea apps were really good scallop and plantain would do both of these again they will not alter or substitute any of the menu option tread lightly if you have food allergy entree were also quite good pork belly wa fantastic pork with polenta wa also good spicy could not get dessert a both option had dairy and gluten overall food wa very good the environment and service approach is a bit stuffy for my taste i would have thought the vibe at a jamaican restaurant would be a bit more easy going and friendly not the way it is here it s been awhile since i ve been to the breadfruit and i d heard about their new bar next door so my girlfriend and i gave this place a whirl after dinner down the street really nice little neighborhood bar not a big space mind you a there is bar seating and a few small couch but a nice intimate setting with cool lighting exposed red brick and a nice color and lighting scheme to setup a very laid back atmosphere and there s plenty of overflow space into the breadfruit next door they just updated their drink menu so the waiter wasn t completely up to speed on the latest menu item but we took a shot at couple of the old school favorite among them is the punch bowl special which is not surprisingly a punch bowl the bartender mix in with different rum on a nightly basis good stuff we also got a mr smith and a tamarind ball some of their drink are a little on the pricey side but we weren t disappointed with any of them note if you re super ambitious they have a drink on the menu that retail for per pour we had a great view of the bar and the multitude of rum and other unique alcoholic concoction on the wall and felt perfectly at home with the friendly staff great addition to the neighborhood and topped off the night perfectly appetizer overpriced small portion nentrees good flavor nservice lacking n nthe server who had our table wa awkward she wa nice enough but didn t really understand service my friend asked for a cocktail twice and on the first occasion they said they couldnt make anything with grapefruit juice and on the second occasion he ordered a pina colada and specified a type of rum n nshe came back and said the bartender wouldnt make it because the flavor would comprimise the integrity of the flavor he wanted brazilian rum in a pina colada big deal just make the drink don t make him feel bad n nwe felt rushed a our plate were cleared before our friend were finished eating n nthe food wa tasty however i won t be back due to the strange vibe i got absolutely amazing food incredibly intimate atmosphere the music is low enough to hear your date it s incredibly quiet and dark perfect place for a date the menu is a little pricey so come ready to drop at least on a table of two if you have alcohol the rum selection is amazing they only have beer and a similarly abysmal wine list but it s a rum bar and they do rum better than any other place in phoenix the mojito is strong yet tasty and the sheer number of different cocktail is startling the wait staff is incredibly nice and knowledgeable about they re menu they have a catch of the day plate when i went it wa salmon and it wa probably the best salmon i ve ever had overall breadfruit is an absolutely perfect date night restaurant i will definitely be back first friday for july this place is packed think of a sardine can packed little room to walk around from bar to seat and no room to breathe a soon a breadfruit ha the money they need to expand the space good drink are a total loss in such a tiny space oh and you cannot take your drink outside and sit at the cafe table i do not think their liquor license allows that minus one star for the cramped space n nthe drink are fantastic they are strong flavorful bold drink your heart may skip a beat at the price the rum drink are all the beer is and the wine is glass but the drink is worth the money my one mojito vanilla made me intoxicated yes i am a light weight but i usually need drink to do the trick seriously five star drink n nthe mojitos are fan ta tic wonderful delicious the matuselum platino rum used in the mojitos is smooth and tasty the muddled mint is powerful but it doe not overpower the drink it is a perfect balance n nmy review should honestly be two line good strong delicious pricey drink that you should enjoy and tiny cramped space not good for large party or too many patron bleh i m sorry breadfruit but i will not be back i wa really excited to try this place when we heard it wa opening i ve said before that i don t like mexican spicy but i do like asian spicy i forgot to add that i also like caribbean spicy finally a place in downtown to get some good caribbean jamaican food boy wa i wrong n nwe met a couple friend here and when we walked in i loved the decor it look just like the inside of my house with the bright colored wall and the exposed brick and ductwork unfortunately my love for this place stop there we decided to order the plaintain avocado spring roll taste wise these were okay on the first bite the more you ate the le distinguishable the flavor got it wa really just a big mess of mush inside a soggy wonton type wrapper the dipping sauce wa tasty though n ni ordered the jerk shrimp and it came with a side of rice and bean the tail were removed from the shrimp which wa really nice to not have to take care of myself unfortunately the shrimp were not cooked very well they were quite tough and had this weird crispiness to them the flavor on the shrimp wa ridiculously overpowering i know i am a bit of a wimp when it come to heat and spice but this wa too much i couldn t taste anything besides the spice even after downing my entire bottle of pineapple soda which wa way too sugary everyone else s food looked decent but overcooked one dish the stew looked like baby diarrhea honestly the highlight of the meal wa the little breadstick thing they serve alongside the food it wa pretty good n nsorry breadfruit i will continue to pas by you in favor of better restaurant like the turf i went to lunch at the breadfruit it wa around pm when my lunch date and i entered the tiny but warm restaurant we had the place to ourselves our waitress wa great right away she explained the menu and sold u on a couple of mocktails i had the carrot juice and my date had the kiwi pineapple quencha the carrot juice had coconut milk nutmeg and vanilla mixed in it wa tasty i love anything with coconut milk even carrot juice my guest s drink had kiwi and pineapple nectar and wa garnished with a piece of sugar cane my guest gnawed on the sugar cane to give it a whirl she liked her drink too n nwe split a house tropical salad to start the green and veggie were very crisp and the fruit wa juicy the ginger poppy seed vinaigrette wa refreshing and i couldn t place the zing to the dressing i asked our waitress and she informed me it wa the orange zest i wa tasting of course n ni ordered the jerk chicken and my guest ordered the coconut curried tofu the chicken wa wonderfully spiced the coleslaw wa not wet which i liked much more healthier the roasted corn had a hint of something else maybe coconut the corn just had a nice flavor i haven t enjoyed corn on the cob that much in a long time i saved the grilled pineapple for last and it wa worth the wait my date s tofu wa excellent it wa like tender piece of meat again with the coconut she let me have a taste yum n ni am glad i finally made it to the breadfruit i knew it wa there just never got around to it i am glad i went i will be back and i will add it to my lunch rotation i found this restaurant on vegan restaurant locator so i had expectation of many thing to select from a wa described on the site in reality there wa one entree on the menu or you could put together some side to keep it vegan it s a nice place but they probably shouldn t be listed on a vegetarian vegan friendly website the description there is misleading that being said the food wa excellent and the atmosphere charming it s a little upscale so we felt a bit uncomfortable in our t shirt and jean and the look on the host s face confirmed it if we go again we will dress a bit nicer and will know what to expect on the menu this restaurant is an absolute gem of the art district down town my husband and i rode the light rail with our bike in tow when we found breadfruit what an excellent choice craig our server wa fantastic and helped u pick out the perfect dinner and drink we ordered the fish of the day red snapper prepared with their custom seasoning and their house salad with a red strip and their signature jamaican mojito we were in food heaven and just when i thought it couldn t get any better we ordered a chocolate souffle and ice cream for dessert everything wa just perfect the fish wa the best we had ever had the drink were exceptional the atmosphere wa great for our date night and the service wa on par we loved our experience and highly recommend you check it out what a great place i love this place i absolutely love it great food great drink really cool vibe i am an az native and love eating down town this is the first place i think of when trying to come up with something fun and delicious that everyone will enjoy be prepared for some good spicy caribbean food excited about my first dining experience today at the breadfruit at e pierce st downtown phoenix learned about the establishment while researching suggested restaurant from my company vendor for a large group coming to town in march wa told at pm that there wa a two hour wait and that it s best to make a reservation before dining well of course i wa not going to wait two hour to eat dinner so we left then it hit me the white couple in front of u that arrived at the same time wasn t leaving nor did they have reservation why were they staying and we weren t so at pm i called the restaurant from my car to make a pm reservation the same person dwayne who said he wa the owner told me he could accommodate u at pm definitely not two hour maybe my voice didn t sound black like my face looked what a huge let down i will do my best to spread the word about my unfortunate experience at breadfruit breadfruit is a refreshing restaurant for anyone in search of delicious fresh and filling food i have tried numerous appetizer and each have been wonderful i particularly like the patty the flaky crust is perfect a for entree i love that they have some inventive and creative vegetarian and vegan option the curry tofu is my favorite however the pop cho is also tasty a for beverage the carrot juice or the coconut water are good but i am docking them a star a soon i will no longer be able to byob here hopefully when they get their liquor license they will have great wine so i can update my post everyone must finish their meal with the breadfruit s own homeade vanilla ice cream and sweet potato pudding it is melt in your mouth good if they sold the vanilla ice cream in pint i would stock it in my freezer and probably turn into a vanilla ice cream addict breadfruit is simply wonderful while shopping at the farmer s market downtown one saturday someone handed u a little square sample of something so delicious we went back for another bite it wa the sweet potato bread pudding served at breadfruit and knew this wa a restaurant we had to try nwe went for dinner on a weeknight and were immediately greeted by a friendly and knowledgeable server the restaurant is inviting and cozy lit with candle and open kitchen polished concrete floor a brick wall and bright green accent nthe waiter who wa attentive without hovering recommended an appetizer on special that night and it wa fantastic it had heat but it wa the flavor that came through we ordered rice to go with at the server s recommendation and were glad we did a it gave something to soak up that leftover sauce fantastic my husband order another special for his entree oxtail rice and chard it wa delicious but the hit of the night wa a staple entree jerk chicken again plenty of heat but the flavor were doing a reggae in my mouth we ended our meal with rich coffee made in the french press and the dessert that had lured u there in the first place sweet potato bread pudding the menu isn t extensive but what we had wa exquisitely prepared and the special added variety it s also vegetarian friendly we will definitely be back i go back and forth on this place sometimes it great sometimes i feel it over done and not really worth it n nsomeone marked that it wasn t ahmazing and i tend to agree but in a city that ha far too many pizza and burger and southwest place it nice to have a change of pace the food is well priced n nit not my go to but i enjoy it and i d highly recommend going if you want something different and never been one of my favorite place to get drink they have a different daily punch and some really inventive rum cocktail not what you expect appetizer overpriced small portion nentrees good flavor nservice lacking n nthe server who had our table wa awkward she wa nice enough but didn t really understand service my friend asked for a cocktail twice and on the first occasion they said they couldnt make anything with grapefruit juice and on the second occasion he ordered a pina colada and specified a type of rum n nshe came back and said the bartender wouldnt make it because the flavor would comprimise the integrity of the flavor he wanted brazilian rum in a pina colada big deal just make the drink don t make him feel bad n nwe felt rushed a our plate were cleared before our friend were finished eating n nthe food wa tasty however i won t be back due to the strange vibe i got it ha been a while since we ve tried somewhere new in downtown in all honesty it is difficult to try new place when all of the new place are only open for lunch and i don t get home until pm that is why we were pleased to see a new place right down the street opening up and actually staying open until n nthe breadfruit is the work of dwayne allen a far a i can tell he is a nobody in the restaurant scene which is a nice change of pace for some of the place that are going in downtown the space is quite inviting small open lofty area for dining with seating for about people inside bright green wall and faux brick interior brightened the area up and contrasted the exposed duct i felt like i wa at home there were two table set up outside a well providing an inviting option in the cooler month but the local foot traffic wa a little sketch n nthe menu is different there are word that you recognize surrounded by word that you don t making ordering a bit difficult most likely you will go with the word you know and order based on that my party seemed to have done just that n nafter a lengthy wait to place and receive our order our table wa full of food n nplantain avocado spring roll with seasonal chutney this overpriced appetizer wa a terrible mess of mushy vegetable warmed inside a pastry and layered with mashed mandarin orange the group enjoyed i wa le than impressed and greatly disgusted at the contrast of hot and cold on the plate n nescovitch fish and festival friend got this she seemed to enjoy it not finding it to be nearly a spicy a it wa made out to seem the fish seemed like it wa cooked well and the escovitch sause wa excellent n nbrown stew chicken friend got this he seemed to find it to be skimpy compared to some of the other dish the meat wa significantly le existent there were also some bone in the chicken n njerk shrimp wife got this she thought it wa good but wa suffering from the spice she is not one to eat spicy food and this wa too hot for her the shrimp were cooked well and had a bit of crisp to them also the tail were removed which earned them big bonus point in my book n njerk chicken off the grill mine if ever a dam break and flood downtown phoenix i know that we will be safe the chicken at zoe s cafe and the breadfruit will save our home by absorbing the water i couldn t imagine drier chicken than at zoe s before last night but the jerk flavoring added to the bone dry chicken wa the perfect storm to absorb any liquid from my body terrible simply terrible realizing that the chicken wasn t spicy at all by my standard i ordered up some more of that escovitch sauce and drenched by chicken in it whereby making it palatable the chicken wa surrounded by an over cooked pineapple slice that wa hard and dry a tiny piece of corn that had such small kernel on it that i actually had to use a knife to cut them off something i hate there wa also a pile of ital coleslaw which wa a combination of stick and rubbish that traditionally make it into the bin at most restaurant hard time call for desperate measure n ndrinks did include a wonderful selection of jamaican soda the ginger beer wa great but very sugary my wife tell me that the pineapple soda wa a little strong and could have been a bit subdued she also complained of the sugaryness of the soda n nin all breadfruit is a welcome addition to the downtown neighborhood i wa not surrounded by dirty hippy with dreadlock and the owner were good people i would recommend that people try it once but i would never suggest it a a place to go for dinner n nalso keep in mind that the owner will harass you if you leave even slightly negative review of his place on yelp breadfruit is the truth n nthis is corroborated by the fact that exhibit a i e the jerk chicken will make you a believer in a deity be it god buddha allah brahman akal purakh zeus or marley n nthe bird is marinated in hot and spicy seasoning and finished to perfection on the grill it remained tender and juicy throughout except for the masterfully charred end that added a slight smokiness to the entire dish n nbut let back up a second n nthe space itself is brilliant in it simplicity the wall are lime and slate gray with classy darkwood furniture the glassed wall look out onto the stoic skyline of downtown phoenix and onto the hidden pave of pierce an homage to side street gem that one would find in city like ny sf and seattle n nit is comfortable and cozy inside with exposure to the cuisine shark tending the kitchen at all time there is activity but just enough so that you feel the life of the kitchen spill out onto the dining area i love restaurant that pull this off n nfor an app we started with an order of the curry chicken patty it wa sensational within the pastry wa a harmonious balance of chicken to curry with a noticeable but slight burn throughout two came in an order which must be shared with a partner because two pre meal would fill you up too heavily n nwhen the grilled jerk chicken wa presented it wa glorious because you find the caribbean influence presented on the dish a white wine vinegar drizzled slaw roasted pineapple and a succulent savory corncob where the chicken is the heart of the meal the corn wa the soul paired together i couldn t have been more delighted n nto drink we had the d g spicy ginger beer imported from jamaica erm i typically like ginger beer but this one wa branded a spicy and they f ing mean it be careful that you are prepared for spice on spice if you order it looking back i probably should have stuck with water although the ginger beer wa rudimentary for palate preservation a you meander through all of the various flavor of this cuisine honestly i cannot wait to go here to grab a guinness a jamaican staple according to zane lamprey or a red stripe the surging spiciness demand a brew that could handle this oral development n noverall i m very pleased breadfruit braved the great menace that is downtown development here s to them gaining credibility a they continue to master their art it not perfect yet but please believe it in the mail and invigorate a local following of foodie and tourist alike to sample some mean caribbean food i wa visiting phoenix for a conference and this wa a particularly surprising and delicious find ncocktails i don t love rum but all the drink have rum in them we tried the run lunch change daily fin co and a rum old fashion all were amazing well balanced and smooth nfood we shared a pepper shrimp appetizer which had some heat but wa really delicious and he shrimp were cooked perfectly i got the red stripe curried prawn and my friend got the jerked chicken both were delicious a were the side but i have to say the curried prawn were surprisingly great the curry definitely tasted of red stripe but the mix of spice paired so well and i want to go back to phoenix just for this i sent several other friend to breadfruit for dinner and they were equally impressed and raved about the food and drink nthe service atmosphere cleanliness and restrains were all great too our food came out hot drink were promptly delivered it s a bit snug in the restaurant but that s really the only thing that isn t glowing that i have to say about it and to be honest i didn t even notice it that much because i wa so impressed with the food and drink highly recommend every meal should start with grace and we did what a delightful server and what a delightful place nice ambiance in and out and what an amazing array of rum the girl in our group enjoyed the rum punch of the day while the guy sipped on their jamaican beer our smoked marlin appetizer wa a great start tho the amount of toasted bread could have been increased it could have been if we paid extra we all scarfed down our entree while my catch of the day wa gone in no time i wa able to taste my husband red stripe prawn which may be my next choice on our next trip which there will be i do love rum and should review the rum bar separately but both the rum bar and the breadfruit restaurant are equally awesome n ngreat recommendation from the waiter brown stew chicken and jerk chicken are really good really spicy on the jerk chicken but thats somewhat expected and perfect for me i ll take my plantain baked over fried any day so good really great place to go for not so typical food n nthe entire place is quite small in a perfect intimate way their seems to be a lot of pride in the menu environment and service which is rare to see in restaurant employee not to mention a perfect location very walkable to other nearby bar and easy to make a whole night of downtown phoenix went last night after hearing rave review everything wa spectacular our server christian knew it wa our anniversary and took great care of u the food wa incredible and the cocktail were top notch the place is beautiful cozy and intimate for a moment i felt like i wa not in phoenix which i wa grateful for if i were being totally honest i would give this place a star review but my dining companion thought her food wa pretty good so i bumped it up a star for her i went here with a friend last night after the yelp event at pb it wa very close by and also close to my the place i m moving into in a couple of week so i thought it would be a nice opportunity to give it a try we went in had no wait it wa like pm or so and were seated in the tiny dining room the menu had some interesting looking item on it the drink menu looked good too but being that i had been drinking all night at the yelp event i figured i didn t need to pay for a drink i asked the waitress what soup they had and she said they didn t have soup that day and in a tone that wa like you idiot i think because the soup say saturday soup or something but i figured if it wa on the regular everyday menu and not a special menu it wa probably just a name for the soup maybe it wa stupid i don t know so i asked for my second choice the chicken and dumpling oh sorry we re out of that ohhhhhhk so i asked what she would get and she went on and on about the prawn i told her i wasn t into seafood so what did she suggest that wa not seafood and she replied have you ever had prawn really not the expected response from a waitress i have had prawn i do not like them or most any seafood and i do not want an inflated check for food that i do not want because your restaurant is out of everything else she then suggested the salad with chicken in it so i got that my friend got the chicken sandwich she said the sandwich wa good my salad wa terrible we both concurred it wa one of the worst salad i have had the dressing tasted like orange rind and wa super sweet and the chicken in it wa very spicy which i like but the two flavor together were not complimentary also the salad wa drenched in that dressing no eating around it the veggie seemed fresh enough and it looked nice but for it is absolutely not worth it i got a to go box and left it by the light rail so a homeless person could try to eat it although i think they may even leave it behind i m not sure i would come back here hard to judge a restaurant off of one salad but i m leaning toward a no on that one n np my friend said they have really cute bathroom so that s a plus my wife and i went there several month ago before they opened the rum bar next door and brought our own wine not sure if they offer byob anymore but the food wa delicious and had a nice kick this is not a watered down version of jerk offering if you like heat and a great relaxed atmosphere you will like breadfruit the jerk shrimp wa quite good the lack of depth to the menu is the only down side n nmatt c i wa a bit underwhelmed by my experience n ni will start with the good ni wa definitely a fan of their drink they had a wide variety of drink and their menu wa organized so everyone could find something they d like i had the velvet and vinyl which i thought wa flavorful and light while others described it a perfume n ni tried their take on an old fashion rum old fashion and they did a great job with that a well i would highly recommend this place if you re just looking for a drink n nthe atmosphere is definitely jamaican but i thought it wa way too loud for what seemed like it could be an intimate dining experience n nour server wa very friendly but she spilled one of our beverage on the walk over and it took an exceptionally long time to get a replacement i understand spillage a i am a clumsy fool but the remake should have been much quicker n nwe ordered the scallop to start they were delicious but there were two of them definitely don t just order these if you re hungry they had a slight kick n nthe shrimp i literally felt like i had licked hell eating this dish we ended up ordering a side of rice to go along with it so if you re interested in trying this meal which wa delicious after you got passed the spice you need to order some rice to soak up the spice n noverall it wa a cool spot but it to feel a little more jamaican inside and offer a bit more to their food menu tried for lunch on a tuesday with six we got great service from jason and thought the food wa great too jerk chicken and the tofu were spicy and flavorful we would visit again this restaurant came highly recommended however customer service need much improvement the food wa really tasty but the service wa le than desirable our server made a point of letting u know that there would be a gratuity added since we were a party larger than that there wa no splitting of check seriously with all of modern technology what is the big deal in splitting the check it s a shame because the food wa really good but we will not be coming back due to the poor customer service significant other and i went here back on oct th we had heard great thing about this place from friend we trust so we decided to check it out a we were told it is a very quaint place and could lead to wait time to be seated if you go during a busy time luckily we beat the crowd and were able to sit right away the place ha a dark cool ambience but look clean and inviting ni had the sorrell drink it wa really good but a bit too strong of a taste for me to go with my dinner we had the plantain avocado spring roll for an appetizer they were good but a little mushy and not quite a flavorful a i had expected the jerk chicken off the grill wa delicious it wa one of the most flavorful juiciest tender chicken dinner i ve had and the side of corn rice and pineapple were perfect nof course i had to try a desert the pudd n a la mode very nice nall in all a great local small business to try out and you ll find that you will probably return when i lived downtown rum bar wa my weekly sometimes bi or tri weekly indulgence rum bar is the perfect date spot cozy and romantic with a fantastic reggae soundtrack playing drink are strong and oh so good my favorite drink are the pina colada trust me on this one no syrup involved and mojito but i ve definitely sampled most the bar menu if you are a rum connoisseur which i m not the bar is lined with what could easily be bottle of rum nthis is by far my favorite bar in phoenix i love it so much i came for new year nparting word go to rum bar enjoy the patio meditate to some music order some appetizer from breadfruit and kick back with your rum beverage of choice the portion were small cooked scallop were cold jerked chicken salad barely had any chicken in it large plate were brought with tiny serving food wa tasty enough but insultingly small portion my bill wa high relative to what i received wouldn t go back food wa crazy good service wa very good too i like the aesthetic a well it is expensive so i wouldn t frequent it too much but i m only in az for the week anyway the breadfruit balance chic dining with sensible everyman price and simple authentic presentation n nsome dish are very spicy seasoned w habanero so avoid these if you re adverse to hot spicy n nrum sangria wa brilliantly mixed and coffee bean add an extra level to the aroma even still i wa left wondering if putting rum in sangria wa really necessary the breadfruit s mixed drink are for people with a particular affinity for rum otherwise do not try them the season pear rum cocktail wa way too rum y the ingredient did not pair well i thought n nsea scallop appetizer scallop cooked just right great dish but the pricing doesn t fit my comment above n noverall i applaud the breadfruit for being unique yet unpretentious in a manner true to jamaica n ndinner saturday pm the two of u share two cocktail seasonal pair and rum sangria the sea scallop appetizer and entree jerk chicken off the grille and curried chicken w dumpling mmmm festival i wish i could have those sweet breadstick for breakfast everyday i ve been to breadfruit a handful of time now and evry experience ha been positive the waitstaff ha been attentive friendly and accommodating the food appeared in a reasonable amount of time and wa always tasty i m not a huge fan of soya chunk so i usually end up ordering a bunch of side and appetizer and dessert which suit me just fine i would also recommend the blue mountain coffee in an individual french press it s so very delicious n n btw on first friday in march also art detour my friend and i were able to get a table after waiting maybe ten minute once seated the service wa prompt and friendly and our food wa great enjoyed the bar area and the drink the food wa good however i wa disappointed in the portion size also i thought there wa a limited variety in the menu the strongest statement about the breadfruit can be made be it owner chef he doesn t have any restaurant experience he s just making the traditional jamaican recipe of his grandmother n nand it work n ni took my two vegan friend to the breadfruit on a weeknight and the small restaurant wa about half full there are two ikea table with chair in the grass in front of the restaurant for al fresco dining n na we waited for the delicious avocado and plantain spring roll we had plenty to talk about with our drink order hibiscus infused tea and the carrot juice pricing seems steep but in all fairness these were beverage worth every penny the breadfruit is byob wine six pack or beer bottle corkage fee but i had forgotten this drunken little detail n nwe asked if there were more vegan option than the two clearly marked entree and he confirmed that most of the starter side were vegan too warning the spinach patty contains beef broth in the crust our server returned from the kitchen to let u know n nwe decided to share everything n nthe tofu curry is a nice complete meal served with rice pea bean steamed cabbage and bell pepper and a side of baked plantain the breadfruit ha also added a new item pop cho and pickled ginger a sautee of bok choy onion and rice wine vinegar which is served with a memorable jamaican sweet potato mash n nthe side of grilled corn wa juicy and sweet with no dead kernel n nthe festival is not your everyday bread stick and the subtle sweetness had u wondering if vanilla is the only sweetening agent n nduring the meal we all noted the teeny tiny sink in the more than ample bathroom the primary color wall are juxtaposed nicely against exposed brick and the kitchen is open and you can see the duo chef preparing the food the service wa prompt and courteous n nfor dessert we shared the delectable sweet potato pudd n which is acompact wedge of sweet potato ginger nutmeg and raisin baked with coconut flake on top perhaps it s a bit dry for some taste but we found it most enough and we battled with fork for the last bite n nat this point one of the chef came out and asked with a bright warm smile if we were the vegan table she herself she said wa a vegan she mentioned that the sweet potato pudd n wa the giveaway the breadfruit had at the recent west of western culinary festival held at the phoenix art museum n nher visit wa like a second dessert it s always so nice to so the excitement of the chef who ha just prepared your food n nthe breadfruit is a strong addition to the downtown culinary scene now bustling on that corner of st and pierce with pastabar sen and the turf accountant i rarely go for jamaican a there are usually no vegan option except pea rice i wa lucky enough to find this place via yelp when i wa traveling for biz in phx n nhad an awesome lunch the menu clearly mark vegan option the tropical salad had a lovely tart dressing the fresh pineapple wa a nice touch the sorrel drink wa gingery hibiscus goodness but my entree took the cake an amazing coconut curried tofu it actually wa seitan not tofu whatevs n nsimple modern ambiance super friendly attentive waitstaff n nwill definitely go back if i make it to phoenix again we arrived at pm on a friday and asked to sit outside since it wa a beautiful night and we would have had to wait a while for inside seating our server wa friendly but a little pushy and managed i know it s our fault to up sell everything it s a byob place so we brought beer but couldn t drink it since we were outside so we all ordered a fruit drink including a whole coconut for it s water then fruit nthe appetizer were really small for the price and although the mango avocado spring roll sound delicious they weren t that tasty i ordered the coconut curry tofu which wa great and not spicy the jerk chicken wa too spicy for me nour dinner for four came to before tip pretty pricy since we didn t have alcohol we ve been here a few time for dinner never disappointed the last time we went with a party of on a first friday they allowed u to scatter ourselves until an top could be constructed n none of our party wa a newcomer to the valley from harlem who wa a cruise organizer to jamaica an aficionado in other word he came away impressed with the authenticity and variety rum bar and it s adjacent restaurant the breadfruit is awesome just spectacular jamaican food the scallop were delectable the jerk chicken wa delightfully spicy and the cocktail were fantastic service wa great too i recommend sitting at the bar you might luck into some free rum tasting like we did let start with the nay sayers that have placed some review on here i am not sure what you saw read or thought you would experience here but i am very confused by them first the caribbean is known for a great many spice and throughout history they have traded them looted for them and perfected them so when you say the jerk chicken lit your mouth on fire i say you re welcome each item we ordered wa perfectly seasoned and so well done if it wasn t for the urban atmosphere i would have said i wa eating in jamaica we ordered the plantain to start which were amazing it is hard to perfect a plantain in my opinion since they can be bland but these are very tasty the jerk sauce paired with it wa amazing and that wa just the starter we ordered the prawn and the caribbean jerk salad and the red stripe curried prawn again how do you make a dish from very humble ingredient taste so good first you come here you let the chef magic happen the prawn were spicy and full of flavor the red bean and rice are an awesome compliment top notch food n nnow the bar okay this is a bar not a beer night followed by shot of some swill this is a bar people there are mixologist that can place taste on your palate from very precise mix of rum and flavor up on the shelf this is not a vodka bar a one review had so complained it is a rum bar and it doe just that amazingly they pull the flavor and complexity of each rum and pour it into a drink of amazing conception that very few bar do anymore very well done n nmy only negative wa that i wished that it wa bigger well but then i don t people need to experience this all on their own being that it is a smaller footprint you will need a reservation it did feel cramped in the corner but it did not detract from the experience for me walking up and in might be a challenge but don t let that stop you from going in amazing great drink and food i really like the jerk chicken and the spanish gentleman cocktail but know that the chicken is very hot having read many of the review that referenced service issue we must have been in a different restaurant we arrived about minute early and were greeted by the host he asked u to have a seat while he checked to see if our table wa ready we were taken to our table another minute and christian one of the best server i ever had helped u select our drink after describing how the the menu wa written and several of the drink unique ingredient we had the plantain and mango chutney for an appetizer the red snapper in banana leaf and jet pork for entree christian made excellent drink suggestion to pair with the entree she regularly checked with u within just a few minute of each item arriving what made her so special wa her knowledge and genuine enthusiasm for the menu item you could tell she really enjoyed her job we finished the evening with the rum cake and a perfect cup of coffee we cannot wait to go back i really enjoyed breadfruit i had a mixed drink called mule something with ginger beer in it and it wa great the dining area is small only table and is relaxing without a crowded feel i felt like i wa in a jamaican house and the food wa being prepared by the mom down the street this is not real jamaican food made reservation for pm had to wait for pm on the dot to get a table informed owner it wa my husband s bday celebration no acknowledgement what so ever drink are okay not worth the check i recommend to go back to the island and do some tasting don t spend your money here so delicious we had the jerk chicken and the shrimp salad it wa delightful the drink are amazing too great atmosphere i have tried rum in the past wasn t impressed tonight i had an amazing experience at thebreadfruit with my hubby the drink and food were memorable and beyond flavorful so amazingly good i ate very slow to savor every bite wellbeback cheap fresh flavorful nthat s the important stuff n ni love trying new thing and breadfruit did not disappoint i wa a big fan of the jerk chicken grilled plantain and fruity juice n npros small cute setting byob plate every dish had a couple of side that came with n ncons street parking service can be a bit slow cute lil spot downtown phx we sat on the patio the waiter wa very good and knowledgeable abt every thing on the menu everything he suggested he sold u on the cocktail were top notch we shared apps spicy shrimp and plantain delicious jerk chicken wa awesome only thing i wish they had were oxtail that woulda put this place at star further reinforcing my negative review i just received a message from this business that consisted of a one word name calling insult what better method to ensure that i will go out of my way to continue to warn people away from this poorly managed dump good job we ate here last night before a show at crescent ballroom we arrived a bit before pm and were a party of we weren t the largest party there and definitely got there before a couple of the larger party n nwe didn t get our food until a quarter after after watching the larger party that were seated after u receive thiers i asked our server to bring u some to go box when she brought the food out a well a the check a we didn t want to miss the show we planned to watch and we didn t receive it for another minute i m tempted to say that our server didn t place our order immediately or wa too occupied with the trainee that wa following her around to notice that we were in a hurry even after i asked for the check n nthe food wasn t bad but will likely never eat here again and just spend time at the rum bar the best restaurant in phoenix one of the best restaurant in the country the food cocktail and ambiance is unparalleled do not miss this place is tucked away off the main street very near sen which wa our destination but this looked tasty and there wa no wait so we ventured in n nthe food wa decent nothing special in my opinion but not terrible either nthe place is small and cozy with a different vibe n ni had the plantain avocado spring roll which were way better than my entree but perhaps i didn t order wisely and get the best entree ni had the curried chicken and dumpling and i wouldn t recommend it i wasn t too crazy about the sauce the banana and plantain were the best part of the dish nthe whole wheat dumpling served with my dish wa disgusting i couldn t take more than one bite and left it sit on the plate noverall it s not bad for the price but not great enough to make me ever want to return wanted to love this place had a reservation that we showed up on tome for but still waited minute to be seated the overall space wa cramped and our server wa attentive and informative there were many selection for drink and the two we chose were good food looked the part but wa under seasoned and quality portion size wa out done by price le of a date spot or dinner spot and more of a place to grab a good cocktail on the way to somewhere else probably even a good neighborhood spot but not a much of a destination dining experience a i had hoped been here a couple of time the cocktail apps we ve tried have never disappointed the ambiance is on the romantic side with pleasant lighting music i really enjoyed the scallop i have to say they are the best i ve had in town these are sweet cooked to perfection pillow of grandeur i am all about sharing apps entree in an effort to eat try more thing without out busting out at the seam however here i told my hub that next time we re pigging out each getting those or at the very least i m getting my own not sharing make a reservation bring some dough the staff is pleasant helpful too give it a go you won t be sorry amazing cocktail program you can tell they have been doing if for a long time not just because it s now a trend food wa awesome and very intensely seasoned cute ambiance really felt like i wa out of phoenix the whole experience made me feel like i wa in the caribbean i ended up here on a saturday afternoon because the place we were going for lunch wa a long wait and walking back to the car we saw the sign which worked out perfectly n ni had never been to a place like this before and the server wa super helpful with suggestion i had the avocado salad and it wa amazing and really fresh for dessert we shared the sweet potato pudd n with vanilla ice cream at the server suggestion and it wa absolutely delicious i now find myself craving it from time to time n ni liked the atmosphere a there is a small dining area perfect for a party of two there is a very jamaican feel to the decor and it complimented the menu nicely i definitely intend to go back and try out some other section from the menu and get some more of that pudd n the first thing you need to do when you walk into rumbar and breadfruit is to find brian the bartender who i think is the best bartender in phoenix n nthe shorty drink that they offer is no doubt in my opinion the best drink in phoenix n nbrian is a master craftsman when it come to truly craft made cocktail n nthe food is always excellent and the scallop should not be missed small plate and entree are exquisite yet spicy per the jamaican cuisine n nrumbar and breadfruit is no doubt one of my favorite place to enjoy both craft cocktail and excellent food enjoying it i live near the restaurant and have been time since it opened the jerk chicken is very spicy and extremely flavorful the curry chicken had a great taste but need caution while eating a not only are there bone but there are very small bone the avocado spring roll are great and the mango that come with them is kind of addicting the staff is friendly though never very attentive and once mischarged my credit card took day to get it cleared up they also list item on the menu that come with the entree but dont show up when you ask about that item they tell you there is an extra cost for it odd n n for being a unique option to phoenix and for being clean a a whistle we have been wanting to get here but tonight we made it first of all the atmosphere while a bit loud is made up for by the friendly and helpful the server craig so wa in heaven with the rum and scotch bonnet martini well there wa some other stuff in it but she always want something spicy in her drink lately and she got it my mojito wa great too jerk chicken wa so moist and while spicy wa not overly salty sweet potato pudd n with ice cream wa heavenly overall i will definitely be back for more breadfruit is one of the place that offer eccentric flair and cultural diversity in which phoenix lack at the moment the decor ha this cozy setting and i m a big fanatic of red brick wall wa content with the staff and they were courteous nthe food wa scrumptious i ordered the rice and pea that wa mixed up with coconut milk but however there wa a tiny piece of a habanero pepper and my mouth wa shooting flame which wa unexpected in my dish another dish wa the ital soup which is ideal for people who have a cold and a good cleanse after a good workout at the gym i saved the best for the last the vanilla ice cream combined with jello plump raisin and grape nut cereal had to savour every bite next time i will inform them not to put habanero pepper in my rice dish because that wa beyond too hot for me but i will be back to try their other dish great food and specialty drink enjoyed the jamaican jerk pork overall nice atmosphere great service unique hand crafted drink and delicious food i highly recommend giving it a try i have no idea why it took me so long to get to this place such a chill vibe with funky music to talk with a friend or significant other to for hour n nafter eating at sen around the corner which is fab btw my boyfriend took me to rum bar a he d been raving about their drink for quite some time the bar is separated from the restaurant by a small wall but both are quaint and cozy n nthe drink list hosted many unique offering we ordered a vanilla mojito and then our favorite a dark stormy ginger beer with gosling s rum oh my god the best mojito i have ever had a little on the sweet side but such a unique flavor with quality vanilla extract in it i can t wait to come back and try the food started off with drink of course our server wa good at providing recommendation on pairing our drink with meal choice my girlfriend had the pina colada warm and soothing while i had the shim sham light and refreshing meal my choice wa the curry prawn dish seasoning wa amazing my tongue wa doing the happy dance house special wa my girlfriend dinner choice of jerk chicken wow spicy with amazing flavor overall nice eclectic low key atmosphere with fabulous food and drink highly recommended i found this place on yelp and decided to check it out ni loved that they played island music and the drink were great server wa very nice and knowledgeable of the menu my fiance had the escovish fish which wa really good the place is small and intimate so go with someone you like okay so i decided to head to downtown again for the digital downtown contest this time i wa walking around the area at a m there s really something to say about watching a city wake up and walking about mile canvasing the street ultimately though i ve come to the realization that at best i take photo that could cut it a an amateur postcard but generally lack any artistic appeal n nbut something good came out of this breadfruit it wa one of the area in which i wa walking and stumbled upon literally i wasn t watching where i wa walking and doop there s the curb not uncommon for me being all matiche i peeked in the window because the music wa cranked up a i wa walking away a lady opened the door and let me know they opened for lunch at noon showed me the menu and suggested the jerk chicken since i d not had jamaican food before it s always delightful to find the owner jamming out outside of operating hour so rob m and i went for lunch n nwe started off with jamaican soda which were really sweet yet good i had the ginger beer and it s hellavalotta ginger it wa way strong rob had the cola champagne which wa like cream soda rob ordered the jerk chicken and i ordered the curried chicken and dumpling since the jerk chicken wa going to take minute we started out with a spicy beef pattie and a chicken curry pattie i started with half of the beef and it wa good spicy but the chicken wa amazing i could mack on those all day long our entree arrived and we dug in my dish wa very flavorful and the recommendation of the server wa to eat the dumpling with the sauce good idea since the dumpling itself doesn t have a very defined flavor and it particularly dense if you re thinking granny s chicken and dumpling this isn t it the jerk chicken wa so spicy that rob couldn t finish it he did find that eating it with a bite of pineapple helped to cut the heat but it wa still hades hot apparently if you order the carrot juice with this dish it counter the atomic heat seriously rob can handle spicy but this wa perhaps too much n noverall it wa a good experience there were a handful of other diner there at when we arrived and people were coming throughout our meal i m thinking this is probably authentic jamaican cooking and not an americanized version of it i would have liked more salt but i didn t ask because i wa in for the authenticity of the meal n nreally star but i ll bump it up because the setting is nice service wa good and it s in a cool neighborhood it s tucked into a residential area not too far from the new asu campus and i liked my meal this will be a place to which we ll return rum bar should be fun this one is not n nupside all the best run in the world ndownside poor bartender that only know and are allowed to make the recipe their owner teach them n nprices are way too high drink are way too weak n nthe california wine snob bar of rum ew discovered this place at the culinary event devoured i have been craving that fabulous grilled calamari but ala it is not on the current menu the calamari is theoretically going on the spring menu next week narrive at and am told that the restaurant open at at ish we return and discover that the happy hour pricing is only in the bar but they will make an exception for one drink each and an appetizer so we sit on the deck and enjoy that unbelievable rum punch and a plantain thing we spent a few week in jamaica last summer and never encountered punch that wonderful and trust me we tried many nour dish were equally great the guava glazed pork belly on a bed of bean mash wa divine the jerk pork and polenta wa spicy and bold and interesting and so very good i am dinging a star for the dingy server she is in another dimension perhaps the jamaican spliff effect nthis is jamaicain american not true hard core where is the calaloo we cant wait to go back we will sit in the lounge and drink rum punch until we are sated and then proceed to the deck for exceptional dining and hopefully the grilled calamari wow wow wow my hubby and i have been wanting to come to breadfruit for a while my hubby ha been to jamaica and all over the caribbean kiteboarding so he love the cuisine we decided to have early dinner since the sitter came earlier this saturday we didn t have a reservation but that wa no problem since we usually like to sit at the bar and talk to the bartender tony and beth were so nice and efficient tony just moved from portland in november so we had a nice conversation with him about the area we spend summer in or i had a mojito wow the best mojito i have had in the valley probably ever my hubby had the caipirinha it wa so good we thought we would have one appetizer and leave so we ordered the scallop then the plantain and avocado spring roll they were so delicious the scallop were spicy it wa like firework in my mouth in a good way i loved the sweetness of the chutney for my spring roll my hubby wanted the soup of the day the pumpkin and sweet potato soup i ended up eating most of it since i wa dd the hubby had another drink this time the kingston rum punch wow that wa strong but tasty tony recommended the rum glazed prawn and roti flatbread double wow my hubby had a pina colada to wash that down that wa the best pc i ve had not the blended coco lopez type for dessert we had their bread pudding this wa the only thing i wa not that crazy about don t get me wrong i still ate it i am just used to the new orleans type of bread pudding more gooey the experience at rum bar wa so great we can t wait to come back and bring friend this place is very cute great atmosphere and great staff the food wa also delicious my only thing wa that it wa kind of pricey i couldn t believe i paid over for two small appetizer but i guess that s why this place is doing so well n ni will definitely return again but won t be ordering the appetizer just going straight for their carrot coconut juice which wa amazing and their entree came with a bunch of colleague while we were in town for a conference the food wa delicious but the portion ran a touch small we ordered family style and had to order dish for woman the drink were amazing the staff were a bit snooty but otherwise helpful and timely finally great vegan food in downtown phoenix n nnot that i m a vegan but still n nthe owner here are really nice and will chat you up about your meal especially if you order something vegetarian the portion are smaller than most people will probably like but hey it s healthy and i ve never left not full just from ordering a plate n nthe menu is also somewhat limited but everything on it is tasty i say this with authority a a guilty omnivore who ha plucked food off of friend meat plate also the menu change a tiny bit from time to time n nif you go you must try the avocado plantain spring roll seriously if you like fresh locally grown with just the right mix of flavor here s another favorite of mine it just keep getting better each time i go this well respected establishment take pride and genuinely care about the food they are serving n n curried tofu n scallop n patty tilapia n brown stew chicken n carrot juice it s addicting n nthe breadfruit focus on caribbean dish in phoenix using locally grown fresh organic produce the restaurant itself is small but they ve expanded by adding a rum bar everything is freshly squeezed and they have the drink of the day for the after dinner cigar smoker there is a cigar bar where you can enjoy your cocktail and smoke your cigar n nthe owner s of this establishment are very friendly and it s almost a if you are dining at their own home everything is cooked to order so you can enjoy a great experience n nchef danielle wa just in the az republic a one of the top chef s in arizona give this place an a went in for the first time great atmosphere smell of glorious food in there but what made me write this wa the service i got at the bar from mitch lyon he asked what i normally drink and what i expected from a drink so i told him he replied with a simple i got you came back with a piece of art hand crafted beautifully presented drink for the first one didnt think he could top it but made me a second that wa even better than the first hand down their best cocktail maker great food amazing drink beautiful atmosphere my only feedback is the staff seems to be under a lot of pressure to make sure everything is perfect this take away from the service and from them being personable if they weren t so robotic this place would be star a i m sure their natural personality would make this place more inviting we just happened upon the breadfruit today when we were downtown we loved it the bok choy mashed potato dish wa delicious especially the sauce on the bok choy and the tofu and rice dish had a great sauce too the best however wa the amazing sweet potato pudding with a coconut crust yum the spice level wa rather low so even people who don t like spicy food would be fine n nit wa a bit expensive for three people and we only ordered two dish to share but i would definitely go back went here for my birthday dinner cool looking place from the outside kind of small inside and very noisy besides patron yelling to talk over the noise there s music playing too wouldn t recommend for a romantic dinner all kind of rum drink so you better like rum beer choice and one red and one white arizona wine wife had the salmon and i had the jerk pork both dish ok but not memorable only one dessert available and didn t sound that good so didn t order it would go to hula s before this place better food better choice of drink more food and more reasonably priced probably won t be back this place is excellent the bartender gave me a bunch of recommendation including the pepper shrimp sword fish and sweet potato pie all of which were delicious i d highly recommend this place to eat then hang out in the outdoor patio afterward with the great music the fedora wearing character at the door thought he wa too cool for school none of the staff seemed genuine food wa nothing to jerk it over get it n nanywhoooooo star just because i could come back to smoke a cigar on the patio and the rum selection is good a well never tried the food so this is just for the bar part n nrum bar is a must in phoenix the owner is very knowledgable about his subject and will share all kind of story about rum and it history in the u if you ask protip ask why he doesn t stock bacardi n nthe cockails are excellent and made with only the best yes they are a little pricey but i ve never had a really good cocktail under so the price are reasonable considering n njust overall a great experience good service interesting conversation and fantastic cocktail and rum list a a bourbon gal i never knew rum could taste this complex and interesting a definite must go have eaten here three time and each time the food is delicious especially the pulled pork and the jerk shrimp also they akwsys have a special rum drink that totally satisfies when we re in the mood for an island feel service is spot on and friendly parking can be an issue at busy time but worth a try place is pretty good overall i stop going here because it wa too pricey and the portion were too small the drink were great the food wa palatable but the service wa absolutely terrible and i have never felt so unwelcome in a restaurant in my life n ni took lady here for my bachelorette party dinner we wanted a low key affair with good food and good drink and since i wa going to jamaica for my honeymoon we figured this wa the perfect place we are all working professional woman who are accustomed to fine dining and good service but unfortunately we got none of that at the breadfruit n nour waitress tried to push the most expensive thing on the menu multiple time despite my friend saying they don t like seafood she then tried to push everyone to order side of rice and pea i really wonder if they make a commission from selling rice and pea and also suggested that my friend order some for her year old son my friend went ahead and ordered it because she figured he could nibble on it if he wanted and it wouldn t be a big waste of money if he didn t like it or wasn t hungry more on this later n nanother friend asked the waitress if she could get her meal without anything banana related on the plate because she ha a banana aversion the waitress extremely rudely replied the menu say right there that no substitution are allowed and they aren t banana they re plantain my friend stated that she couldn t eat either banana or plantain and that she wasn t asking for a substitution but rather the omission of the plantain from the plate the waitress stated that it could not be done because it would ruin the presentation of the dish so i just piped up and told my friend i would take her plantain off the plate n nnow back to the rice and pea when the year old started eating it he spilled some of it onto the table and then wiped what he had spilled from the table onto the floor he s a year old after all he hadn t made a peep the entire time we were there nor did he ever try to get down from his adult sized chair so pushing some rice onto the floor wa not a huge transgression the waitress immediately came over and said in the rudest voice ever oh that s just great can you just not let him do that to which my friend replied don t you have a broom i will clean it up the waitress just rolled her eye and disappeared but never did bring a broom my friend and i are generous tipper and would have rewarded the waitress greatly for dealing with the aftermath of a toddler s dinner however after the rudeness we had experienced up to this point we couldn t take it any longer we asked the other waiter to speak to a manager and after about minute during which time our waitress never did reappear the manager finally came over and spoke to u he told u that the waiter would be serving u for the rest of our dinner instead of the waitress but he never did apologize for his employee s rude behavior n ni see from other yelp review that others have had similar experience with that waitress and i question if she is still employed solely based on her scallop and rice and pea upselling ability it wa clear she wanted to do a little work a possible and clear our table a quickly a possible n nif i had only gone for drink i would definitely go back again but i don t think the food is good enough for me to want to tolerate the utterly crappy service and i know can get good drink so many other place sorry breadfruit but i will be getting my jamaican food fix elsewhere from now on the vegan jamaican food wa embarrassing also guy you need to use salt sorry fantastic hide out near st st and pierce st in downtown phoenix this varribean gem is the real deal i know because i am also caribbean i wa very plesently surprise that they srrve the dish i grew up with but how authentic the flavor wa i even found my country s national drink sorrel n ni have been looking for a restaurant that serf caribbean cusine since i move to phoenix amazing food an ample selection of rum try cockspur spice run or mont gay if you wanna try barbadian rum the elegant flawless sophisticated island ambience invutes you to have seat and enjoy at the end of the meal you are presented wuth a post card of a picture of the bar you can either keeo it or write it to anyone in the u and the restaurant will mail it fir you smart marketing i sent mine to my family in tx military discount is also offered n nnot necessary fir the whole family but great foe mmeting friend and date night i absolutely love this place great spot for a date the atmosphere is off the chain this is the cleanest restaurant in the phoenix metropolitan area a piece home for anyone that understands check them out the food ha so much flavor and i can taste the professionalism and skill the service is adult and so attentive yet respectful of personal space and time i come here often the drink are great also whether you want to keep it simple or fancy it up a bit n ntonight i tried the chilean sea bass if you don t believe me try them out and prove me wrong i don t rate or post much because i m hard to impress this place is impressive they should call this place buttfruit every item on the menu taste like it ha already been digested i found the jerk chicken really only jerked at my wallet and gut after being served i wanted the recipe great if you need your colon cleansed they kill the chicken in the back this place is awesome food and cocktail are great and the staff actually take pride in what they do this is a gem in dt phoenix incredible is how i d describe our dining experience on our waiter wa top notch and asked if we d been there before we hadn t and how we heard about it check please arizona with that information he walked u through the rum menu stating that the left side are custom drink you ll only get at this restaurant and they re purposely in group with the top section paired with the appetizer the middle with dinner and the bottom with dessert we decided to try it this way we re very glad we did nmy wife had that day s punch bowl i had the shorty which we paired with the scallop i enjoyed my whole meal but let s just say i will come back for the scallop alone nnext we had the sugarfoot and the sometime in august with dinner my wife s sugarfoot wa her favorite drink of the night my drink had a smokey quality to it which made it very unique my wife had the curried dungeness crab salad and i had the jerk pork and polenta the pork wa succulent and flavorful with just a mild kick note i like spicy food so some may find the kick more substantial than mild but it wa just enough for a pleasant warmth for me i suspect the reviewer who found the scallop oppressively hot would disagree with me nfor dessert my wife had mutiny in the county and i had tradewind swizzle for our drink both were quite good and definitely sweet dessert drink hers wa very unique due to the irish moss ingredient we shared the chocolate creme brulé this wa done because i m not normally a big dessert eater and one or two bite of that will suffice and my wife can eat the rest well this creme brulé is smaller and better than most i could have eaten my own my wife too also enjoy her entire meal but she said she d come back for the dessert alone noverall we had an enjoyable dining experience from beginning to end we ll definitely be back last note make a reservation this is a small restaurant and you will very likely have a bit of a wait if you just drop in i went there for the first time with some friend to try it out the drink were sub par and the service wa horrible the owner flipped the tip we gave him on our face we were shocked to see this sort of behavior for no specified reason i have never written review before but i felt that i had to took some friend from northwest scottsdale wanted to show off the convenience of living downtown and walking to restruants had drink that were excellent with a wide variety of rum recipe service wa friendly and very professional we ordered appetizer and entre all great seafood dish it wa fresh and well prepared however the jerk rubbed item were all too hot to enjoy it would get five star if it wa food that wa not so hot that you could not taste it parked in front of this place while going to visit the phoenix public market we were pleasantly surprised to find out there were no freezer or microwave in this restaurant so that tell you right there that you are receiving fresh well prepared food we had to try the jerk plate a it wa caribbean food the spice wa nice and the food wa delicious the only thing that would make u not go back wa the small portion for the price but at least you know you are paying for quality they also had blue mountain coffee which wa awesome all in all if you have extra money want to taste something different good this is the place great ambiance knowledgable server not impressed by the menu selection curry goat wa tasty curry chicken fell short drink were a new experience very good tho low light bright color and soothing caribbean music set the mood for a casual dinner at breadfruit this restaurant offer a healthy alternative when eating out i started with the avacado spring roll which come with a delicious mango chutney and tropical slaw it wa nice to see a few vegetarian and vegan option on the menu the black bean coconut rice that came with my curried tofu wa delicious service is great and the place is so clean great food great service one of best place in phoenix i highly recommend the jerk chicken and the piña colada this is not a cheap sugar filled drink this is an authentic custom made high quality fresh ingredient and refreshing drink there s no point in making a reservation at breadfruit if they won t honor it or to be more precise they should be le deceptive about taking your reservation in our case we were given the impression that we d have to wait about minute for our little group on the phone they did tell u that there wa another party ahead of u what they didn t tell u wa that it would really be more like the minute time for the four adult and two kiddos when we made our way in the place wa half full but four two top were open and a large table for six wa reserved not for u of course and nobody wa leaving anytime soon n nwhile we waited a party of two walked in and wa seated a few minute later another two top near them turned over a little forward thinking would have been to seat the two at one of the other open table and put the other now free table together it would have been a tight fit but it could have worked n nneedless to say the breadfruit is small there is no waiting area and with the kiddos we weren t going to wait outside in the drizzle we waited in a hallway that lead to the bathroom until we couldn t wait anymore in the end we walked out one star for the cute ambiance but for nothing else this is the second time coming to the breadfruit the first time wa just for drink this time i got the full experience i loved it i wa out celebrating my th birthday with my sister we made reservation although it wasn t very busy for a saturday night we went early around pm they open at pm we sat outside at the table in front the waiter wa very knowledgeable in regard to the food and drink and he gave some really good recommendation i decided on the red strip curried prawn and shim sham a my drink i wa recommend both it wa very affordable a well the owner stopped by all of the table which i thought wa great made you feel very comfortable they had great caribbean music playing in the background the waiter wasn t overbearing although he did take a little long to pick up my card a we were waiting to leave but they gave me a free slice of pie on the house idk if it wa bc it wa my birthday or if it wa bc my sister use to be their health inspector lol great place definitely recommend it what is there to say about this place that hasn t already been said well first off they need to bring the spicy beef pattie s back seriously n nthe tilapia pattie is fantastic plantain avocado spring roll are good a well festival are great a well but save them for a desert n njerk chicken and shrimp it a staple here get it it good spicy so watch your mouth n nescovitch fish can t be beat for a downtown fish dish it runner up for best sleeper dish on the menu n nand the award for best sleeper of the menu n nbrown stew chicken come get some it is a fantastic total dish expect to see an empty plate when you are done the entire dish is delightful n nthe only downer the byob seems a little steep if drinking individual beer but i guess that just mean bring a six pack at a time hah wandered in after first friday sat right down no wait and it wa soooooo good tiny little place the kitchen smell amazing very affordable given the quality and portion of the food jerk chicken wa pretty spicy just how i like it my buddy ordered the scallop and said they were pretty much the best excellent drink order the coconut water and it is srved in a real coconut that you can scope the meat out of and the two piece musical outfit added great music to chill but definetly not overwhelm cant wait to go back this place is amazing food drink atmosphere all very good they are a rum exclusive bar restaurant and all of the drink sound amazing we had the punch bowl special some kind of spiced rum punch and the bourbon masquerade strong in a good way a an appetizer we had the rum glazed prawn and roti flatbread it wa sooo good that sauce then for dinner we ordered the escovitch fish festival red snapper and jerk pork and polenta shredded pork over polenta and a side of the roasted plantain mango dip yum yum yum it wa all very good but the escovitch fish wa by far the best it wa very fresh and had almost a sweetness to it like fresh crab i d definitely recommend going there for a nice night out not too fancy but not your average neighborhood grill i m already planning to go back soon awesome patio and knowledgable service amazing rum selection a well the food smelled amazing and i will definitely be back for that in the near future our bartender wa very helpful in helping u pick out different rum based cocktail and she wa spot on i m a whiskey man myself so she suggested the rum old fashion it wa a bit sweeter obviously but excellent flavor overall my wife ordered some concoction with rum and pureed kiwi which i could have seriously slurped down in a few gulp it wa so good the drink are a bit pricey and i think had they been a little le we would have stayed for another round but other than that we will absolutely visit this bar again and again this wa my first visit and being located in the heart of the art district in downtown phoenix wa appealing this small and quaint restaurant had great smell of the caribbean cuisine we were seated close to the rum bar area which wa neat to watch the bartender mixing an assortment of rum cocktail the punch rum had a light hint that wa unsweet and the lime sugar rum wa freshly squeezed lime with rum of course had to have the sweet plantain with mango dip the main meal wa some sort of a beef stew with yucca potato rolled into a ball the stew sauce wa unbelievably tasty ended the night with a cigar and year aged rum this restaurant is too cute a cozy dining room than can fit maybe people and a small adjacent wooden rum bar the food is excellent too there are only a few appetizer and entree on the menu but what they do they do well just beware that when they say an item is spicy they mean it n nthe roasted plantain with mango chutney were a delicious beginning to our meal i loved my pork belly with guava glaze served over mashed butter bean that were spiked with jamaican spice my friend raved about the prawn simmered in curry and red stripe beer another friend ordered the jerk spiced pulled pork i warned him that it would be spicy and i know he is not a huge fan of spicy food when he didn t finish his meal the item mysteriously failed to appear on the bill wa it an omission or did the server realize my friend didn t like it anyway that s not to say the dish wasn t good i think it wa just a little too spicy for him n nwe decided not to have dessert here and instead went to the art walk on roosevelt st the breadfruit is a little hard to find and there s only street parking but if you re downtown be sure to give it a try i really love this place i ve been about six time every time is fantastic the food is always outstanding the drink are top notch i love a restaurant when i feel like they really care about the quality and ingredient you really can t do wrong here womp womp n npros the cocktail really are great and if you re there on a le than busy night the bartender are very helpful and attentive n ncons the man who seat patron and take reservation is made of ice i ve had run in with him before but the most recent visit ha convinced me to stop trying he wa very short with our party of two a well a the other small party before and after u once we were seated no one stopped by for over minute for anything not water not i ll be right with you nothing it wa a if we weren t there at all it wa a decent night for them about half full on our side bar there were two other people sitting at the bench by the window at one point two men walked through the bar and attempted to enter the restaurant in order to pas along a message to some friend eating dinner when they were stopped by the host and asked to leave a this is a very small establishment and there is no room for you the men handled it well joking after the server walked away that apparently the place wa at critical mass my companion and i waited a few more minute trying to appear a hungry and thirsty a possible and then eventually gave up and walked out n ni recommend walking around the corner to pomo phoenix s best hidden secret n ndrinks the caipirinha s here are delicious caipirinha is a mojito like brazilian cocktail they have an array of imported rum and rum flight choice nfood i had the ox tail and it wa superb a bit spicy but definitely something i would order again nservice our waiter wa very knowledgeable about the drink selection and history behind the rum nambiance low lighting romantic n ni drove by this place dozen of time and had no idea what i wa missing a friend of mine recommended this place for happy hour i have been back twice since and am a big fan i m in town visiting a friend from texas and we are on a happy hour hunt so we went to the rum bar specifically for that what s interesting is that there is no happy menu the chef chooses plate to serve daily it s kind of a surprise n nfood nwe ordered the jerk pork slider and pork belly w plantain we were highly satisfied with the pork slider they had a good flavor and just enough heat however the pork belly w plantain wa not to our liking the dish is unique in term of composition and presentation but it s super small check out the photo and the pork belly consisted of no meat just pure pork belly fat it wa disappointing n nto drink we ordered the rum punch bowl special for the day it wa amazing full of ginger lemon honey rum etc i generally like drink on the sweeter side but this wa a great balance n nambiance it s casual upscale a good setting for friend or casual business there is nice caribbean music playing in the background it s definitely my style n nservice we sat at the bar there wa a new bartender in training which slowed thing down a bit but other than that it wa great n nif you don t want to eat that s fine but definitely go for a drink try the punch bowl special of the day dear breadfruit n nyou would be worthy of four star if you were not so utterly overpriced ni will however always take you up on a slice a dat sweet potato pie nand coffee if you insist upon it n n nsincerely nrachel cute little place tucked away on a side street in downtown phx nif you like rum then this is your place and if you don t like rum you might be persuaded i can t remember the number of different kind of rum they have over for sure nthe rum punch wa delicious smoky but fruity they had another drink made with rum and cream soda i really enjoyed a well nthey have a cigar lounge and the patio is nice to enjoy your rum and a nice cigar if you are into that sort of thing nthe restaurant a a whole ha a great vibe and ambiance everyone from bartender to hostess to wait staff were all very friendly and helpful when choosing drink and food nif you like jamaican food that is the specialty i m not a huge fan the food wa good but i just didn t find it to be off the chart fantastic i had the curried goat tasted good but the goat wa fatty and chewy my husband had the pork belly big ol hunk of bacon essentially the first hunk wa pure fat no meat at all the other slice had a good combo of fat and meat but he wa also not entirely impressed our other friend got the jerk chicken which looked really good noverall the drink are strong and delicious but the food wa overpriced and just ok i would definitely come back for drink though the gap between perception and reality here is amazing great website and beautiful build out of the restaraunt nthe first clue that something wa off wa that they made u wait to be seated in an almost empty restaraunt it wa clear that it wa policy that you had to wait no matter what nour waiter had the telltale sign of a current or previous meth addiction he wa extremely pushy on upselling he knocked my very expensive sunglass to the floor and scratched them and thought an appropriate comment wa at least they are only plastic nthe food wa simply not good mashed potato wa not even mashed pork wa way over cooked my mojito had endless piece of mint in it every sip i had to spit out mint the mint wa also very old i make a lot of mojitos and you have to leave the mint in the fridge for over a month to look like that nthey claim no microwave on their website but my mash wa only partially warm and clearly not made that day ni ve since read review of the place and they apparently look down on chain restaraunts sadly the food and drink doe not rise to the level of a well run chain i m no fan of chain but i ve had a lot better meal in strip mall chain than this place nif you like good food stay away if fake it until you make it work for you this place would be number one omg the pina colada i have quite a bit of experience with rum and the pina colada at breadfruit is the most balanced and delicious rum drink i have ever tasted the fresh flavor with just the right amount of sweetness will make you completely rethink your perception of what is typically a sugary frozen concoction served with an umbrella n nvibe wa downtown cool with fun jamaican beat playing our service wa excellent so a far a the negative service review either they have gotten it together or we dined on an on night our server wa knowledgeable and made great recommendation even suggesting drink pairing to complement out entree n nthe scallop appetizer wa yummy a little on the small side with scallop so dont plan to share if there are more then at the table the jerk seasoning wa yummy and had a great kick i had the prawn curry and really enjoyed the entire dish a generous helping of prawn with sauteed veggie and perfectly cooked rice and pea again many have complained about the rice but it wa cooked nicely n nour server suggested a mojito a a paring with the curry and i took her suggestion i get nervous ordering mojitos because some bartender use mint syrup v fresh mint which is totally nasty and many tend to over sweeten the drink not the case here again perfect balance between tart and sweet and the best mojito i have had outside of my secret recipe n nfor dessert there wa a deep internal struggle between ordering the sweet potato pudding and enjoying another pina colada since i wa the driver the puddin won out it wa a unique dessert not very sweet and nicely complimented by whipped cream flavored with even more rum i read a few poor review for the size of the dessert ok people this is not the claim jumper the size wa perfect for sharing and a completely appropriate size for a dessert if you want a ginormus hunk of cake you can go to chili or claim jumper and enjoy the side of diabetes seriously what is wrong with america soapbox n nall in all an amazing experience and will definitely be back bill wa about for of u the food wa very reasonable but with cocktail each there wa no way we were getting out of there under a hundy that being said the quality flavor and service made it more then worth it wowza we had an amazing time and meal last night n nlet me start off by addressing some of the previous review it is a local business so relax on the corporate expectation this place is obviously very proud of their product so if you are expecting food variation manipulation you should go to applebee s their food beverage preparation is a craft and should be experienced a presented n ntheir jerk chicken wa out of this world an explosion of taste it is prepared with rice and veggie i like my food spicy and it didn t disappoint n nthis is a must for special occasion small intimate and very clean yes the price point are high you get what you pay for in ambiance quality and experience too often phoenix resident fail to realize that we are one of the cheapest big city in the nation this place is worth the experience and it separate itself from the norm in downtown phoenix this place is phenomenal wa in town for a work conference from ny and decided to give it a try i wa in phoenix a few month before and all of my food wa terrible so i wa weary this place knock it out of the park it wa a little bit but spicy for me could only eat half my jerk chicken because the run wa so spicy but it generally enhanced the flavor instead of decimated them also i am not a rum drinker don t like sweet and the sugarcane normally give me a headache but i had two cocktail here and they both were off the chart be warned the appetizer portion are small but it s fine for an appetizer my jerk chicken and my colleague s salmon entree were plentiful this is a cute little place for dinner and a drink but make reservation i wa with a party of four two in the group had been here before we decided to wait the minute for a table because they said the food wa that good even though the yelp ranking wa a little low n nthe waitress and a sidekick with a mustache that reminded me of salvador dali s arrived at the table they had that aura about them that made my dining experience entertaining and brings a smile to my face every time i think about their performance n nmy entree wa the three stripe shrimp and it wa spicy and full of what i would expect to find in a flavorful jamaican dish i also tasted all of the entree at my table and found none lacking my table also ordered the two dessert that were offered by the waitstaff duo a breadfruit and a chocolate creme brûlée both were very good and worth any health risk from sugar or caloric waste n ntasting all the drink at my table my favorite were the piña colada and the ginger infused rum drink my lovely waitress suggested that the piña colada would be the best that i have ever tasted and yes it rank up there particularly since the trip to the rum factory in the caribbean are a little hazy to recall n nso a solid star food and drink experience but the outstanding performance of sophistication from the waitstaff take this to a star standout there wa no spiced rum at all i wa shocked that the rum bar had no spiced rum also they only have a handful of drink on the drink menu and don t make anything else so if you have a favorite rum drink it better be on the menu or you can t get it also price could be better for what they offer drink and dessert wa dollar which is a little much on the plus side the bartender wa very friendly and helpful and did allow me to try some rum to see if i liked them breadfruit filled a vacuum in phoenix by creating authentic jamaican food and drink for a downtown that ha suffered from a dearth of interesting restaurant n nwe ate there once several month ago in fact i think it wa their first week open for business my girlfriend and i were impressed and did come back even though their tasty veggie meat wa out of stock and couldn t make u the veggie meal we came seeking that day n nfast forward to last weekend some friend scored four diamondback ticket and i thought since we ll have some drink at the stadium why not try breadfruit again we could take the light rail and it s only two or three block from the light rail station n nwe brought a six pack of red stripe to complete the experience and it wa a delight to be back we saw one of the owner who we recognized and liked when we met her but didn t see her partner who is the cook and is jamaican our friend were impressed by the food which held it s own n nwe had fish escovich jerk chicken coconut curry tofu and side order of plantain all hit everything wa cooked to order and impressed our friend the steamed veggie and rice and bean on my plate were delicious and complimented my coconut curry tofu it s actually a little more like seitan their byob policy worked well a we were able to finish off a six pack and get back to the light rail to head to chase field n ngood people excellent food and an ambiance that is worthy of a downtown phoenix revival good work breadfruit i wish others would take your lead upon reading some of these review i thought i had walked into the wrong place it is an intimate higher end dining establishment not an applebee s or some drunk woo girl scottsdale bar it sounded like the person nwho went before u wa looking for the waiting service to come out and sing happy birthday n ni ve been hard pressed to find anywhere else in arizona with this combination of concept and execution the wait staff wa informative and insightful the food is always fresh and the menu is constantly evolving i highly recommend the seared scallop appetizer to start the night you won t regret it the classic jerk chicken off the bone is everything you re looking for in a jamaican dish the fresh cabbage slaw that accompanies the chicken provided the citrusy contrast that you need to elevate the spiciness of the dish they coconut curry tofu is packed with island flavor and is great for the vegetarian out there and for desert get the sweet potato pie my friend and i went to breadfruit and rum bar on friday night i wa the last one to show up but from what i wa told wa the host wouldn t sit u because everyone wasn t present he even offered to sit them at a table sef for but my friend said no cause i wa coming when i arrived he took u on the patio and sat u at a table for which confused u because the table had been empty before my arrival after they told me about their experience with the host i told them i had checked out previous review and seen a couple stating the host is rude we joked that host must come up with various way to continue putting off customer for the sake of continuing the rude reputation nour waiter wa nice but didn t seem to enthusiastic probably a long night all of u were having a good time and taking most everything with a grain of salt but he just wouldn t perk up any he did bring u these tasty little mint leaf gelatin thing i forgot what it wa called to cleanse our palate for the meal it wa quite nice and refreshing nour food wa pretty good i ordered the tofu along with my friend she said hers wa cold but mine wa warm others got salad and chicken and enjoyed their meal nothing that stand out too much i take that back there wa a slice of bell pepper perfectly cooked that little bit wa simply amazing the ginger beer and sorrel were both delicious if you decide to go i definitely recommend both drink however if you do go order your drink early it took minute each for a bottle of red stripe and a pina colada ni gave this place two star because other than the drink when we got them and bell pepper slice nothing else wa memorable maybe i ll try it again eventually and see if we went on an off day pure charm in every way and a perfect kitchen fantastic bartender it s one of the valley s best tuesday night party of four service wa amazing and drink were on point waiter knew every detail of the menu and we took his recommendation n n of u order the jerk pork omg it wa the best jerk pork and polenta we ve had we were worried about having jamaican food in phoenix but this placed killed it n nexcited to go back and see what the weekend vibe is like at rum bar overall highly recommend for out of towner great atmosphere great location this must be an up and coming section of phoenix the restaurant is a little hard to spot thank goodness for gps we found a free parking spot a block away very attractive dark wood interior the main dining room is a little noisy when busy but that s to be expected friendly server we had the hemingway daiquiri s and they were delicious hubby tried the fine arizona wine i recommend you skip that and stick to the rum drink our food came out very quickly he enjoyed his jerk pork with polenta after a week of eating stadium food at various sport venue i found the mixed green salad with jerk prawn really hit the spot we were able to walk from there to symphony hall a few block n nthis is a note to the service industry in general i don t want to downgrade this particular restaurant i really cannot stand to look at people with thing hanging out of their nose some kind of ring or something it look like they forgot to wipe away their snot if the waitress thought i wa rude because i never looked at her while she wa talking to u that is why i m sure this is some kind of self expression trend but i think it s disgusting if you don t want to drive away customer don t hire people like that or insist they take it out for work i am a west indian from houston tx and am working out in the desert in az for month i looked up this place online and i am regretting i visited this place i arrived well dressed with a pocket full of money and very hungry around pm and wa the first customer it wa my first visit and no one told me where to sit or dine until this rude skinny little half island black man with short twisted dred lock approached me i told him it wa my first visit and asked him where to sit and he told me if i do not have reservation i would have to sit at the bar and eat how friggin rude so i sat at the bar and noticed all of the worker were white or hispanic and can tell they mostly catered to white or yuppie folk trying to get an island feel however i wa born in the caribbean and hate when other wanna be island folk like this skinny black idiot at the breadfruit rum and bar treat their own in disgrace however the bartender brian made an excellent drink from my country s angustora year rum and i wanted another one but wa too hungry so i left i then went to caribbean cuisine on the glendale side of town and though it wa in a rougher area they welcomed me with open arm like true caribbean people do by far one of my favorite restaurant in the valley i wa introduced by my cousin christina and jennifer five year ago and i still get just a excited to eat dinner and have my glass of carrot juice a if it wa my first time the food is fresh and original and there s never a bad meal the first time i went it wa on a friday evening the small place wa filled but they only had one waitstaff on duty and it took u an hour and min to get food that totally sucked n nyesterday went back and the place wa empty and we were served immediately the first time i ordered the jerk chicken and it wa barely seasoned yesterday we ordered the jerk shrimp and the jerk sauce wa hot and tasty but the shrimp wa over cooked n nthe stick of bread are awesome and kinda sweet and so are the soda that they serve they are jamaican and made with real sugar cane n ni ll be back but i had much higher hope i have been regretting this review nwhy because i did my research wa looking forward to trying it i read the review and i wa comfortable that i knew what to expect i went in on a whim on i truly did enjoy my meal and experience only to come home and within a few hour experience one of the worst case of food poisoning i have had in year n nthe wait staff is very good at garnering the up sale they were very friendly and professional i went with the escoviche fish recommendation blacked fish with coleslaw and a grilled pineapple slice the mango lemonade and the sweet potato puddin almost for just me i felt it a bit over priced even with out my food poisoning nlike i mentioned earlier everything wa good and very flavorful i wa content and full on the way home i wa feeling nothing more than a good meal and initially prepared to give it at least star n nit is almost day later and i am still not back to normal ni don t plan on stopping in anytime soon thoroughly enjoyed everything about this place the service wa the best i ve had in year star all the way the only reason i didn t give this place star is because it s too small food wa amazing and a i said our server joni wa fabulous pro authentic jamaican cuisine with an organic twist food wa very well seasoned waitress christian wa knowledgeable and funny drink were visually stunning strong and delicious rum is the only liquor they offer but they have eclectic drink recipe that will please everyone in your party i myself am a bourbon and vodka girl lot of buzz and great energy in the bar area ncons i made reservation a week in advance for a team dinner i specifically chose this place for two out of four people in my party one being myself to have the curry goat only to be told that the farmer they usually source ther goat from wa simply out of goat and therefore they hadnt had goat on the menu for month i informed our waitress that they should take this item off the website and menu furthermore it is business to only use one supplier one of the person in my party is apache indian and said they have ton of goat quite frankly we were both dumb founded i ordered a second dish to go and wa also told i wa lucky because they don t allow to go order because they cant guarantee the food quality once it leaf the establishment but they would allow it since i had already eaten there to that i say again i m dumbfounded guess you wont be able to order on ubereats post mate etc we ended up coming here for dinner and drink before our flight back to new york from the phoenix airport needle to say we had suitcase with u and they were more than accommodating they sat u at a table that had a little extra room by it so we had space to put our bag they didn t make u feel like a burden which we really appreciated having said that the server definitely get a perfect ten for hospitality our waiter even showed u some dish he carried out for other table to show u what it wa such a nice touch n nnow for the best part the food let me tell you that i have had very authentic caribbean food on quite a few island and this wa wonderfully prepared thoughtful dish with a perfect blend of spice and sauce the desert wa fantastic too n nno matter what you order on the menu you must order a cocktail if you don t drink they have some beautiful looking non alcoholic drink a well they really know how to make a unique drink the only downside wa that the happy hour didn t apply at the table just the bar i know a ton of restaurant do this and it s not like they re the only one but still a bummer excellent food service and atmosphere jose wa super friendly and acommodating haven t tried drink or dinner yet will update review when we do the drink were fabulous and the meal wa delicious i loved the ambiance of the restaurant too the scallop were great i would highly recommend those amazing amazing food amazing drink i m in love number phoenix spot for me cute and cozy atmosphere and i like restaurant where the kitchen is exposed the jerk chicken wa very tender and i liked the coconut rice it came with i would definetly come back i didn t feel this place wa the real deal i go to jamaica fairly often and have eaten at some really great restaurant in new york and los angeles when i asked the host part owner why there were no jerk wing on the appertizer menu he decided to give me a cultural lecture on how in his country jamaican eat the whole bird not sure what that had to do with my question but anyway the food wa tasty but weak just like the drink hard for me to take any jamaican restaurant seriously with no jerk wing on the menu i mean really overpriced for amount of food you get a well also overrated i had high hope for this place and it is really too bad because i love to support the phoenix area restaurant especially a caribbean one and i had already been to the adjoining rum bar and loved the drink but the food wa bad it wa not only bad but by all mean avoid the daily market catch it wa not fresh at all very over priced for nearly for a simple white fish they could have at least taken the bone out of the thing it tasted like it had been sitting around all day or two in it own juice and when i let the waiter bartender know he just ignored it and then ignored u until we left i will never be back for the food the rum flight are worth a trip there but that is it came with a party of cocktail where unbeatable and i felt fairly priced our waitress wa knowledgable a far a ingredient i had plantain spring roll and my friend had jerk chicken entree very happy with both really a rum lover heaven i wa dying for some jamaican food but the only thing jamaican about this place wa the bartender a big disappointment one of our cousin wa in town visiting so we decided to bring her to the breadfruit and rum bar for cocktail and dinner this place exceeded our expectation the food is absolutely delicious this isn t a hole in the wall type of ethnic place although i do love those this is a classy joint with fancy gorgeously plated dinner item portion are a little small but the taste more than make up for that i had the brown stew chicken which is le of a stew and more of melt in your mouth chicken in brown sauce i also sampled the jerk chicken great spice and the coconut mackerel rundown like a tunafish on a chewy wonton i ve never tasted anything like it before but it wa delicious a weird a it sound the cocktail were so well crafted with really subtle flavor that paired well with our meal the daily rum special in a large punch bowl out front wa a guava inspired drink so i wa in heaven i also sampled the mr smith very strong and with great flavor again the shim sham light and fruity and the bourbon masquerade very aptly named it tasted so much like bourbon the creativity and flavor of the cocktail were fantastic and the place ha a literal wall of rum to choose from when designing their drink the price are a little expensive but it s definitely worth it for a special night n nthe only thing holding me back from giving star wa the service our waitress wa a little pushy appearing visibly upset when we didn t order a small plate appetizer to go with our entree and drink and she came off a cold and somewhat snobby overall still probably only one person and maybe she wa just having a bad night n noverall check this place out great way to experience jamaican food my first time eating here wa great the cocktail i ordered wa well balanced and tasty the service wa excellent my server christian wa super knowledgeable about the food and cocktail and gave me some excellent recommendation she wa truly passionate about the food i loved my meal and the cocktail i chose i had the salmon and it wa cooked and seasoned perfectly i can t wait to go back very unfriendly staff it s not a welcoming environment everyone seems very unhappy and miserable nthe food is just ok the cocktail are good nnot worth the and i won t be going back came here with some friend for drink the other night every single cocktail we got wa fantastic and we ordered each from the st nd and rd course in that order we had the rum punch apple onia and hot buttered rum lucas our waiter wa very prompt and recommended some darn good drink n nnow for the not so good and for this section i rename the place upper bread crust rum lounge allow me to explain our group of wa very diverse and we found the gentleman who showed u to our seat to be very judgemental he accused one of u of smelling funny and almost did not let u in despite a reservation we were allowed in and were seated in the back cigar lounge my wife and i visit a local phoenix restaurant every weekend and never have we experienced this kind of treatment finally our seating location in the back also seemed to be the main travel path for the staff taking out trash and bringing in ingredient we felt like we were in their way a we socialized interrupted several time with rude excuse me s n nwe won t be going back simply due to judgemental and rude staff editing my previous review because i decided to give the rum bar another chance i m glad that i did it wa a totally different experience during my subsequent visit i tried the pina colada which is out of this world good the service during our subsequent visit wa infinitely better infinitely i m surprised we decided to give this place another shot after our initial experience but i m glad we did it must have been an off night because our following visit have been consistently good n nold review below n ni really wanted to love this place n nmy husband and i just moved to phoenix from the east coast he s a native of the caribbean coast of venezuela and i lived there for many year we know good rum when we saw the aptly named rum bar wa only block from our home in the art district we were super happy we decided to give it a go on a night of celebration n nfrom the moment we walked in there wa confusion they were about minute away from closing which we assumed wa ample time for a drink and an appetizer i noticed that they had two of our favorite venezuelan rum when i explained to the bartender what kind of rum we typically like and asked if she could recommend something similar so we can broaden our horizon a bit she looked a bit wide eyed and proceeded to ask a man who wa sitting on the corner of the bar who i am going to assume is the owner that became the precedent for the evening we asked a question she asked the man at the bar perhaps it wa her first night and that s ok but a few smile would have turned this review into a positive one in addition to her overall unfriendly demeanor we simply couldn t get over how pretentious the place felt my husband ordered a cuba libre the bartender hesitated much longer than wa necessary and told him we serve that rum in a snifter effectively telling him he couldn t order what he wanted she then brought him a flight of rum which wasn t even the same brand a the drink he had ordered when we both looked confused she took it away and started to pour another flight by now we were really irritated and felt really unwelcome my husband corrected her again please i d like a cuba libre rum is fun people maybe not wherever the owner is from but in venezuela it s passed around at the beach we drink it at every party formal or otherwise cuba libre is a perfectly legitimate cocktail just a legitimate a the mojito i ordered which i will say wa excellent hence the two star instead of one when it wa clear we weren t going to accept the flight of rum she wa trying to force on u she walked over the the man at the bar yet again who laughed at our pedestrian choice of drink and waved his hand in resignation she then brought my husband the tiniest most watered down rum and coke imaginable not a cuba libre a rum and coke no lime to speak of when he asked for a lime to turn his rum and coke into some semblance of a cuba libre she said oh you wanted lime with that incredulously n nwe ordered the plantain spring roll with mango chutney they were utterly tasteless except for the chutney it wa basically store bought frozen won ton wrapper and not a hint of sweet plantain not one hint n nwe re exceptionally disappointed that we didn t love this place the only redeeming factor not for u we won t be back are the price which are reasonable and their good selection of rum i wa in phoenix for a conference and found the breadfruit through a web search it s just a short walk nw of the convention center the first night i wa there i wa amazed at the bar s wall full of rum more than variety but more about that later the dining area wa rather small but i wa able to get a table during the week not the same story on a weekend night reservation are recommended the waitstaff had spot on description of the food and cocktail and wa passionate about the fare the menu had quite a lot of seafood option from mussel to prawn to the catch of the day red snapper when i visited the scallop appetizer wa delicious two large juicy scallop seasoned to perfection i wa glad i took the waiter s recommendation and ordered the prawn the curry sauce wa creamy with a mild flavor since i couldn t decide between that or the jerk i had to come back a couple night later to try the free range jerk chicken which wa savory and spicy both meal were exceptional and my only regret wa that i wasn t in phoenix longer to try some other dish the meal ranged between and now back to the rum bar the bar staff is very knowledgeable and friendly during my two visit i tried several of the cocktail and wa not disappointed with any each drink wa made with fresh ingredient and with a variety of rum you ll not find captain morgan or bacardi here rather rum from the caribbean and central america dominate and they even have a rum from tennessee with a bit of a bourbon taste you ll also not find whiskey or vodka just rum red stripe and wine they offer some rum flight at a reasonable price and it s a great opportunity to try different brand of rum and different age the owner and bartender will tell you anything you want to know about the various rum i felt like i should have been taking note i cannot recommend the breadfruit highly enough and will definitely return again on my next visit to phoenix if you re traveling for a convention steer away from the chain and concept restaurant at cityscape and try this independently owned authentic taste of jamaica this wa a great place to have a dinner n nwe arrived ordered a number of different cocktail appetizer and entree and we were not disappointed n nfrankly i d go back if i lived in the neighborhood pompous n nthis review is based solely on the service on one individual the manager refused to seat my party because individual were running a bit behind we wished to order appetizer and drink while we waited but were told we would not be able to be seated until the arrived instead we opted to sit at the bar and have a drink however the management thought that wa not acceptable a well and demanded we wait outside all of this occurred a the restaurant lay empty at pm on a saturday night n nafter reading other review this seems to be a common theme for breadfruit i wont be coming back i pray ownership take notice of this trend and remedy the problem before they close their door this little place absolutely rock your tastebud have visited twice and will make it a regular lunch stop the jerk chicken is absolutely delicious and yes a bit spicy a it should be we ve also had the avocado plantain spring roll amazing and the spinach pattie the mango lemonade with mint is so refreshing and tasty n ndon t deprive yourself of lunch at the breadfruit one of downtown s very best n nupdate they no longer serve lunch it a nice place the rum bar make an ol fashioned with rum that i had never had it wa pretty good cant really say the same about the food though it wa ok im jamaican expected better the portion were very small for the price i ll probably go back and try it more time or at least for drink n kanye shrug the food is good for the most part salt is their favorite ingredient so if you really like to taste the food you won t the ingredient are top notch i did not try any of the drink but they looked good and many others were enjoying them this would be a good place to have a drink before a show tasty jamaican food and delicious fruity drink but overpriced for the fare atmosphere service just ok the back patio is really nice but there are so many wonderful place to eat downtown i d skip this one short review drink are overpriced service wa good cod fritter sauce wa to salty ambiance is excellent polenta is amazing smoked pork is kinda bland and rum flight are decent food wa great service wa horrible to the point i completely forgot how good the food wa we arrived at happy hour time they would not want to accomadate the happy hour price then they refused to give any pepper or some chilli to my friend whose food wa not spicy enough then when my guest arrived later they would refuse to put a chair at our table though are table wa big enough to seat two more people there easily and after all these annoying push back they would not split check and out of u had to do our own math and the last strike wa when the server came and told a friend that she had to sign a tab seriously people you have a restuarant in az don t you know any amount under doe not have to be signed in state of az bottom line if this restaurant doe not start to accomadate their guest they will loose customer i know i will not go back there again and will not recommend them to any one i know this wa a perfect date night after a horrible week of not seeing my husband due to his job n nwe knew we wanted to go out for dinner and breadfruit ha been on my list of place to go since we moved here finally tonight wa the night we decided to go n nwe didn t have a reservation but went around early dinner suit u nthey seated u outside tonight wa perfect for it around degree and amazing no chill just perfect and comfortable n nrum punch so good scallop delicious we shared them i had the lobster he had the house special red snapper we were both very happy with our meal the portion were perfect we love experiencing more flavor and high quality food over large portion i love leaving a meal not feeling stuffed but perfect content this wa that feeling n nall the drink which came recommended by our great server were smooth and oh so good the coconut bread pudding wa also very yummy and crisp on the outside and soft on the inside i wanted a little something like creme fraiche or a small bit of ice cream for it but it wa very good on it s own n ni would certainly return again but it wa definitely a splurge but a very happy splurge the food is ok but the service is absolutely terrible recently i stopped by the restaurant with a party of on a friday night at p m the restaurant wa near empty and we inquired for a table but the host wa extremely snobby and impatient he told u there wa a hour wait even though there were at least three table available that could accommodate u when i asked to be put on the waiting list he rolled his eye and said that he would only accept a waitlist for a party of when i asked whether they could even seat he again rolled his eye that it s there wa a pizzeria down the street that this restaurant wa for a more intimate setting n nhis explanation wa perfectly reasonable but his tone wa extremely condescending this is downtown phoenix not la and we certainly are not at a michelin star restaurant love this place i ve been here twice and both time have had excellent drink and food with service that wa knowledgeable classy and made great recommendation moving to az from s fl i miss caribbean food and this place get it done although a bit more upscale than the actual caribbean can t wait to go back the caribbean food that i m used to deep fry just about everything fried plantain empanadas etc load you up with rice leaf you feeling like you might develop instant diabetes n nthe breadfruit wa the perfect change from that n nthe decor is great i felt transported to somewhere tropical almost like i could step outside on the beach not in a tacky way it wa very authentic made me think of past excursion to the caribbean the patio wa cute but small so we opted to stay inside service wa everything i expect from waitstaff our waitress wa super attentive knowledgeable n ni ordered a couple of cocktail from the rum bar which i definitely recommend doing mojito classic to start the meal because i m boring also beet the blue because i couldn t look away from it both were glorious n nwe started the meal with plantain avocado spring roll interesting the mango chutney wa the star of that dish my boyfriend ordered the jerk chicken salad i wasn t expecting much from a salad but it wa great you can tell everything is made with fresh quality ingredient i wish more restaurant were like this n ni had the guava glazed pork belly melt in your mouth pork with a tangy sweet sauce if i wa a little more tipsy i probably would have licked my plate the mash included on the plate wa also delicious but i find myself fantasizing over the pork belly so good n nall in all it wa great i can t wait to go back the breadfruit is a staple restaurant for my girlfriend and i we re usually in here once a month or so it s a small quiet restaurant tucked into downtown while small it s nicely decorated with rotating local artist work displayed on the wall service is always very friendly and usually pretty quick n nthe entres are all generally pretty first rate though i usually get the curried chicken the brown stew chicken and jerk chicken are both excellent choice on the vegetarian side of thing the pop cho with ginger is amazing i love the sweet potato mash with garlic unfortunately it wasn t on the menu the last time i wa there not sure if it ll be making a return or not n npersonally i like spicy food so i ve never had any issue with it being overly hot in term of consistency it s always fresh and excellent one of the more consistent restaurant in this regard most of the entree are in the range which i think is very reasonable n nif i wa going to nitpick at anything it d be the appetizer not the quality which is generally very good the festival with the nice mango chutney are usually our pick but the pricing with shrimp and scallop appetizer being more expensive than most the entree it just seems odd though i m sure getting quality fresh seafood in phoenix probably isn t cheap n n edit breadfruit now ha a liquor license and is no longer byob bummer n nalso their special tend to be significantly pricier than most their menu item like double average entree cost but they don t go out of their to mention this so be sure to ask pricing on the special hmmm where do i start save your money n nhonestly if you don t mind paying through the ear for a mediocre meal then feel free and pay a visit but don t say yelp reviewer didn t give you fair warning n nso i wa taken here for my birthday and i wa super excited i had heard good review and could not wait to get my hand on some stew chicken n nwe started out with the drink menu the mango drink with mint is very good and reasonably priced compared to everything on the menu n nsince we heard the portion were small we decided we would each get an app share and then each order entree n nthe festival with mango chutney taste wa good price wa ridiculous they seriously make tiny breadstick cut them in half and stick it in a small bowl of chutney i don t care what fancy ingredient you use but for at least add some more breadstick n nthe plantain and avocado roll were also small the plantain wa not even fully ripened and the cost wa these ingredient are not fancy or expensive and the flavor wa disappointing n ni decided that i wa going to get the the jamaican patty with fish but after being slightly confused by the waitress i ended up ordering the chef special appetizer omg what a mistake n nthe chef s special wa fish springrolls with mango and spinach or some other green served with a spicy sauce the flavor wa bitter and it needed more fish especially when i saw the price after the bill came for the smallest spring roll in the world and the fish in it probably the scrap left over after they get the filet off the bone for an entree n nthe stew chicken that i wa soo excited about ehhh i ve made better with a half as recipe n nthe only thing i found that wa rare and delicious wa a boiled green banana that is hard to find in phoenix although a roasted sweet potato or yam would have fit in a well n nthe curry chicken and dumpling is a joke you get about small piece of a cut chicken breast and a big dense dumpling i wa afraid to take too much when i asked if i could taste so i took a sliver or chicken and a sliver of dumpling not impressed n nthe rice and plantain on the plate wa ok but again the plantain wa not fully ripened n nthe best thing on my plate wa grilled piece of cabbage and the boiled banana n nnow that i think of it for a restaurant that is is focused on local ingredient and the experience of eating your food etc why the heck would they serve mango plantain and green banana and anything with fish for that matter seems at odds with the philosophy n nall in all diner repeat customer n nthe space is nice the service is friendly n nfood is ok price are ridiculous ni would not recommend it to my friend in all it wa an amazing dining experience n nwe made reservation which i strongly recommend that you do our server tamara wa a delight this wa a first time experience for each of u and she walked u though the menu and wa very helpful and friendly n natmosphere and environment nthe decor and arrangement of the restaurant is really interesting it s very tight quarter but comfortable n nservice nthis is a big one for me we experienced some good and some not so good n waited at the door for several minute before anyone greeted u the first person who did wa the bartender who told u to sit and wait not unpleasant but i would expect a simple hello we will be right with you or at least some acknowledgment when we first walked in n table side server wa great but thing did slow down the longer we sat there at one point i had to drink water from my boyfriend s glass because i had been empty so long n we had menu item that were d and we were not able to try them red snapper a rum and a dessert n we were told we could go out to the cigar patio by one server and order dessert once we were out there told by another server that we could not n nfood drink n the food wa amazing it s a combination of spice and favor that i m not used i will say it s not for everyone but it really is delicious n it is a little pricey n the drink are amazing we each ordered signature drink and rum flight n dessert kinda terrible i can only assume it wa authentic some kind of sweet potato pie with coconut and molasses but we didn t like at all n nin all it wa a great evening with friend and we made memory that we will cherish i m not sure that we will be back unless an opportunity arises but i m glad i did try it had never realized the breadth of rum s flavor recommend pulling up to the bar and allowing the bartender to guide you pairing cocktail with course everything eaten and sipped knocked my sock off most notably the scallop clam and all the kong s men the latter look like a storm cloud mysterious and lovely this establishment is a gem i little bit of montego bay in the middle of downtown phoenix what a pleasant surprise to walk into this oasis of reggae and caribbean food the atmosphere and vibe at the bar are relaxed and tropical the decor match the theme with distressed wood and bright color all that s missing is a whiff of ganja and you d be in jamaica i ate in the bar area but the menu come from breadfruit the adjoining restaurant i enjoyed the food i had the jerk prawn avocado salad and boy wa it spicy the menu indicates heat so be aware they aren t kidding the salad wa huge with lot of avocado and prawn this could be a meal for most people i also had the jerk chicken and it wa well prepared and also spicy the side were colorful a cabbage pineapple slaw i had a few glass of local wine by the glass at happy hour price and enjoyed it who knew arizona made wine the bartender wa friendly and attentive and the crowd eating at the bar wa chatty and friendly a well i will definitely go back the next time i am in the area i ll pack my bob marley t shirt so i can blend in dear breadfruit n we became acquainted on the internet like so many relationship these day do and i must admit that i became fascinated with you quickly your menu sang to me with so many tasty word and your location couldn t be better n nwe finally met last night and i am disappointed while you have a very cheery atmosphere and wonderful staff your food just didn t woo me at all the fish wa overcooked burned on the end even and left me unsatisfied the slaw looked promising but proved to be nearly impossible to eat you try picking up long string of cabbage and bean sprout just see what happens and the breadstick oy the taste of it wa fantastic but it wa so overdone that i thought for a second that i might have to send you a dentist s bill if i finished it n nmy dining companion wa enamored with your curry tofu sadly the one bite of his tofu ended up being the highlight of my meal sigh n ni wish that thing had turned out better breadfruit because i really wanted to like you but when visiting you leaf me hungry for the hole in the wall caribbean place on camelback and th ave i know that it just isn t going to work out n ngood luck to you n np did a midget design your bathroom i had no idea they even made sink that small the breadfruit offer a world class caribbean cocktail and culinary experience unique to itself so if you re acquainted with the flavor of the caribbean the breadfruit is quite familiar to the palate they successfully deliver the essence of the caribbean though masterfully created complex and exciting unique cocktail and food item while the breadfruit definitely ha the best cocktail in phoenix the atmosphere there provides a bit of an escape from the desert s valley the ambiance is classy and sophisticated yet warm and friendly and very different from anything else downtown it delivers the relaxed vibe and delicious flavor you ll recognize from the island and it s where i go in phoenix to escape phoenix it s party on the palate what great time on saturday night loved the whole fried red snapper and pina coladas the drink were tasty the food wa delicious the restaurant is cool and charming would go back in a heartbeat i found this place a few year back but just never

salsa great pairing ni m glad to be back in phoenix we haven t been to breadfruit in a long time and we were pleasantly surprised we remembered the cozy little spot with good food and decided to go back i d definitely go there again we had a reservation and we were greeted seated and had a waiter at out table within minute saturday night it wa crowded but they handled it well n nthe meal wa spectacular i always look at the accompaniment and the jerk chicken off the grill came with roasted vegetable and dirty rice the rice wa cooked perfectly the grain were identifiable and crisp the veggie were superb squash broccoli and parsnip crisp and presented well the chicken wa ample and done a well a i ve ever had the best part wa the sauce that came with the chicken i considered asking for a glass of it so i could drink it but i didn t have the nerve n nbesides supporting a local merchant go there you ll get a great meal at a very reasonable price wa excited to dine here until the host in the fedora wa extremely rude judgmental curt and unwelcoming maybe next time will be a better experience we left before finding out leaf much to be desired overpriced better jamaican food in the valley after getting reheated stake red bean and rice brought it to the owner attention he did nothing about it and had the audacity to charge me for the meal this restaurant may be good for folk who don t really know authentic west indian cuisine my gf say take me out for a rum drink i say your wish is my command n nbeautiful little restaurant open at downtown a very kind sir welcome u in i see the rum punch and i order up now this rum punch is delicious but i would have liked it to be stronger ya know punch i decided to add a shot to our drink with a haitian five star rum n nwe also had an app of cuban style pork tenderloin sandwich using fried plantain my gf enjoyed them i just am not crazy for plantain anyway cozy seating and we had a good time wow we finally found this place after mo of salivating and anticipating well let me tell you it wa well worth the wait we accidentally stumbled in after riding around on bike looking for a place with a byob policy sure am glad the sushi place next door had a not so friendly or inviting bartender otherwise we would have stayed and missed bread fruit we were the first to arrive so we had first choice which wa of course outside only problem with the outside dining is the chair with rounded leg on the grass which wa very shaky other than that everything else wa great we were riding around on bike and this wa the first stop so we went with a plethora of side and we were pleasantly surprised at the flavor and intricacy of each simple dish they looked so simple but tasted very true to the island i ve been to jamaica and have to say that i felt sa though i had been secretly flown back there without my knowledge only thing missin wa the ocean the simplest dish were the best and most tasty i mean it doesn t get any simpler than steamed cabage and pepper but hello tasty coconut after taste the dumpling were tasty too i loved the sauce had to try both and i devoured them the coleslaw wa my second fav very simple but filled with ton of flavor sa the night progressed about table top showed up so if i have to guess pm is a great time to go and be served fast yes you can take ur own wine not sure about beer since we were biking and didn t want to ride full i didn t do desert however next time im trying the pudding enjoy this hidden treasure i sure did both the meal and service were wonderful n nthe highlight were the hot buttered rum jerk chicken and the polenta wasn t a in love with the pound cake or jerk pork but they were still good n nyes the mango fish roll http www yelp com biz_photos the breadfruit phoenix select kklpgd aa bpvwdonaufyg kklpgd aa bpvwdonaufyg were definitely crispy and tasted delicious and yes the oven roasted plantain http www yelp com biz_photos the breadfruit phoenix select q jpbnwkko gme g w ta q jpbnwkko gme g w ta were firm on the outside and just like buttah on the inside but were they worth and plus tax respectively i don t think so i took photo of the food w a pen next to the plate to show you how small these portion were really for a small mango fish roll sliced three way and i m supposed to feel good about ordering an entree and dessert after n nthe sweet potato pudd n http www yelp com biz_photos the breadfruit phoenix select ghufceowcgwschxrw zmva ghufceowcgwschxrw zmva wa just absolutely fabulous but you won t catch me driving all the way to the breadfruit to spend my hard earned money here at least i know they ve reinvested some of the profit into remodeling the place it looked fifty time better than when it did on it first year of opening if you wish to dine and converse w your companion it s best not to come here on the weekend when next door rum bar is hopping then again maybe it wa just hopping on this night bec of the rum tasting event held there i haven t been back since so i don t know how busy these two business are i am giving the breadfruit star because i wa able to consume the food however it had zero flavor i started with the plantain and avocado spring roll i had curry tofu for my entree which wa served with rice and pea i usually not put salt on my food but unfortunately i had to ask for salt to add some flavor for dessert i had a sweet potato pudding which the server described a a cake like texture it wa closer to a pie non the positive side the sorrel drink wa good and vibe wa ok with jamaican music playing in the background we all decided on a whim at pm on a friday night to eat here because two member of our group recommended it with gusto nso it s friday night and we expected to walk straight in and find a table not exactly we just hoped that we would be able to get fed sometime before midnight we were very fortunate only to have to wait for about minute nwe were seated at an outside table perfect position a the weather wa mild and the area is filled with interesting people nthis restaurant focus well on two thing rum cocktail and authentic jamaican food they have both down to an art nwe were very fortunate to have a pair of waiter with style and a sense of humor i know that many waiter can get a reputation for being a little standoffish but our waiter seemed to actually enjoy what they were doing they turned a very good meal into a memorable experience nso why am i only giving this place four star i found two bone in my mackerel reduction a this wa a stew like dish i wa not expecting any bone and i wa very surprised when i pulled them out of my mouth expecting simply to find something vegetable based that wa a little tough nwe were tempted with dessert and even though the portion were small the taste wa enough to complement and complete the meal nthis place definitely deserves another visit review i will be back for the hot buttered rum cocktail for sure our group enjoyed a taste from the punch bowl and it wa quite delicious a pomegranate black cherry maple concoction wa served and i wa worried it might be too sweet but it packed a lot of flavor and a good punch haha sometimes a pre mixed drink special at restaurant are either too sweet watered down or possibly even too strong this one wa delightful n na couple in our group ordered a nd cocktail hot buttered rum i enjoyed a sip and it wa sooo good on the next chilly night downtown i will be back to partake a glass or two n ni learned you can also enjoy a cigar here and i have to say i don t recall the place wreaking of cigar smoke so that s a plus if you re worried about leaving with a cigar smoke smell on your clothes n ndrinks were a bit pricey but the quality of what i tasted wa great and i loved the ambiance dim lighting chill quiet perfect for a date night the best part of my experience here wa the capriana it wa sweet and delicious the server wa pretty good and very friendly n ni ordered the jerk prawn which cost and i received medium sized prawn on a skewer not only wa i disappointed in the lack of prawn they were terribly overdone very dry the flavoring wa pretty ok but couldn t make up for the dryness it also came with coleslaw grilled pineapple and corn and festival bread which wasn t bad i sampled my friend tropical salad which had yummy dressing and seemed more filling than my pricier meal n ni wa pretty hungry and i left the restaurant feeling like i needed to have a snack i don t mind small portion if the food is really good but this place just didn t have it n ni might consider coming back here for yummy drink but it s doubtful that would be enough motivation to bring me back in great food the patio is perfect drink are well made i am not a big rum drinker but absolutely loved the drink i tried loved the vibe n ni suggest the scallop and jerk chicken first visit and it exceeded review and expectation service wa top line menu filled with local quality ingredient we enjoyed shrimp and cauliflower cake small plate loved white fish and short rib both delicious but the short rib wa big winner rum drink were incredible i removed a star because their signature dessert wa literally one of the worst thing i ve ever tasted horrible way to end such a delicious meal i couldn t get the awful molasses taste out of my mouth and paid for that awfulness sad way to end an expensive yummy meal left a bad last impression my all time favorite restaurant in phoenix never a dull moment the owner run a very tight ship which i respect the staff is very keen on what it is they are serving the kitchen produce mouthwatering dish that excites with every bite and not to mention the cocktail sigh kudos to the owner you guy have a great thing going this is my second visit to the breadfruit the food is star but the restaurant is star i am deducting star for not having rum cake on the menu at a jamaican restaurant totally blow my mind i wa told that the desert is rotational and that today s desert wa carrot cake well we were here on saturday and carrot cake wa the desert i m taking a star away for a the service being a tad slow food is great taste authentic and is prepared with lot of love n nthe rum punch change daily the one i tried wa delicious excellent new in town for business and wa tired of mexican food being caribbean myself this wa nice to introduce to my friend who is hear on business a well those scallop were life all in itself rum wa perfect excellent service from javier the host and everyone else thank you again i will be back and i have already recommended that place to other colleague thank you javier we started at the bar with rum drink with amazing flavor the appetizer were complex and fantastic what a great night great service too the staff wa well trained and efficient for a restaurant in phoenix we felt like we were in ny or chicago a bit pricey but the curry veggie wa good and the mixed rum punch cocktail wa so yummy definitely would come back bf and his cousin enjoyed their food very much and said the salmon wa delicious i hated this place to put it mildly i don t eat meat and there wa only one vegetarian entree that wa not a salad on the menu when i ordered it the server told me they didn t have it tonight because they were out of one ingredient bok choy n nreally the chef can t get creative and substitute something in order for you prepare your only vegetarian option broccoli napa cabbage swiss chard celery collard green beet green or any number of other perfectly fine substitute would have worked or how about this radical approach have somebody run to the closest grocery store and pick up some fucking bok choy n nafter dinner we called for a cab to take u to our next destination the place wa not packed but the staff got shitty about u waiting at our table after we had spent a couple hundred buck the service overall wa pretty snobby n noh and they didn t have vodka i get that it s a rum bar but i just think any place with the word bar in the name should have a token bottle of vodka tequila or something for people who don t like rum i mean breadfruit carry over type of rum i think they could sacrifice a teeny bit of space for a couple of other spirit n noverall very disappointing my first time here and after the first drink before food arrived i already promised myself that i will be back savannah our server ha been fantastic extremely knowledgeable about the food and drink menu and very friendly she ha been very attentive even a the night ha gone on and the restaurant ha filled up we tried five thing on the menu and reordered one dish for a second time because it wa so good the mussel get them twice we were lucky to find this place online and already looking forward to my next visit it wa okay service wa efficient but not overly welcoming felt a little rushed the food wa alright nothing to go crazy about know that it s nothing like an authentic jamaican restaurant the fish cake were just okay too much dough for the amount of fish the rum glazed prawn were good and nicely spiced my curried goat lacked some kick and substance my favorite part wa the daily punch which had a nice spice to it without being overly sweet would come back but i have other place to try out i really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere here while we visited phoenix i had a delicious spicy goat over rice and started sampling my way through the crafted rum cocktail our server wa fantastic professional and really helped u find our way through the menu she wa able to suggest cocktail that fit our preference and really took great care of u after dinner we went out back for cigar on the patio i m not a cigar smoker but my boyfriend wa pleased with the selection we found some comfortable chair back there and eventually began chatting with the group on the neighboring couch while we enjoyed the mild phoenix night and interesting decor i can see myself coming back next time i m in phoenix oh my goodness wa this place good the drink were phenomenal the food wa so amazing and flavorful our server wa knowledgeable and did a great job i will definitely be returning i wanted to try this place so i got on their web page to look at the menu a menu with no price are they joking then i looked at the drink menu and again no price are they joking then i tried to email them and find there is no e mail are they joking the reservation system is a computer automated clunk that wasn t working i might still go a my friend want to but i have wasted all this time time i could have spent eating and i think somewhere else when a business make it this hard to give them my money i say pas for now wa excited to check this restaurant out but should have looked at yelp review first had a punch bowl which wa marginal at best tried the plantain appetizer which were lukewarm with no flavor wouldn t have been so bad if waiter didn t rave about our choice then the wait began for our entree minute later the jerk chicken and mussel we ordered still hadn t been delivered when we asked for our waiter he couldn t be found in the teeny tiny restaurant i went by the kitchen and wa told the chicken wasn t ready doe it really take minute for the chicken to get to temperature we decided to leave a the waiter or manager didn t bother to come speak to u good drink n ndecent food but not nearly great n noverpriced compared to what you receive n na lot of hype for what is honestly just an average place to eat n nnot so terrible that i wouldn t go back to try a new different entree but sure a heck wouldn t be the top of my list of place to go i liked breadfruit and the concept of caribbean food but the food is really healthy and is missing some jamaican flavor also the food take a really long time to come out i got the jerk chicken it wa a large dry chicken breast but it did have flavor my recommendation is try it if you want some food that is different just don t think you are eating true caribbean food appetizer were great main dish wa over priced and ordinary nwould go back for appetizer drink don t stay for dinner breadfruit and rum bar is one of my favorite restaurant bar in downtown phoenix their food is always great i can t find food like it anywhere else in the valley i strongly recommend to have the scallop best scallop i ve had before coming to rum bar thought i didn t like rum but the bartender helped me realize that rum is much more complex than just bacardi i ve been regularly coming to breadfruit and rum bar for about month now and they never disappoint the breadfruit a it is now make me sad sweet pea and i were early breadfruit adopter back when there weren t dozen of great restaurant downtown back when it wa a tiny place with no liquor license where you could byob sit with or so other people and watch one guy cook your dinner breadfruit ha changed a lot and not for the better n ni suggested breadfruit for dinner before an event because we hadn t been there in a year at least and sweet pea love the jerk chicken and i love the coconut curried tofu so we get there and like separate people asked u if we have a reservation it hadn t even occurred to me to make a reservation for pm even on a saturday night but the place wa full after they told u that it will either be an hour for a table or we can sit at the bar we decided to sit at the bar since our event started at pm and i generally don t mind eating at the bar anyway unfortunately we ended up with me sitting on the end by the service well so it wa sub optimal also when i picked up the drink menu there wa a dead moth underneath that i had to brush away n nthe bartender poured u some water and asked u if we ve been there and we said yes then sweet pea ordered a dark and stormy which is a very typical rum drink this being a rum bar and all the bartender say uh we like to keep it on menu have you been here before awkward no we were lying we explained that we had but that it had been awhile and then we felt like crap after all the do you have reservation inquiry and now this we felt unwelcome and out of place rearding the dark and stormy ever since they opened rum bar they ve been all uppity about their rum drink menu i have been there and tried to order a rum and diet and been smacked down hard because g d forbid they serve such a pollutant a diet coke with their beloved rum whatever but a dark and stormy is a classic rum cocktail the best they could offer sweet pea if he like dark and stormys wa a mojito which is nothing like a dark and stormy he got it and i tasted it and honestly it may be the best mojito i ve ever had but still i tried to order an iced tea but they didn t have that either i considered sparkling water but noticed it listed on the beverage menu like all the rum with it country of origin mexico and decided against it n nwe ordered the plantain avocado spring roll to split then sweet pea tried to order the jerk chicken which ha to be most people main reason to go to a jamaican restaurant but they told him they don t have it although it s on the menu what they did offer instead wa a half chicken something or other which is not on the menu but is more and doesn t even have jerk spice he decided to order the jerk pork and polenta instead n nthe spring roll were pretty pedestrian and small at roll split in half for and it just made u miss the patty they used to have they gave u a palate cleanser in between course which wa unnecessary but speaks to what this place now envisions itself a having become my tofu wa the same a always good and sweet pea did really like his jerk pork but we both miss the old breadfruit and with all of the restaurant that we now have downtown we will most likely not be coming back it s a shame the breadfruit is wonderful place to eat healthy yummy food just came from there with a friend we shared the kiwi pineapple drink and carrot coconut milk drink both were awesome though we preferred the carrot then we shared the escovitch fish heavenly jerk chicken best i ve ever had and the ital sampler which i would skip in the future a it wa just meh the plantain were pretty good not the best ever i liked how fresh everything tasted especially the coleslaw the food is a bit spicy which i like i can t wait to go back and save room for dessert group of dined at the breadfruit on a friday night i had initially made reservation for at but then when another couple wanted to join u open table would no longer let me edit our reservation so i called to change the number dining however no one there answered the phone at pm and their voicemail say do not leave a voicemail umm okay anyway so we get there at pm and they are able to modify our reservation for u even though they were completely packed per the host they could seat u at the table the sat u at wa actually empty the minute we were waiting so not sure why we couldn t be sat right away n ntable ordered drink the rum punch is extremely delicious and is made fresh and different every day table also tried multiple other drink and all were great if you are willing to wait min per cocktail we even tried ordering our next drink while our original wa nearly full hoping to make up for the extremely long cocktail wait but we still would wait forever with empty drink in front of u n nappetizers that were ordered came out quick and were tasty however our actual meal took nearly an hour and half so if you are in any sort of rush i do not recommend this place our server wa nice and tried and i do not feel our incredibly long wait were anything in his control but the kitchen and bar need to get their act together n nthe host there is also incredibly rude a stated he wa able to modify the reservation but made it a big deal first and acted like we were causing a huge inconvenience to his night my husband went in to use the restroom and wa accused of not actually being a customer there even though this is the same guy that sat u and we had been on the patio waiting forever not really a great way to treat your customer who are pretty irritated to begin with simply the best jerk chicken i have ever had i sat at the bar which could use some acoustic management but the staff wa great drink were wonderful but expensive i did feel i got my money worth i will be going back this place wa amazing great staff we have scallop a an app and then prawn for meal both were amazing food wa great we had the jerk chicken pork and polenta and lamb everything wa very good except for service bartender were short and rude and not very welcoming server wa very unpleasant and seemed very unhappy and impatient we will not be back only had drink the drink menu wa extensive and the drink were delicious service wa very slow will likely return to try the food had the fourty six food is bland small portion not authentic and very overpriced would absolutely not recommend going here for a meal service wa good though nice ambience didn t get drink so can t comment on that might be a good place to go for just drink though based on other review loved the beautifully curated drink the ambience wa perfect and the pepper shrimp lived up to it promise of being super spicy i love this place their chutney dish is absolutely amazing though i have gotten a pie there once before which wa terrible most of their food is great it s very small but doe offer outside seating which is great during the month or two when it s nice outside i generally dislike seafood but i fell in love with caribbean food during my honeymoon in the bahamas the flavor were so wonderful and the quality and freshness of the ingredient so much different than i had grown up with that it truly changed my perspective i still may not clamor for seafood and still greatly prefer milder fish to the more robust and fishier option but i appreciate fresh seafood when i can get it n nimagine my surprise then when i discovered not only fantastic fresh seafood in the middle of downtown but also a restaurant that brought the flavor of my honeymoon rushing back breadfruit pleased from the get go when my wife and i ate there recently n none of the seafood i like least is scallop a fact i am coming to accept is because they are typically frozen and overcooked to a displeasing rubbery texture i have only ever eaten scallop at one restaurant moto that were good still my wife love scallop and i love jerk flavor so we ordered the appleton rum sea scallop which are covered in a jerk rub suffice to say i now have eaten two scallop dish i love the jerk seasoning wa wonderfully spicy and the scallop were perfectly seared and cooked until they were just translucent in the center they were soft enough to cut with a fork and practically melted in your mouth n nfor dinner i had the escovitch fish which wa atlantic red snapper on the day we dined red snapper is a fish i discovered in the bahamas and this dish reminded me how good it can be the filet wa cooked perfectly and the escovitch sauce essentially a spicy vinegar mixture wa quite good a were the pickled vegetable that accompanied it n nafter much deliberation my wife chose the brown stew chicken which while complexly flavored wa quite dry and overcooked which wa a shame her dish wa the one blemish on our meal but the rest of the food wa so good and the untried item on the menu so appetizing that we will definitely return n nalso a note the portion are small but this is an upscale caribbean restaurant where the focus is much more on quality over quantity the food is good but way overpriced nthe service is awful i have been on three separate occasion and each time i end up leaving angry that the waitstaff or owner ha somehow managed to insult me n nfor the money i would much rather go somewhere nicer one of the best place in the valley to get a cocktail these guy are going on my rapidly expanding pissed at myself for not checking out sooner list i m not a rum drinker but fortunately they have plenty of non rum drink n ni started with devil in a blue dress which wa neither sweet nor bitter not my favorite drink but not for lack of skill on the bartender s part i moved on to kiwi reserve which wa much more my style and did have mt gay a one of the ingredient n nrum bar is very classy and low key and the bartender are true mixologist with knowledge on par with a chemist they know their shit and they take their craft seriously which is apparent in every stage of the drink preparation n nthis is a nice relaxing place to come relax and in casual yet sophisticated environment and i can t wait to come back n nhighly recommend came in from california for a few day and this place wa an amazing find we had three drink and they were all excellent my favorite wa probably the punch which wa just all orange bitter orange juice and rum bitbit change every day so ask first another excellent drink wa the sugarfoot a little bit sweet but great a a second drink and then we looked at the other review and got the rum old fashioned stronger and to the point got the baked plantain which come with mango chutney and cinnamon highly recommend them nthe service wa just great our server isaac wa friendly and fun to talk with sitting on the front porch with reggae playing softly and we just started drifting off to the carribean i thought this place wa a bit of a let down i really enjoyed the rum punch however breadfruit wa the perfect place to have my birthday dinner although it s a bit small they accommodated our party of the food is something to rave about with the browned chicken stew that us few ingredient but key ingredient in making a good dish i e ginger spice etc my friend had the chicken and dumpling which she could take it or leave it since the wheat dumpling were dense however the jerk chicken wa described a very good it included a juicy and tender piece of chicken and the right combination of corn plantain and pineapple they advertise using fresh local ingredient and you can tell with the vegetable that were perfectly cooked crispy another friend ordered the curried tofu which wa full of flavor and a dish that i am going to try next time n noverall breadfruit ha great food excellent price for the quality of food fun selection of non alcoholic beverage and a byob option i will come back and see you again where have you been all my life we only stopped in for drink but they were yummy gabby wa able to recommend wonderful drink based on our preference and she wa very attentive to our table i can t wait to come back to try your food choice okay and some more of those delicious cocktail quaint relaxing bar in downtown phoenix attached to the breadfruit you better like rum though option are quite limited if you don t i tried the special punch of the day and it wa delicious but they had me at strawberry ok i came here with my fellow c after a yelp event so not the best idea n ni had already a princess treat at yelp event so to try a so so piña colada wa not the best but we got a rectification of our experience with the avocado plantain starter this is a weird delicious tasty mix for an appetizer they mix it with a mango sauce that despite your mind say no your mouth say yes n nafter this and trying another creation my friend order it is worth to consider to come back and try it with a clean mind few place i ve been to around the country catch my attention enough to warrant a review even more rare is a star read the below star they pretty say everything i wanted say i run a very reputable bar and restaurant myself and breadfruit is what i aspire to have someday simply put it hand down the best place to eat and drink in phoenix you must sit at the bar though in year and ten of thousand of dollar spent on various meal and drink at hundred of place this is my go to and favorite place meh n noverpriced psuedo urban hoity toity experience n nshould you come here at least once and try some house cocktail for each sure why not n nbut is this a place to frequent not at all well except phony phony will love this place holden however would hate it i have never been more impressed with the attention to detail dwayne and his wife put into the entire menu from the time you watch sarah mix your first drink you will realize this place is carefully thought out and time and effort is spent creating a jamacian experience that is authentic and delicious eat and drink your way through the menu and you will be amazed the color scheme and music representative of jamaica is amazing don t look for goat and only twice a month do you find oxtail stew but trust me na dissayah sinting a fee real nfor those of you for whom patois is not your first language please note the following you will feel like you are very much in an authentic jamaican environment minus the accent this place is cute and trendy i have one complaint really and that ha to do with the value of the meal i ordered jerk chicken and literally ate a piece of chicken breast and paid about when i add the sweet potato pudding and sorrell no alcohol yes that mean i wa sober when i paid for that bit of protein nso if you really want some good jamaican knosh make friend with some real jamaican mon ni also have to say that if you turn up early even five minute early they will make you sweat it out in the hot arizona sun i am not sure why they dont let you wait inside but again now you know nbe careful to find a place that is safe to park at i parked behind the establishment after making sure that the space wa kosher because there is a movement in the area to ticket a many people a it take to buy a meal at breadfruit whew after month of being on the road going to the rum bar downtown for the promise of a perfect caribbean night is exactly what a gal need to feel right at home n nwhen i entered the bar the vibe wa really friendly and welcoming so i can tell right off the bat that i d enjoy the night ahead i started with the dark stormy a generous and sweet concoction of ginger beer and rum with a trail of mojitos the seafood wa divine a well i tried out the mediterranean mussel and the spicy rum glazed shrimp that had me racing for another round of mojitos just to wash it down a must try a nice change from hipster food authentic meal and awesome drink menu do not let the rum menu scare you some of the best shrimp in the valley ha a kick but worth the heat usually when you make reservation you expect to get in quicker but when we arrived of our party of were delayed in traffic imagine our surprise consternation when we were told we would not be seated until everyone wa there the of u could have been ordering drink enjoying appetizer oh well while waiting outside i observed quite a few people similarly waiting and many empty table which didn t make sense to me so first off plan on being a tad irritated by the time you get to your table this would seem to be a major problem but in spite of all the review complaining of this bottleneck problem it continues n ni liked my meal but in my defense i must say i have never had jamaican cuisine before still i enjoyed it everyone at our table wa happy with their food but it wa a bit pricey and it wa very noisy at our table conversation wa almost impossible i don t know how that would work with that intimate scenario they are trying to create n nour waiter wa excellent but he failed to mention the automatic gratuity added to all bill for party of or more seems like he should have of course that might have cut back on his evening haul n nall in all it wa not such a relaxing evening when i think of jamaica i sure don t think of rigid rule and an unbending attitude toward life s little bump and the phrase don t worry be happy never came to mind this wa a great place three of u tried of the appetizer especially loved the fish pastry had the jerk chicken the scallop and the escovitch fish enjoyed several of the rum neat and on the rock still love the zaya the best cute quaint relaxing on a tuesday night met and talked with the chef delightful place will definitely return for more hour long wait for food some of the menu item are a hit or miss this is not your authentic caribbean restaurant beautiful venue so we walk in and ask to sit on the patio in one of the open table they say no the patio is only for group of then they ask u if we have a reservation we say no and they ask u to wait to be seated even though the whole place wa practically empty n nthen we get the menu and order mojitos the mojitos were small for but they had real spearmint good because the tap water tasted bad so i used it for my water which trust me you will need with the food n nthen we try to order but jerk option were unavailable and one pork chop option wa replaced with quail so we go for the scallop appetizer the shredded pork jerk and the coconut curry n nwe asked for some bread while we waited they do a garlic bread appetizer not good the wait bothered my date a little because they served the people who walked in after u right away i didn t like that it wa super freezing inside and really loud so i couldn t hear the waiter bad acoustic we managed to have some loud but good conversation over mojitos and convinced them to light our tea light for warmth comic relief n nthey play a lot of bob marley to make up for the bad acoustic otherwise we would definitely hear word for word everything being said n neventually food came it wa presented really well but not easy to eat the scallop caused a histamine reaction right away for me not sure if it wa the sauce maybe liquid smoke i m not allergic to sea food they serve a really cute palate cleanse in between course n n i had trouble with the curry dish item cabbage didn t lend itself to be cut or a finger food the tofu wa a change of pace sauce wa mild rice super bland and tiny bit of candied plantain were super good n ni tried my date s sweet potato side and that wa pretty mellow but my date got an upset stomach later had some pepto bismouth and his tongue turned scary black from the reaction of all the charcoal in the food and the bismouth in response to comment on this post we are aware bismouth can cause this reaction alone but it had not happened before the goal is to not need pepto bismouth after dinner n nwe had a nice time anyway that s how we roll but it wa for both of u with tip and it just didn t seem worth it it s like they re trying to be something in l a or nyc no sf restaurant would act so pompous about seating although i did appreciate the local sourced food their desert sounded fantastic so if i go back it will just be for desert i m with tracy i really like this place the layout is clean and simple the atmosphere super chilled the food fresh and tasty whenever i have business meeting at lunch i bring people to independent downtown eatery i feel it my duty to show them that our city is starting to bloom and everyone i have brought dug the food and the vibe n nbut the most important thing the owner dwayne is super friendly keen to hear feedback and eager to make his new restaurant work n nthat s a whole kind of refreshing in itself rum bar stand a one of the few place that transport you in term of a cocktail lounge i still have not found a place downtown that rival the way in which rum bar focus on it handcrafted cocktail and creating an atmosphere that is seductively easy to find yourself chatting with other patron while also ruminating on your own thought n ni had really written off rum in term of my imbibing repertoire because it often is done too saccharinely sweet and violently colored meant to get club drunk rum bar wiped this away the progression of drink and their sophistication in term of flavor profile and what they do to showcase the sheer diversity and variety of rum is uncanny and intoxicating the bartender literally pull you into an experience that allows you to feel for a your short stint sipping that you might actually be shacked up in the caribbean n nin order to indulge in this experience it doe demand that you spend more per cocktail but the quality is unparalleled that s why i suggest swinging by this place between pm to snag the happy hour remember the entire establishment creates intimacy and for that reason it easily get filled fast and is better for not too large party rolling through for the richness of rum reservation are key on busier night and the small patio help to only further the caribbean vibe n nalso not particularly a problem for me and actually a plus is the fact that for az it doe have a dress code personally if you think you can wear a ripped muscle tee to an elevated boozing establishment you might be a little ridiculous to begin with aka no post gym fake post gym active wear sporting if you want a more casual atmosphere this would not be the choice for you it is carefree inducing but not casual by any mean and therefore demand that you have to deal with some of the hangups and restriction that come with this type of cocktail cruising i really love this place the craft cocktail are all wonderful it s hard to hold yourself back when you want to try them all a the name implies they only serve rum based drink but the amount of thought that go into every ingredient they add really make them all shine speaking of rum if you re used to malibu captain morgan s and bacardi you re going to be surprised that there s a whole other world of amazing rum not like anything you find in a typical grocery store if you don t like rum you haven t been to rum bar the food is also really tasty most of it is pretty carb heavy but i ll break my diet to come here the jerk chicken is spicy and flavorful and if you re looking to splurge the lobster is excellent i try to come here at least once a week this wa a lovely unique dining experience food wa delicious and the staff wa extremely attentive the ambiance wa quaint and inviting we went on a date night there but would recommend for any experience if rum is your jam this is your spot extensive specially rum drink menu all paired with the dish what a fun restaurant loved the big window with the candle the plantain were super good so wa the spring roll with mango chutney our server wa very friendly and recommended the curry chicken tofu which wa a big hit highly recommend the hibiscus tea delicious a beer a piña colada a pre made punch cold scallop and a bowl of soup for you be the judge i am laid back guy and don t sweat the small stuff i took my wife here for her birthday along with party of other folk while at the bar attempting to order a drink the party wa seated the bartender sam and african american host were so rude i did not order a drink and instead went to the table to order upon arriving there come to find out others at the table were complaining about how poorly they were being treated fyi rum there but no one know how to make a drink they said they knew how to make rum and coke and i could have that if i wanted so ridiculous it s funny we couldn t wait to get our tab and go somewhere without the overpowering negative energy food is tasty but the bar is where it at best drink and bartender in town the breadfruit star we ve dined here four time now the quality of the food is all over the place but usually settle on just being ok small portion for the price too i find the service staff to be uppity bordering on condescending i ve always walked away still hungry and unsatisfied i won t be dining there again nrum bar star rum bar is in a different universe the bartending staff ha always been friendly and helpful amazing selection of rum and imaginative cocktail oh yeah this place is unlike any other the absolute best rum drink in the city when you hear rum bar don t think rum runner on spring break think about where don draper would want a glass of rum if he wa in the caribbean nthe food his high quality jamaican the jerk sauce is so spicy and so good great place to take a date or a friend from out of town they also have cigar you can buy and smoke on the back patio if you re in to that sort of thing my husband jamaican and i were very excited to try the breadfruit especially after reading so many rave review sadly the best part of our experience and meal wa the drink which turn this review into a star instead of n neven with a half empty dining room at pm on a weekday we were told they did not have a table available and had to wait half an hour at which point we were escorted into the now near empty dining room n nour appetizer and entree were bland with only hint of jamaican flavor and served luke warm hubby had a upset stomach and touch of queasiness a couple hour after dinner n nthe concept of the restaurant is great but i recommend anyone visiting the breadfruit should go for happy hour and get the rum punch or other tasty cocktail and skip the food then you might not be disappointed i really wanted to like this place nwe arrived about minute earlier than our friend and we waited about min to be seated in an empty place n nfirst we were greeted by a pretentious host who tried so hard to make it seem a this place wa the most chic and expensive restaurant in new york city haha nope nwe asked to be seated on the front patio since it wa empty and it wa super nice out he quickly responded in a condescending way no patio is only reserved for dining are you dining i wa already over this place at this point n nonce the host decided enough time had passed he came and took u to the back patio which is the smoker section we were not smoking we wanted to have a few drink in a non smoking section but i guess here you don t get the option anyway it worked out after all since the place wa empty n nthe host back here wa nice and he did an ok job but we asked to get a few drink and an appetizer and we were told we are not allowed to serve food back here i wa already over the pretentious attitude of this place and now i wa over all the rule they had nwe order drink all the same and they only brought lol i mean this place wa empty how can you forget drink out of n nthe drink were meh the pretentious service wa meh and the tacky uncomfortable patio set wa meh this could be an amazing place if they would only stop pretending this is fine dining get rid of your host upfront and all your rule focus on making people comfortable and welcomed so they want to come back n ni will never be back here again so please don t waste your precious time and money we drank our meh drink payed our bill and took our party to bliss rebar now this place wa amazing drink were great food is great and the service is frendly and welcoming boom that s what you want a a review so i wound up at the breadfruit with the yelp az international supper club my st time and glad i went look forward to many other eating adventure to come on a thursday night st off how come no one ha written about the parking i m from chandler and don t go downtown that often and didn t bring change with me for the parking meter so wound up in a parking lot not too far from the restaurant and paid buck for le than hour oh well i m putting it out their now bring change to feed the meter n ni have mixed feeling on the breadfruit and i ll explain the food which wa good i enjoyed it and did eat it i think is little overpriced for example the pineapple upsidedown cake i order that wa maybe bite wa that wa more than my pina colada come on now maybe they want you to drink to forget the price lol also people were saying the size of the entrée dish were small but for me it wa perfect i think it s because we are so used to our plate being full of food that we forget what the right portion of food is but because of the price i am rating it star for now n nthere were mussel for everyone to enjoy and if you are seafood person i bet they would have been for you i did try one the broth wa delish the flavor omg so good the only thing that ruined it for me wa the mussel but that s because i don t care for seafood so don t listen this part of my review haha n nmy friend and i ordered the plantain avocado spring roll which were avocado ripe plantain baked in a wanton wrap paired with house mango chutney ok if you never had an avocado cooked then it would throw your taste bud for loop but for me this little appetizer wa good and the mango chutney wa a perfect paring didn t disappoint n ni ordered the jerk chicken off the grill i have been craving jerk chicken forever and this came with a slaw of sort mango chutney grilled pineapple and a corn on the cobb that tasted like it wa glazed in coconut omg so good i wish all corn on the cobb wa like that the jerk chicken had great flavor and kick my taste bud were jumping i cut up a little piece and paired it with a piece of grilled pineapple mango chutney and it wa party time like eye rolling back good man that wa great the little bread stick wa a nice treat too little bit on the sweet side enjoyed it that wa a perfect dish i would come back for that n nok so i wound up ordering desert which is something i rarely do but i wa sold on the description of pineapple upside cake i love that stuff well i had high hope for this cake it wa a very small portion and it came with a steep price of if it wa everything that had been described to me i think i would have been ok with the price but the cake wa dry not a moist a i like it it had few pineapple on it and the glazed wa only on the corner of the cake but that glazed wa good i just wanted it to be more than what it wa i think next time i will skip the desert and order another drink haha n nglad to have found the breadfruit and i bet i will be coming back for that jerk chicken soon i popped in here after walking around downtown and the smell wa amazing i wa already hungry walking in but the smell practically had me foaming at the mouth n ni sat down had a drink non alcoholic because it wa a work day in minute and my food arrived minute later the server wa super friendly with lot of suggestion tip she recommended a dish and i had the fish specialty escoviche it wa super i got the impression that the jerk chicken is very spicy but with this dish the eater me can control the heat since it s served with chile and chile oil on the side i ended up going all in with the chile yum city n ni definitely want to go back and try some of the spicier food have a cocktail a well it seemed like they have a small but great selection of fresh juice and tasty rum to go well with the cuisine n na a side note for anyone looking to go here it s in a great little spot of phx surrounded by other restaurant and it is close to the light rail for the lucky few who happen to live off that awesome mile stretch of public transportation if you go note that the place is tiny it seat maybe people top but i think that quaintness add to it charm love the drink you can t find in your typical bar unique aromatic full of flavor and you get money worth highly recommend i had the tamarind delish wow i am so glad that i found this place the food wa amazing we got the ceviche and the rainbow trout totally had the perfect amount of spice and flavor the rum punch of the day wa also tasty a newbie to this neighborhood we will be back shout out to gabby our wonderful waitress who helped u through the drink and dinner menu if you want an experience that includes both food and drink pairing this is a winner this place wa more than i could ve expected we visited this place during a visit to phx it wa great from start to finish the service wa great the server made all of the right recommendation drink superb food great and the rum cake exploded with flavor in my mouth i will visit this place when i return word brown stew chicken i m a huge fan of jamaican food having a really good friend from the island that spoil me with authentic recipe that have passed down through generation in his family and traveling all over the world my palette is internationally known lol n nback to the story needle to say my taste bud were going crazy with expectation well dannng my girlfriend and i stood at the podium long enough to pull up yelp and read several mixed review since we had been noticed yet no one wa coming over to greet u we started toward the empty bar with one guy seated and a totally empty lounge area when we noticed the sign please wait for server to be seared including the bar so we waited and waited and waited until someone anyone would make eye contact with u finally a waitress approached u and asked if we have a reservation i snickered like really my girlfriend said no we do not and she stated it would be a wait haha okaaaay so we waited only shortly though n nonce at the table we began browsing the drink menu in search of the jamaican rum wray nephew which they did so cool now a for the menu we both noticed the absence of jerk wing hmm we thought maybe we ll ask our server the server approached our table with a mouthful of the day s special selection and a great grasp of the menu very impressive so we ordered admiral s punch and some starter she had the roasted plantain with chutney dip and i had the baked mango fish roll the plantain were soft not crisp and void of flavor a for my fish roll they were pretty good but the fish wa over cooked the drink were a bit weak until we added shot of wray nephew n nso a we sat sipping a man stopped by our table and asked if we were enjoying our food we looked at each other and she asked why jerk wing weren t served on the starter menu the islander became very defensive explaining his island eats the whole bird not just part of it my girlfriend rebutted having spent a lot of time in jamaica feasting on local island cuisine a well a falling in love with the jerk wing wellll this stuck a nerve and to be quite honest i don t think he wa expecting a real reply to his question just pretending to care n nneedless to say in life you meet some people that try so hard to upscale their image that they lose the true essence of their identity oh and he wa rude because he kept wanting to rush off a if the place wa packed lol n nwarning the only people that would be impressed by the food are those that have never truly experienced real jamaican cuisine and to think their philosophy our philosophy is that good food should be good to eat my point exactly nin case you re wondering the one star wa for having actual jamaican rum had lunch here had the mango tea w mint fried plantain appetizer scallop appetizer and shrimp appetizer it wa all very tasty the mango tea wa excellent though the plantain were cooked perfectly with a little crisp on the edge and a little soft from grease in the middle the scallop were huge and tasted like there were fresh not frozen i didn t care for the shrimp and the pea they were ok just didn t do it for me there were some banana bread stick that were included also a little rubbery but the flavor wa dead on i d go back for dinner i appreciate the owner for taking a gamble on downtown phoenix and opening in a city where charm is a rare a good driver the entree are generally tasty and reasonably priced for example i have thoroughly enjoyed my jerk chicken both time that i have dined here similarly my dining partner have found their prawn and beef stew satisfactory n nthe intimate dining room with exposed brick lends a casual and laid back atmosphere service is attentive water glass are always kept full and waitress are very knowledgeable about the small menu n nso why did i not provide a fourth star two word dessert disaster i ordered the sweet potato pudding dessert and wa presented with a slice of pudding that wa about a wide and tall a two of my finger and i m not a giant perhaps i could forgive the size if it were especially decadent but it wa dry and not especially flavorful paying for a mediocre sliver of sweet potato pudding hurt me in the value department especially considering that my large entree itself wa under n nin general this restaurant ha a lot going for it however the food seems to be the issue that is leading most reviewer myself included to not rate it a highly a we would hope we could if the owner is reading this review i suggest he or she consider making some minor revision to the menu a restaurant cannot survive if it is only respected for it charming building or place the quality and value of the food must equal the surroundings in it ability to satisfy customer classic mojito plantain and avocado spring roll fred s jerk chicken sandwich french press coffee shared with sweet potato pie a la mode plus exemplary service with a smile by holly n ncozy den perfect for a date or just catching up with a friend my partner in crime and i shot the crap for hour and never once were we given any indication that it wa anything le than completely cool n nthat s how you do it breadfruit good on you n nside note i don t even particularly like rum phoenix need more restaurant in downtown and preferably more like the breadfruit n nthe food wa innovative and fresh and the staff wa helpful and gracious our first course wa the jerk scallop and they were delicious for my main course i had the chicken in a dark caribbean sauce and it wa amazing my friend had the mussel and he loved them n nnow let talk about the drink actually just have some and talk later i would suggest asking your waiter or waitress for a full review they will not steer you wrong n nthe next time i m in phoenix i will visit the breadfruit perfection so i wa really excited to check out this place when i visited phoenix at the end of july went straight there from the airport love the swanky hole in the wall that phoenix seems to have a niche in our server wa very nice and the drink were great but now the disappointment begin appleton rum sea scallop app wa pretty good couls have used more flavor but what s awful wa there were only and our food took forever not worth it they should definitely change this into a main dish add scallop more seasoning rice and increase the price to make it worth it i ordered the pork with polenta and it wa boring my friend ordered something else dont remember what but she wasn t thrilled either so i recommend this place maybe for a happy hour but for dinner s there is better out there if you re looking for carribean food downtown i suggest ticoz such a regret the host treated u a were an unconvinced to this restaurant negative behavior from all the staff and restriction all the way my friend group of walked to the bar and asked for a drink the host moved u to the patio because we didn t had a reservation we were the only one at the patio and it took min for a waitress to come out and take our order awesome this little quaint place wa right up our alley fresh cocktail and a delicious food the jerk chicken never disappoints but the service kitchen is kind of slow nalso tried the curry coconut tofu dish flavor wa good but the tofu wa a strange texture a friend ordered the pork belly and unfortunately they were out so she had the jerk pork and wa pleased a well each time i have been there they have been out of at least one dish which is unfortunate ndespite the service and them running out of certain dish i will continue to patronize the place because i think the food is really good i had a friend another jamaican with a couple of hour layover in phoenix so i picked him up and headed to this restaurant a it seemed the closest to the airport the staff wa very friendly and we didn t have to wait too long for service i have to admit this small establishment wa just about on of the fanciest of the jamaican restaurant i have visited in north america this doesn t usually bode well with me because from my personal experience the fancier the restaurant the more they stray from the authenticity of the cuisine by trying to please the american palate nwe eschewed the nouvelle cuisine menu item obvious there to please that crowd and ordered the escovitch fish and jerk chicken since my favourite ox tail wa nowhere on the menu and that is the dish most jamaican use to test the excellence of our restaurant i guess it doesn t ring well in a fancy place anyway a a kingstonian i am used to going to a beach area where they cook up the best escovitch fish corned with country pepper habanero and onion and dripping with grease but just finger licking good that wa not the case here but it wa a darn righ better that i could have whipped up in my kitchen at home i think most american will probably enjoy it but i will wait until i am back home or at a greasy spoon in brooklyn or one of the many florida city with large jamaican community the jerk chicken wa also nothing like you would get back home but exotic enough for vacationer to the island needing a bit of nostalgia the rice and pea wa missing something i am not sure what exactly but suspect it didn t have any coconut milk or not enough anyway i have other jamaican friend who have enjoyed other dish here so i have not given up yet and plan to return and sample a few other dish i have been craving breadfruit roast or friend so i hope i wont be disappointed went to dinner here with some girlfriend during a weekend reunion in phoenix we started off with some delicious rum drink at the bar while waiting the minute for a table i had a great dark stormy n nthe coconut curried tofu with rice ripe plantain and veggie wa fabulous but there were only a few plantain per plate n nif you wish to converse it s best not to go on the weekend when the rum bar is busy n noverall this is an intimate great bar and restaurant the drink are strong the decor is wonderful the food is great and the serve is prompt ugh nwaitress wa not terribly flexible with food and drink order ni asked for a mojito with le simple syrup and she said the mix is already made with syrup ni asked the bartender separately and he said ok no problem ni asked for the modified mojito nshe stated that the bartender misunderstood me nit s a f ing bar napparently the drink menu is fixed nno mixology at this place more like fixedology n nif hungry do not order the lamb chop the portion of two tiny chop wa just silly n nhopefully management read this and make change if i could review the drink separately from the food i would give the rum bar star the drink and the myriad of rum choice are awesome i think they have something like variety of rum yum plus i love me some island like drink however seeing that i can t review one without the other i have to give rum bar only star due to the food which is bleh at best n ni should probably add my disclaimer now i am from the bronx ny and have been eating authentic jamaican food my entire life so my expectation may be a bit higher than someone whose never really had the real deal now that that s done on to my review n ni tried the breadfruit when it first opened up a few year ago and wasn t impressed with the food then their beef patty wa this square shaped thing that wa nothing like the true beef patty that i get from the jamaican bakery when i m at home in the bronx i can t even remember what else i had which speaks to the memorability of this food soooooo fast forward to october my girlfriend had a birthday gathering at the rum bar which is how i ended up there i wa mainly drinking and only wanted a little something to have on my stomach you true drinker know what i mean so i just got an order of plantain and even those were on the dry side like they had been overcooked a bit n ni will definitely hit up the rum bar again for the cocktail but i ll make i sure i eat before i go this place ha potential good ambience and location adorable bathroom sink but our waitress wa rude condescending and the drink were over priced i tried this place out for the first time with a party of seven this last first friday the food wa to die for if you don t like spicy food you should tell them but i got the jerk chicken and it wa perfectly cooked and amazingly seasoned my friend got the scallop and they were probably the best i ve had in phoenix we had to wait a while for our table not surprised since we had a large group and it wa friday night but they had a a live band playing in the back a great seating area to wait in and a great drink list even though i don t really like rum i will definitely be coming back honestly i love the food and drink but i m beyond tired of the rude hostess and server that i ve encountered on several occasion the breadfruit ha a great decor and location and is a perfect spot for tasty cocktail but if you are looking for dinner the breadfrult is a disappointment a others have noted there is no host of any kind so even with a reservation you stand around awkwardly waiting to be seated by someone the food ha good spice but i found dish way too sweet and portion are astoundingly tiny on the whole the jerk chicken wa the exception tasty and well proportioned with tasty bean and rice i hope they work on the hosting and tweak the menu a bit because the decor is lovely and you can tell the place is a labor of love i think breadfruit is a wonderful little jamaican restaraunt the dish are unique and wondefully flavorful the place is small but that just add to the air of intimacy the kitchen is close and within view the wait staff is extremely knowledgable friendly and ready with a great and candid assesment of what s great on the menu that day and what s not the cocunut carrot juice drink are absolutely amazing i think this spot is best a an off downtown lunch spot a it can get pretty crowed and hence uncomfortable during week end evening i definitely give it an enthusiastic recommendation and am certain you will love the food every aspect of dining is worth the cost the service food and ambiance are all wonderful my favorite include the jerked scallop with sautéed veggie and the mussel i also love the carrot juice and the coffee the breadfruit is a great place for special occasion the fact that this restaurant and golden corral both get the same rating a a crime against humanity this restaurant is rather small amazing selection of rum the swordfish is fantastic the jerk pork is incredible the shrimp are amazing i ve never had anything there that i didn t love except maybe dessert but i m not big i dessert the wait staff is terrific it s a fun environment if you have not been to this restaurant i strongly recommend it if i lived in phoenix i go every week the place seems to be getting a devoted crowd so call ahead for reservation if you do enjoy rum the rum flight are fantastic and give you a chance to try thing that you probably would never try any other way i wish i could rate our server separately because she wa amazing and deserves star drink were fantastic without a doubt however the entire experience wa disappointing there seems to be an air of impatience and annoyance at customer coming from most of the staff especially from a gentleman who i believe wa managing i am writing this review because i just can t believe how poor our overall experience wa definitely won t be investing my time and money coming back to this place if you want to impress a date this is the place to start the ambiance is classy and yet cozy we indulged once upon a night and had the hot buttered rum a well a other creative run cocktail n nthe food is excellent but what really made me comfortable wa the service our server wa knowledgable attentive and professional i liked that he wasn t interrupting our conversation and asking every minute if everything wa ok or if we needed a refill so many restaurant make it difficult to enjoy a peaceful evening with constant interruption n nwe will definitely return last night i went with a group of friend for our yelp international supper club meeting the breadfruit truly doe transport one to the beach of jamaica the atmosphere is very intimate and relaxed with soft music playing in the background and little white candle lining the window frame for appetizer i had the plantain avocado spring roll and the pimento wood smoked mussel the roll paired really well with the mango chutney that they were paired with but the texture inside the roll wa a little too mushy for me the roll itself wa crunchy but i wish there wa some type of nut inside to break the monotony i couldn t resist ordering a mai tai which wa absolutely delicious my entrée wa the red stripe curried prawn the prawn were in fact amazing and served with rice bean plantain and bell pepper for dessert i had the pineapple upside down cake but the only thing that wa upside down wa my smile when i tasted this tiny dry sad excuse of a dessert for i expected that dessert to knock off my heel and round out a fantastic food evening some thing to note they will not split bill nightmare for a party of parking is either by meter or pay lot restroom is uni sex with the toilet directly facing the urinal ughh gross overall the most food wa really good and unique the price are just a little too high for the portion size the best i ve tried so far this week i ve eaten at five different restaurant prior i m out of town really nice service without being overwhelming responsive staff i sat at the bar the place is really cute and intimate ambiance is perfect i came alone and enjoyed the experience so well the bar tender are artist and care about the drink i really like that food came at a great pace loved my soup and pork belly also had dark and stormy which wa perfect this place is great we went here a a part of my brithday bar crawl we showed up a a party of with no notice on a friday night and they got u seated pretty quickly i do recommend though making a reservation or calling ahead if you plan on taking a larger party a it is a pretty small place it wa an unexpected stop on our tour though the rum drink are amazing our server wa very knowledgeable and made great suggestion for everyone at the table who had question i had a hemingway daiquiri which is one of my favorite and it wa excellent too spicy too not i wish i could find a middle ground for it all all the rum in the world cannot the essence of jamaican flare for food eating in the bar is for the brave only a you will be tossed and turned while eating plan ahead on a weekend and make a reservation this is one of the best if not the only place to try every rum from the caribbean in the valley they have highly skilled bartender and a rotating cocktail menu i d recommend one of their classic like a rum old fashion or dark and stormy they also have more exotic drink like a trade wind swizzle n nif the rum alone isn t enough to consider this spot a a must try the food is fantastic a well i recommend the jerk chicken most of all n ngo in say hello to dwayne and enjoy yourself went early during first friday last week and scored a spot at the bar thank god for that because this place wa tiny and i wouldn t recommend it for group n nhaving said that we ordered whatever the bartender suggested different drink in all and found them all to be outstanding we would ve liked to try some of their rum but there wa no help offered figuring out how to sample those it s a bit overwhelming n nthe nice thing is that you can order food from the adjoining restaurant however the jerk spice on the perfectly cooked scallop wa so spicy that i could not eat it food and service is great i love their drink and the ambience it is overall very pricey and sometimes a little overpriced i only go there when i have to spend in one sitting absolutely amazing swanky classy delectable body rubbable and so much more love the drink very refreshing love the food very fresh and flavorful i will definitely go back n nhowever get rid of the double standard for dress code if men can t wear a sleeveless shirt then neither should the woman and by the way this is arizona and degree this wa our first time to breadfruit i wa really impressed the service wa impeccable and the food excellent in an intimate but colorful space a really nice date night this place is special in my heart their quality value and pride do not budge if you do not get it or like it it ha got to be based on your lack of knowledge and palette a unique bar in any major city in the known world it ha one of the most legit expensive cocktail in the united state their is extreme value a the quality of the food is fine dining there is no way to mirror the drink a the essence and bitter are made in house you can pick up in suttlties in every bite a there is always something new to be discovered the amount of knowledge between the chef and head bartender whom are both owner and have the courage to put their name on their own place is unmatched by any point in recordable history a it would be impossible for any chef nor bartender in the past based on modern communication technology to have such a vast range of flavor with such an acute delivery i am positive if you didn t enjoy yourself here you were too drunk and they were worried about your safety you were extremely rude a their employee are not slave your lack of tact offended other tactful guest and you were asked to leave or you simply want to be cheap and think complaining will make them lower their quality their menu is ever changing i have worked at plus bar in restaurant in two major city i posse year in the industry and offer no favor to anyone this is the perfect place for multiple course during a date you re guaranteed to impress a great place to splurge or have a quick two course with a cocktail or two within the bar there is high quality rum and rum that will never be available to the world again two year ago i couldn t stand rum and now i want to be jamaican clean and trustworthy if you made an as of yourself before you need not worry a this place hold no grudge so long a you mind your manner the carrot juice is amazing everything is organic and thoughtfully purchased and produced the veggie meal are incredible and the desert are to die for totally worth it happy hour for drink nice ambience and super customer service and salt fish fritter i didn t give star due to not trying actual food but great overall very impressed by the level of service and food everything had such flavor and a little taste if jamaica in every bite truly a must when you re in town we went to breadfruit last night for a saturday dinner when we got there there were two other couple on the place but it filled up while we were eating which mean two other party sat down the place is lovely and tiny n nour waiter owner not sure wa extremely enthusiastic about the menu and the special appetizer of the day which wa jerk scallop he really wanted u to order them well fine i love scallop so why not and they were excellent my only complaint there were two scallop and they cost more than each of our meal had i known that ahead of time and no i didn t ask i wouldn t have ordered them but it s a small complaint n nthe food everything wa very tasty i ordered the brown chicken stew and dh ordered the jerk chicken and he even liked the mango salsa that came with it he usually scrape all strange and exotic food item to the side of his plate n nwe also had the avocado plantain roll for appetizer and they were great the special drink are also quite delicious n nthe place is clean bright and fun i would definitely go again to sample some other menu item i finally had the opportunity to check out this place along with some fellow yelpers this past thursday international supper club fun the place is small and very quaint think of cute but kinda expensive date night let me start off by saying that although the food wa good the price didn t quite match the portion n ni started off with the the pina colada a my drink of the night which wa shaken and not blended very good i will say that the drink are worth the price it wa but it wa good and strong so one wa plenty the mussel that were ordered for the table were quite good it did have the smokey flavor and the broth that wa left wa good for dipping the bread in good eats n ni next ordered the oven roasted plantain for my appetizer which were very good however i received slice and it cost or roughly per slice plantain themselves before cooking are a decent size however the slice i received were just a normal small slice you would get at any restaurant that ha them a an appetizer i have had plantain at other place and received much more and the cost wa much le n nfor my main course i ordered scallop you receive average size scallop and a side of rice and pea the scallop were good but i am not sure that they were good maybe they were nice and spicy and they did melt in your mouth but other than that there wa nothing extra special about them n nsome people ordered dessert and i knew that it wa going to be bad not the dessert but the cost of the dessert and the portion they received didn t match one bit for the smallest piece of upside pineapple cake i have ever seen maybe but the fact that it cost more than our drink yowza although everyone seemed pretty pleased with their meal they were a little surprised by how much everything cost in comparison to the portion i am not asking for some huge over the top portion but still this place is not frou frou enough to charge what they charge great chicken curry patty unfortunately it look like they re off the menu all i see are spinach and tilapia patty coco bread wa buttery pretty tasty and i loved it texture and it too look like it s off the menu for a side of steamed veggie wa a joke i kid you not i saw one cabbage leaf one very thin slice of tomato and one ultra thin sliced ring of red bell pepper honestly i didn t think it wa possible to slice something that thin ah one word mandolin all served on a teacup plate i felt so ripped off n nrestroom wa clean and so wa the rest of the restaurant had dinner at the breadfruit rum bar this evening with a special friend i googled best seafood restaurant in downtown phoenix and they appeared she love seafood so there we went the staff is extra attentive very up to speed on the ingredient and it s clear the chef take pride in quality and detail i m vegan and finding something wa easy and it wa delicious dwayne taylor tamra mila and javier were outstanding from walking in to being seated to answering every question offering multiple recommendation all good and the energy is very positive the owner dwayne said they re going on year i ve only been here month but i m mad i didn t hear about it sooner a must dine if you haven t already done so cocktail were very good food wa also good however plate were small for the price overall loved it sitting at the bar is the best spot my new favorite place the mixologist take their craft seriously and each cocktail is a work of art they make their own syrup no bottled mix here appreciate the authentic reggae music playing in the background and the beautiful ambiance a relaxed but higher end establishment in addition an intimate outdoor back patio with tropical island feel and lot of humidity pumping through the mister for cigar smoking cigar sold there a well ahhhh breadfruit where do i begin with your delicious cocktail your fun and happenin atmosphere i wish that s where this review wa going but ala i left your establishment with a bad taste in my mouth n nlet me begin by saying this wa a solid star maybe even before i got my bill the special fish sounded great and after craig went on and on about how they have their own fish monger and how the fish is flown in daily and yadda yadda yadda how could i resist the fish wa good the portion wa ridiculously small and the accoutrement were completely forgettable so riddle me this how is it that on a menu where no item is more than buck all item very well priced by the way that the special fish is f ing dollar i mean if you have a special that is more than twice most of the entree s on your menu you best inform the customer i wa not pleased to receive my bill and discover that little surprise on the check seriously had the fish been priced closer to the rest of the entree s the anger i am spewing currently would be much le vitriolic n nadditionally the accoutrement grilled pineapple ok i get it it s sweet deep fried bread wtf you could lash these bastard together and float back to jamaica on em and coleslaw that is obviously meant a a garnish and not to be eaten give me a freakin break n nthe red bean and rice were whatever my wife s jerk chicken wa dry and needed that chutney to be at all edible and the meal itself wa completely forgettable tack on the not so great souffle that craig talked u into and the more i ve thought about my dining experience at breadfruit the more pissed off i am i m buck lighter entree drink desert and tip sure sure it wa my fault for ordering all that but c mon man i mean really n ni will return to this fun and drinkably tasty locale again for perhaps appetizer and drink most definitely the drink and the atmosphere when i m in the downtown area but i will here for to pas on further dining experience the rum bar wa such a neat little bar down town but if you don t like rum this is not your place they only serve red stripe or rum but what a collection i liked the vibe of the place very chill and a nice patio a well the server were really personable and knowledgable i wa fascinated watching them make their drink with all the tincture and exotic ingredient felt very sophisticated what do you say when you discover a wonderful restaurant tell others accidentally ran across this gem last night on edge of downtown phoenix and had fantastic dinner and drink menu emphasizes fresh seafood but i wa lucky to be there one of the evening each month when they have their special succulent braised oxtail marinated overnight in jamaican flavor and cooked slowly for most of the day then served with rice and perfect mix of grilled fresh summer pattypan squash with sauteed eggplant and olive an outstanding dessert of chocolate cake with center of molten chocolate rum and side of real whipped cream amazing bar with over rum served up lively pomegranate lime mint mojito hot ginger mint tea wa served a chunk of fresh ginger and mint leaf under hot water in a french press tea a it wa meant to be professional friendly staff moderate price and local artist work on the wall make this a great evening and great deal not many jamaican restaurant around so our group thought it sounded interesting we had a reservation for p m on a saturday night which wa confirmed the day before and they told u they were going to place u at the high top table in the bar we arrived on time and the restaurant wa crowded we noticed there wa another group seated at our table we were a little annoyed that we had to wait minute until this group left and they cleared the table there wa no apology no explanation my friend who only drink vodka wa not happy that they only had rum and wine the food wa alright but no one in the group wa raving about any of it and it wa pricey i ve been to breadfruit a couple of time now my most recent experience wa in the last hour with a couple of friend i should start this review my noting that i love jamaican food in general i love food that mix fruity and spicy and yet aren t too heavy on the stomach n nfor the food the coleslaw and corn are excellent side item the bread is decent and interesting flavour though a bit on the tough side for main dish i have had the jerk chicken and jerk prawn indeed for me the jerk chicken wa the better the shrimp wa not filling at all for prawn is not only a rip off for a restaurant that serf with paper napkin but it leaf you wanting more in a bad way the plantain and avocado roll are perhaps the only thing on the menu worth the price they are perfectly paired with the mango chutney the scallop dish is quite appalling for value a well the waiter might have done well by u to mention that the half order for had only medium sized scallop for you could get the full order but then what s the point also at the table wa a house salad of sort which while it ha potential went half eaten n nalso a plus they have finally gotten a beer license so they can finally serve appropriately jamaican red stripe lager at it isn t the best deal in downtown phoenix though nickel and dimed again n na for the service and management there are not positive sign for this restaurant it ha managed to stay in business and good on them on the other hand while the décor is nice and pleasant typical jamaican with it s yellow and green wall the place is noisy and that is odd considering we were the only three patron in the restaurant management would do well to put up a plexiglas room divider the restaurant doe have a nice glass façade which allows a pleasant view of the street unfortunately the location is on st and pierce which offer some of the worst view in all of downtown phoenix ala this location go to waste it really is impressive that the place hasn t closed down my last impression is of the wait staff while the staff two year ago wa helpful and polite we three agreed that the new staff wa pushy and unhelpful over and over we were pushed to order item we insisted we didn t want and when it came to selling u on the dish and informing u of the small skewer of prawn or the scallop appetizer he seemed to have forgotten i guess it s a bit like a used car salesman n ntoo bad i can t think of another jamaican restaurant in phoenix i d love to try it next time sat at the bar for cocktail and dessert love their selection of run concoction had the rum cake will go back for dinner what a disappointment treatment awful came all the way from northern california our phoenix host were very excited to treat u to dinner at a jamaican restaurant he left work picked up his year old and met his wife and u his out of town guest at the restaurant we were wondering if they would have food for the year old who ha some food allergy and would have understood if they did not what we did not understand wa the treatment we got when we inquired we were told the chef doe not adjust any recipe okay fine but we weren t prepared when the help wa joined by what appeared to be owner and or manager who proceeded to say they are an adult restaurant and they seldom get kid in the restaurant in a very condescending manner i wa shocked at the tone and could not believe it what about service what about a nice welcome wish we could accommodate you but we were a party of adult the dad wa willing to take his year old and feed him elsewhere but the cold and callous way we were treated make that place not worthy of one star just my opinion definitely don t take kid to their adult restaurant and don t ask for any deviation from the cooking of the menu per the help the chef will not make change to his menu came in a few time before and ordered drink with dinner the trick to liking this place is to order drink at the counter that wa you get to see the giant hunk of ginger see the bar tender squeezing lime watch them actuallly muddle drink with care the drink are good but the show even better this isn t your normal cafe n nthese people understand the taste of the caribbean and after a meal or two you will also everything seems to be on the spicy side something i like but might not be for everyone great flavor amazing smell and the cocktail might just be some of the best you will ever have n nyou owe it to yourself to give it a try there are very few place around downtown to have a drink and cigar but this is one of them stocked by churchill s cigar a local cigar shop rum bar ha a reasonable selection of about eight or ten cigar and a bar full of rum and a mixologist to go with it if you re into rum drink this is also one of the best spot in town to get one n nthere are definitely a handful of shop in the area you can pick up a cigar but none of them are open past or pm and none of them will serve you a cocktail while you smoke when i m out with the pal and in the mood for a cigar it s generally not before pm you ve got to have a bit of forethought for that and i m rarely blamed for foreword thinking that s for sure sure the drink are premium priced and the cigar too but this is the spot when you re looking to pair them up n nnote that smoking is only on their outdoor patio and not in an inside lounge it would be nice to find a spot with an inside smoking lounge in the downtown area but beggar can t be chooser right n nhappy yelping phoenix see you around downtown very disappointed with this restaurant planned to meet friend for dinner so i called breadfruit on wednesday to make a reservation for saturday evening at we arrived on time and the restaurant had no record of my reservation they told u that they couldn t give u a table for over an hour we left and had a nice dinner at another restaurant delicious island food that is served by cook on island time come well before you are hungry if you like rude slow service and dry mediocre over priced food then this is your place nso much potential great location and cute restaurant but the food and service need help np not kid friendly it wa girl night out dinner before going to see chelsea handler perform at comerica theatre n nfirst thought a we entered wa the place wa quaint clean good music and empty we were the second table to be sat for dinner at n nwe ordered drink all rum by the way a couple of the gal were shocked that a rum bar didn t serve vodka so we were off to a great start my mojito ponganot wa amazing and that is the only good thing i have left to say about this place n nwe ordered appetizer the oven roasted plantain just meh and we also ordered the fresh baked patty one tilapia and one spinach i thought the crust wa a bit on the dry side two of u thought they were good good enough to order another one which ended up never being served to u n nthe major disappointment wa the one entree that we made this trip for wa sold out hmmm we were the second table to be seated the other table hadn t ordered yet and what is it you ask that they sold out of why the popcho sweet ginger basically baby bok choy wow now that is an ingredient you can t find oh i don t know everywhere n nwe ended up eating salad which were good fresh but frankly could have made just a easily at home the bread that wa offered and not on menu and therefore assumed to come with the meal wa breadstick with a hint of vanilla good but stick for almost no thanks n nthe kicker wa when we asked them to call u a cab we sat for minute and nothing we asked again and finally this time saw them pick up a phone we were then told we could sit outside to free up the table this wa after paying our tab i have never had this occur at a restaurant yes i know it wa a friday night but we were finishing our drink we had paid and tipped well and think that they could afford to have u sit there for minute waiting on a cab they forgot to call n ni might have returned even based on the lackluster food just for the drink but i can certainly say after the rudeness we would never return drink on point good fantastic ambiance wonderful service wa excellent can be a little to formal but i holding them back great spot owner should be proud of their business will go back and tell others three word n n hot buttered rum n noh emm gee food wa really good here i like the atmosphere but wa not a fan of some of the seating spot one right next to the bathroom yuk luckily a new table came up and we moved the mojitos were excellent scallop were good but almost too spicy the tofu curry wa awesome and the jerk pork and polenta wa good i wish had a little more depth though but the okra wa a good addition to it maybe a few more would have been nice our waitress wa good but seemed very stressed out or frustrated which wa clear notherwise a good spot very cozy and i think i will try it again i am totally irie after tonight s dinner at the breadfruit what a great little gem in phoenix the lady of the house and i went a i d been following the place on yelp and seeing the great review in the local paper n ni m familiar with island food having spent my high school year in florida during a period of much emigration from haiti jamaica and the other island it wa a real pleasure to see the classic presented in a modern setting n nthe breadfruit just got their liquor license normally we don t start with cocktail but the drink menu looked amazing i chose my favorite carrot juice which is made with carrot juice coconut milk vanilla and more loved it the lady had the sorrel and later the pink ting she loved it n nwe started with their perfect appleton rum sea scallop and a spinach patty the scallop were cooked just right and were on the money with regard to spice the spinach patty is such a basic thing really delicate with some unexpected savory taste n nshe had curried chicken and dumpling superb the whole wheat dumpling wa unexpected and had a thick bit to it the go alongs were cabbage green banana and plantain i got to taste most of it and found it to be perfect island comfort food n ni had the estovich fish and festival tonight s fish wa red snapper which i love they used their jerk rub to heat it up and put the estovich on the side good move a you can heat it up scotch bonnet style a much a you d like this came with grilled pineapple coleslaw and one festival said corn on the menu but it never came n nservice wa superb our server jason asked if it wa our first time and where we d heard of them when i said yelp he quickly jotted this on the order pad this waiter wa great at anticipating our question and explaining the menu goodup guy a the jamaican say the breadfruit and rumbar ha been serving downtown phoenix patron tasty jamaican food since but i finally checked it out for the first time this past weekend i fell in love with it instantly and can t wait to go back n nthe breadfruit and rumbar is a charming jamaican eatery with an extensive selection of more than rum i had one of my new favorite cocktail there the changing daily punch bowl special made with fresh pomegranate and cranberry juice it wa so refreshing plus pretty strong and i could have sipped them all night long and if you re into cigar you can purchase one there to pair with your rum too n nwe started with the plantain avocado spring roll paired with a mango chutney if you like the avocado roll at kona grill you ll definitely like these and it s nice to know the breadfruit locally source all their menu item so everything is extremely fresh n ni m usually not a huge tofu fan but i took the recommendation of our server to order the coconut curry tofu it wa a really hearty delicious dish and the tofu reminded me of chicken bit i really liked it the rice and bean they re called pea on the menu wa my favorite part of the dish which also came with veggie and plantain it wa a great variety of food and really filling i d highly recommend it n nmy boyfriend got the jerk chicken which he said wa the best jerk chicken he d ever had n nbesides the tasty food the atmosphere at the breadfruit wa so pretty the lounge area wa dark and sophisticated you won t find any sport television and the main dining room wa small and cozy service wa excellent and i d recommend it a a great date place i wish there were more star to give this place is amazing the scallop are some of the best scallop i have had anywhere i just wish they would bring back the entrée version the pork belly is to die for a well now let u talk about the rum with over a to choose from you will not be let down although rum is not normally my choice in spirit the dark and stormy here get me every time the homemade ginger beer is delicious even though we don t live in phoenix anymore anytime we visit we make it to breadfruit definitely make a reservation a they are always busy this is my double review n nmy wife and i participate in a monthly dinner club with a small group of couple we go in alphabetical order and each couple get to pick a spot for dinner basically twice per year after doing a date night at breadfruit not too long ago we decided to make this the spot for our month and we all descended upon breadfruit n nso this friend is the tale of two visit star for our date night for sure my girlfriend and i ubered it that night so indulged in what i might call a wonderfully intoxicating evening the selection of rum at breadfruit and duh rum bar is nothing short of amazing in fact they do a fine job of proving that you can make just about anything with rum n ni wa fortunate to have sealed the deal with lucrative new client at work that week a well so i treated u to a couple of glass of per shot appleton estate rum i must say my girlfriend wa so smitten with my confident seemingly incredible knowledge of rum that she accepted my marriage proposal n nok ok that last part wa mostly fantasy we did get engaged and married since that date night but it s not because i m a rum expert i m not it s not because i can afford a couple of shot of rare rum either i can t regardless try the rum cocktail and if you won the powerball or are just having a great day try some of the pricier rum you ve never heard of before n nof course date night included a wonderful meal at a small table for two a well love the atmosphere and love the food we were seated promptly shared a small plate a couple of entree and desert and it wa all delicious we had lot of leftover to enjoy later n n nour dinner club wa mostly the same story we had some confusion when we arrived though the restaurant is small there s a small bar near the entrance with a waiting area lounge and one long table which ended up being where our party wa seated for dinner then there s the dining room which is not much larger and straight out from the back of the bar is a nice patio with a waterfall some heater and booth area sort of ha a loungy feel outside breadfruit also ha a nice selection of cigar and this is where you can enjoy them n nthe two of u enjoyed a cocktail outside while we waited for our table to be prepared then were seated for dinner a the rest of our table arrived but you can t just go out onto the patio yourself you have to be seated out there a well so it wa a bit much for the hostess to first prepare a table for u outside while also preparing a table for u inside we misunderstood some of the thing she said a well and it wa confusing at first when we began to follow her to one place or another because we thought we were supposed to but were then told to go back up front and wait then be shuttled out back then be shuttled back inside to our dinner table n ni again very much enjoyed my dinner kimberly and i shared the salt fish fritter nothing short of awesome and i had the pimiento wood jerk chicken which wa half a game hen it wa rubbed with a house jerk seasoning and it wa absolutely delicious n ni d probably give the dinner club visit star because of the confusion up front but in my opinion the food and drink were once again top notch so i m leaving my tale of two visit a a star review enjoy breadfruit the breadfruit wa amazing a little on the expensive side for dinner for drink each and an app but it is worth every penny service wa great drink were some of the best i have ever had and jerk chicken wa so tasty we will be back i am absolutely amazed people actually like this place i went in with my mother and girlfriend and also a few family friend a few week back and decided to write today a i still can not get over the awful food and service i honestly would not have cared so much about the service if the food wa actually good although it wa terrible when we moved from the bar to the restaurant side we were the only customer they had a there were seven of u when a friend that lived in the area stopped by the waitress made a huge deal about adding one more person and wa rude to both my mother and her friend the waitress and staff in general had an attitude that they were better and we should be happy to eat in their establishment we are all professional and were dressed a such after working a full day the drink were overpriced and terrible chicken wa burnt portion were small and gross everything wa overpriced i would not recommend this place to anyone i m usually very satisfied with my dining experience here this time the conch dinner entree wa not good i thought i d try something different and i love muscle type food ie calamari clam but this dish had no flavor whatsoever the flavor are why i go here everything else wa wonderful but trust me do not order this dish i made reservation here for my birthday for a party of on a monday for the patio my party and i show up and the host seems like he can barely force a smile out he indicates our table is set up inside to which i reply i had made a reservation for the patio i am still incredulous at his response when he say that can t be accommodated because they didn t know this is their oversight and not even the slightest notion to correct this all the meanwhile the patio and restaurant in general have a total nof table wow n nmy friend can see i am a bit shocked and bummed so they chime in that it is my birthday and can t something be done to accommodate u on this special occasion nope literally got a sneer from the host in response so our only option is to accept this table inside where the smell of old seafood seems to linger oh and i forgot to mention that we were missing one person so our party couldn t be seated right away remember there are only other table occupied and no wait again wow n nso we sidle up to the empty bar to wait and the bartender who actually seems very friendly offer u the drink special for the evening one of my friend asks to sample this and our bartender extremely hesitantly pours her a sip i do not blame him for this hesitation since i am sure management influenced this with the le than accommodating environment they foster at this point we haven t even been sat and it is a dining experience from my worst dream albeit on the day i want to celebrate with my close friend i call it a wrap and we bounce out of there and celebrate at cibo instead n ngive me a break breadfruit not even michelin star restaurant feel like they have the posterity to treat their customer this way i will not return and will certainly discourage people from dining at your establishment over priced and not that good liked the setting but the food really wa not up to par had the scallop lobster and fresh fish of the day n nlobster wa very very small and way over cooked the fresh fish wa not so fresh and wa burned not blackened but honestly burned n nonly redeeming factor wa the cocktail sorry guy i don t intend to return but based on the way we were treated by the kitchen earlier this week my uncouth self doesn t exactly feel welcome anyway however i m not quite convinced that it s my loss n nit had been almost a year since my original visit to breadfruit which did not overwhelm a you can judge by it taking me a year to make it back but i did have an appreciation of the option for caribbean cuisine n nsince a friend and i were going to be downtown for an event i suggested breadfruit for our dinner spot we enjoy good food and supporting local the option to pick up wine at the public market next door and have the already reasonable corkage fee waived wa a bonus a we had really enjoyed a couple of the arizona stronghold wine at a recent fnb wine pairing and thought they would pair well with the jamaican heat n nwhile the scallop were delicious and cooked perfectly for per scallop is a tad steep in my book we also shared the jerk chicken salad and the jerk prawn off the grill n nhere s the ultimate rub the bottom of the menu state no substitution or modification since when is cutting a kfc side sized ear of corn a modification n nat the same time the menu describes the restaurant and it s offering a nothing fancy simply good food that nourishes and rejuvenates the body n nit seems like cutting something in half so we could easily share it particularly after the plate ha been delivered to the table for u to appreciate it s beauty and after we ve communicated to our server and demonstrated with the first two course that we were splitting the item is in the vein of nothing fancy n nhow about providing the customer with an appropriate utensil to cut it themselves then n nthe fact that the chef wa obstinate in refusing to cut the kfc side sized ear of corn provided with our entree scream pretentious and grandiose and tainted our entire experience n nto quote my dinning companion you are not james beard and james beard would ve cut the corn the bar is full of amazing rum selection that speak to you when you walk in the drink menu is simple and they have some delicious option i ordered the jerk chicken and enjoyed every bite i will visit again not a fan we sat outside and there were fly everywhere i don t know why they wouldn t have citronella or something the food is crazy overpriced but it is tasty i can t rationalize the we spent on scallop overall a good a the food wa we won t be dining here again jamaican me crazy wa recommended by a client and glad i gave it a try if you are looking for a cozy intimate dinner and mouth watering rum cocktail this is the spot to be i went here for my birthday about couple week ago and there service is excellent the food wa great i highly recommend the chilean sea bass and the jerk chicken i will definitely be coming for more this a wonderful place with some of the best food in phoenix the rum drink are incredibly innovative the staff are very friendly and knowledgable the atmosphere is cozy and warm this is a great evening spot in downtown phx the rear patio ha a lot of character and is a perfect spot to unwind and enjoy some rum the cuisine authentic and delicious my colleague from jamaica thought it wa super legit a well the food is delicious and authentic they use real scotch bonnet pepper here so it ha a very good flavor not every thing is spicy but spice can be added to anything just ask they are nice be warned caribbean red pepper is very hot taste is like a sweet phenomenal jalapeno but about hotter spice n nupdate i have ernt back a few time since and noticed that some of the service is kinda pushy not to me directly but it easy to notice i can t really review the rum bar without reviewing breadfruit they are really one in the same and breadfruit s food stole the day but to be honest we have never physically be in to breadfruit we only go to the rum bar and we love this place i have been there time once when i wa a sardine and packed into the place without room to even breathe once with my parent in the comfy window seating are and once with my husband on a romantic date for i loved it every time and by the third time i wa told by my husband you have to yelp this place now and he then exclaimed i think this is my favorite food in the entire city n nmy husband is not one to stake claim on anything le than spectacular he is married to me so here i am giving them the highest rating and review i can muster n nthe drink are extremely tasty unique clever and strong i love the rum and the free tasting we have had of the various type of rum this place ha really opened my mind and expanded my knowledge i like that the bartender and staff always ask our name and take an interest in what we are eating drinking talking about and liking about life they are so kind n nbut and yes there s a but the rum bar experience won t be bringing u back it s the food that is the big draw what a great culinary experience every bite is a wonderful adventure the spice the mixture of fruit with the savory dish the fish oh the fish n nwe plan on going back again and again the location is a little tricky to find but if you found sen turf it s in the same block nearly the same building but just around the corner don t despair just walk south and take a left east and you ll see breadfruit on the left excellent waitress service very friendly and knowledgeable n nfood is excellent very healthy clean nothing fried all farmer market ingredient cool spot of downtown phoenix mango lemonade is very good nice spice decided on the breadfruit and rum bar for my husband s birthday a his family is from a caribbean island the service wa absolutely outstanding staff were very polite and made excellent recommendation cocktail were inventive and quite tasty food wa delicious and my only complaint wa not having more johnny cake with the jerk shrimp husband wa offered a choice of rum or dessert on the house for his birthday which wa nice and unexpected the restaurant is a little pricey but everything wa so delicious it wa worth the extra cost highly recommend i walked here on my lunch and decided to try the jerk chicken salad the server wa friendly quiet kind and not pushy i ordered my salad and a ginger beer to go i wa impressed with their drink selection n nthere were only a few other people in the small restaurant when i sat down to wait minute for my food the ginger beer wa good it had a nice strong bite to it when i got back to the office to enjoy my salad i wa a little surprised n nthe flavor of the salad wa really good and the ingredient were fresh however the spice on the chicken made it very very spicy i would say it wa a little too much for my taste and i enjoy spicy food i just don t like my food so hot that my eye start to water and i can t stop sniffling from my nose running n nnow maybe it s not always that hot and that wa a one time thing hard to say i m thinking i should go back and give it or something else on the menu another try everything looked way to good to give up on this place after only one spicy chicken incident had the pleasure of visiting the breadfruit on saturday night usually don t go out of my way to write a review unless i wa really blown away by a place wa able to make reservation the night before which wa nice i really find it astonishing that this place ha only star for the place it is i have to agree the place is a bit small but not to the point where you feel crammed to start out the ambiance of the place is so relaxed and at the same time formal dim lighting a fresh aroma and jamaican reggae tune in the background we were seated right away to our table and were served by carly which i gotta say really made the night she knew the food and drink menu like if she wa the chef and bartender herself for the drink i had the spanish gentleman and the shorty which i gotta say have probably been some of the best cocktail i ve ever had started with the small plate scallop and then the woodfired jerk chicken the combination of herb and spice really come together for an incredible experience of flavor in your mouth to my surprise i found out that the host himself dwayne is the actual owner of the restaurant when you see the owner a involved in his business that way you know the standard will be high ended up running a pretty big tab and have never felt better about paying for such a nice dinner please don t give your star review a joan p did below just because the jamaican caribbean restaurant did not have your vegan option come on go eat your grass somewhere else smdh thank you dwayne and carly i will sure be seeing you again very soon i really enjoyed my visit to this restaurant an upscale carribean dive that ha great location food and drink what more could you ask for i had the jerk chicken and the vegetable medley the jerk chicken wa seasoned and cooked to perfection with the right amount of heat the rum punch wa great and the server were kind my only complaint would be the pricing compared to the portion size not sure if this could be the best option price wise when looking to satisfy your jerk craving but it will be an option you wouldnt regret the best jamaican food i ve had i m jamaican and i live in california and this is the best jamaican food i ve had the prawn were to die for and the fish wa wonderful the server were very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu def will be back back to arizona just to eat here lol this is the stylish lounge adjacent to the cozy jamaican restaurant known a the breadfruit i loved the vibe of this place a soon a i walked in the door their list of rum is quite impressive so if you are a connoisseur then you simply must go here they have a menu of fun signature cocktail that were mostly tropical themed it sort of reminded me of hula s modern tiki bar in that respect but in this case the rum really are the main focus and any fruit juice or other mixer are meant to enhance and highlight the flavor of the rum itself the first one i tried wa the spicy rumtini which wa really delicious though i expected more heat my husband wanted a jack and diet coke but wa told that they had neither no whiskey since rum are their thing and they also don t offer soda with artificial sweetener however the bartender recommended he try the tennessee rum cider this drink tasted surprisingly like whiskey but actually is made with a rum called prichard s fine which is made in tennessee mixed with an organic apple cider the second drink that i tried wa a dark and stormy i had this drink at citizen public house and didn t really care for it but i really enjoyed this one now don t get me wrong i am well aware that cph mix up the best cocktail on the planet but i just happened to like this particular drink here at the rum bar better one of my companion said it wa because of the type of rum they use gosling n nthe cocktail were all or and their wine were a glass but they had do cabezas yay so because of that this would never be someplace i would come drink on a regular basis though i certainly don t mind splurging on a premium cocktail every once in a while i saw they also had a cigar patio so i think this would be the perfect place for a classy bachelor party or b day fantastic drink and cuisine that go above and beyond whatever resort food you ve had in jamaica n nmy jerk pork wa fantastic sweet and savory with just the right amount of heat and i really enjoyed the brussels sprout that accompanied the dish and i hate brussels sprout seriously i ve tried them at some of the fanciest restaurant ever and i ve always despised them i have no idea what dwayne s chef do to make them not only edible but fantastic n nmy wife had the red snapper which she found a little disconcerting a it wa served whole however the preparation and spicing were perfect and any initial trepidation wa quickly removed with the first bite it wa served with some sweet ish bread and a pickled dipping sauce outstanding n nwe sat at the bar where we were expertly taken care of by a busy bartender neither of u are huge rum aficionado but he found the perfect cocktail or three that no only fit our palate but exquisitely paired with our dish n nbreadfruit is a small and intimate setting if you re in a hurry it s probably not for you if you re looking for an extensive menu or have food issue or non adventurous tastebud it s probably not for you and if you re trying to re create that one time you went to jamaica a decade ago head back to sandal n nbut you can bet that we ll be back there are still plenty of experience to be had this tiny place on an off the beat street downtown surprised me i heard it described a a hole in the wall nothing could be further it s delightfully clean and crisp interior is tastefully decorated very hip the food is fresh fresh fresh and delicious n nfried plaintains yum tofu in a curry sauce yowza oh and this delightful iced um tea it wa more like a clove tea perhaps very spicy had to alternate between sip of that and water but overall a very friendly inviting place service wa lovely and attentive and everything wa great the portion were large so i had leftover for lunch the next day too nnote that there is an inexpensive corkage fee on beer or wine so bring your own oh and free corkage on tuesday it s a shame to go to a place that ha great food and drink that is spoiled by server that have the personality of a donkey this place just ha a pretentious feel about it if you re looking for a place that make you feel welcomed and appreciated don t go here great good and drink along with snobby service cheer dear breadfruit may we suggest one small business decision when your customer tell you they can t eat the food because it s so incredibly over spiced and beg for something to cut the heat do not may i repeat do not charge them for a tablespoon of chutney that come in a tiny dish n and while we re at it when a customer can t eat the over acidy and untasty messy coleslaw and can t eat the main dish and ha devoured the one eight piece of corn that pass a vegetable do not may i repeat do not charge for a second tiny piece of corn n so sorry we won t be back this is my favorite restaurant in the world everything is not only on point but excels at everything it try n n ambiance gorgeous quiet lighting dark and intimate you can choose between sitting on the small patio or inside a balance between quiet experience yet still fun and lively n the drink beat the blue wa a colossal success balancing the earthiness of beat juice spiciness of cinnamon and other spice and of course the rum all the drink are rum based and fabulous actually including the punch of the day n the food caribbean so lot of jerk and seafood yet there are also vegetarian option n the service absolutely incredible every waitress waiter i ve had have always been so accommodating n ni look forward to the next time i get to go to phoenix and eat here again great rum selection and rum cocktail the food wa also wonderful but the portion were just a little bit too small very fun place to forget being in phoenix and enjoy fun flavor i found this place to be warm friendly and with very good food i enjoyed the avocado spring roll rice pea and the roasted corn on the cobb to top it all off i had two cup of delicious carrot juice the waitress wa attentive and personable my all time favorite place in phoenix make sure you sit at the bar the bartender are extremely knowledgable regarding rum and the drink they offer they are super friendly just know that if you order the sometime in august you will be drinking bacon from a glass i didn t care for it but all the other drink we tried were amazing we didn t try the shorty but it ll be first on our list next visit they fill the glass with smoke from burning sage before pouring the drink look awesome i don t even like rum but the drink were amazing the food wa also amazing finishing the night with hot buttered rum and a cigar on the back patio wa perfection made it hot buttered rum n njust go there wa not impressed with happy hour the only drink special wa a rum punch and half off beer and wine there were only beer other than that all the other cocktail were priced normally aka expensive also the staff wa not friendly besides our waiter who wa very nice and didn t bother to try and make u feel welcome they also didn t bother to tell u bye or even acknowledge when we left i will say it wa nicely decorated and had a romantic ambiance but i will not be coming back for happy hour after a campus tour of asu my parent and i drove around downtown seeking a spot for lunch my mom saw a little sign on the corner that she thought said bread fruit we figured maybe we d grab sandwich or something nthen we walked up to find it wa actually breadfruit jamaican cuisine although it is definitely not what we had in mind we decided to stay we were so glad we did what a delicious delightful surprise nwe sat outside and the extremely accommodating waiter made sure the umbrella shaded u from the sun i must also note that the restroom wa impeccably maintained and super cute a well ni wa continuously impressed with the customer service throughout the meal i didn t actually look at the beverage selection and tried to order a diet coke when the waiter explained that everything is made fresh on site so soft drink are just not possible definitely another unexpected and awesome element of the restaurant i had the mango lemonade with crushed mint it wa divine n nwe ordered a variety of appetizer n pan seared scallop the waiter spoke highly of the sea scallop and explained how and where they are shipped from to ensure freshness i didn t even have to ask for this information but it wa another example of the service and commitment to quality i cannot speak highly enough of the scallop spicy and perfectly seared with some bell pepper and green onion drizzled with oil n plantain avocado spring roll yummy with a wonderful mango chutney you expect savory and get a little sweet instead there s only two on the plate so don t expect a huge quantity n fresh baked patty empanadas we got both the spinach and tilapia i would definitely get these again the tilapia had a nice little spice to it n house tropical salad perfect on a hot day cool and refreshing and perfectly paired with any menu item n nsince i ve decided to go to asu i definitely plan to return and byob awesome and i plan to keep that in mind nunfortunately because i will be a super broke student this place may be out of my price range sometimes the average plate is over but for the service quality and commitment to freshness and locality i think it is definitely worth it delicious food agree with all the favorable review on here don t quite get the bad one perhaps the most flavorful meal i ve had in phoenix the brown stew chicken is my favorite for sure very addictive and spiced just right on our second visit we learned it byo take a bottle of wine and they will open it there another plus they have blue mountain coffee shipped in direct from jamaica my friend and i wanted to try something new that would be a change from the normal food on the go meal we eat during the week so we made the trek on into phoenix and surprisingly found the place on the first try yes the sign on the main street helped it is a cozy place read small but it ha fun eclectic decoration and i loved the little light along the window n nthe waitress wa very friendly and we were soon set up sipping drink i loved the ginger beer so spicy and yummy for a drink that looked like hazy water never one to turn down plantain we ordered the avocado and plantain spring roll the chutney wa good and i liked that the roll weren t insanely greasy but they didn t seem that special to me nothing popped out n nthe brown stew chicken worked well a a comfort food but again there wasn t anything that would make me order it again what fascinated me wa my friend s chicken and dumpling it had good flavor and at the bottom of the plate wa a large round solid thing of well something i had never seen a dumpling like it and i have to admit to being skeptical but when you got a cut of it used it to wipe up some sauce the dumping wa great it wa heavy solid food and yummy a well the kind of food i d go out once in a while for and come back with a full tummy wanting nothing more but to lay out on the couch n nwe ordered coffee and shared the sweet potato pudding for dessert the two complemented each other perfectly i love sweet potato and this pudding wa no exception all in all i liked the dumpling loved the dessert and guzzled the coffee to stay awake for the ride home three star for killer cocktail and a great wait staff dock two for the appalling hostessing we walk in at announce we re going to have one drink and ask to sit indoors we re told all the table are reserved we sit outdoors on the totally un temperature controlled cigar patio in june in phoenix we walk back in to leave most of the table in the bar are still totally unoccupied there are too many other nice place to drink in phoenix to tolerate that level of service disappointed i wa really looking forward to eating jamaican food and had been craving it my husband wa excited to try jamaican food for the first time n nwhen i asked if i could have white rice instead of rice and pea i wa told the chef didn t alter the menu what i ended up ordering wa the nastiest thing ever some weird shredded beef the plaintains weren t even cooked all the way and were a bit raw n nmy husband s food wa just a bad we were so pissed that we wasted when we could ve gone to a real authentic jamaican restaurant only reason i m giving it a star is because our server wa great n nnever again my fiancée and i have visited the rum bar on numerous occasion with various combination of friend and recommended it to countless others being rum enthusiast my fiancée herself is caribbean we were thrilled when we initially thought wa a hidden gem this place ha gone downhill and we must not be the only one who think so a it wa almost empty tonight won t be going back anymore n nthe problem i think boil down to attitude on the part of the staff which i m guessing start with the ownership for example their tamarind ball ii drink come with a nice sweet tamarind ball on top a a garnish my fiancée love these so when we went tonight we asked if we could have a second on the cocktail the waitress said sure and it would be a no problem the bartender across the room start violently shaking his head no he informs u still across the room that these thing take hour to make and that we could not have any extra we were literally the only people in the room an hour before close not to mention you can get a bag of tamarind ball candy essentially for at food city just sloppy customer service the bartender seemed to take great pleasure in saying no n non top of that being regular we ve seen the cocktail menu change a few time and we have some favorite of old time not only do we know their name but we know their ingredient tonight we tried to order an older drink and were informed that if it not on the menu they won t make it plenty of other bar reward and even admire their regular for their loyalty and enjoy the nostalgia of older drink here i m guessing the bartender wa just too green judging by how much time the owner spent correcting him n nto finish it off i must mention the owner he get a lot of credibility around phoenix a a rum guy and i ve always admired him for being an ambassador of the spirit if you ve ever seen him at an event though or had the misfortune of being sat by him at the rum bar you d know he s got quite an air of superiority about him tonight he sat at the bar foot from u and heard u complain again we were the only table a top for over an hour on a thursday night he said not a word to u never asked after the food or the drink never thanked u for coming in never offered to explain any of the menu or the option he just sat at the bar until a minute to close when he quickly gathered his thing and left the place n ni imagine the staff dislike being here a much a i do so i don t fault them for this i do fault the owner though rum deserves better caribbean food deserves better phoenix deserves better overpriced especially the drink had a reservation and asked to sit outside but were told no even though the seat outside remained empty the whole time we were dining asked for le ice in my drink yes ten dollar for one drink that wa all ice no drink and wa told no that the bartender could not do that because the drink were measured perfectly food wa ok nothing special that i couldn t make at home my first time trying jamaican food and might i say that i wa not upset i had the curry tofu and it wa the perfect mix of spice absolutely delicious i wa blown away with the depth of taste very savory for cocktail i had caipirinhas off the menu and again i wa in awe i m not a fan of rum so i wa not sure what to expect but the caipirinhas wa great for deserter had buttered rum and rum cake again wa delicious must check out if visiting phx i stopped in this place after work for a quick bite and a few drink and am singularly unsatisfied the drink were overpriced to a preposterous extent we ordered two item off the small plate portion of the menu and they undoubtedly lived up to the name the portion wa smaller than the chance of them getting a good review at this point each plate had only enough food to leave a colony of ant hungry a spoon full of peanut butter would have left me more satisfied than the terrible excuse of a plate there the drink were more watered down than pop music on the radio if you do not value yourself and think you aren t worth having nice thing then this is your place food wa great we had the jerk chicken pork and polenta and lamb everything wa very good except for service bartender were short and rude and not very welcoming server wa very unpleasant and seemed very unhappy and impatient we will not be back least fun bar in phoenix for a rum bar it is super dull skip it or fall asleep while waiting for drink food is great and caribbean authentic desert are not the best at all lot of rum which is pretty cool it is very expensive for what it is i wouldnt do it often but it cool once my boyfriend and i went to the rum and cigar bar part of the establishment and isaac wa our server he wa amazing definitely should get a raise or praise from work he told u all about the history of the establishment how the drink would taste and how they paired with cigar really made my night to have such an attentive and sweet server excellent food portion were right sized not too big i had the fish which wa well spiced with habenero i agree with the other review that service is really slow though i m not sure why yuuum it wa my last night in phoenix and i wanted to have a nice meal before flying out i ordered the jerk chicken and a few vanilla mojitos it wa very well done and quite different than any other meal i ve had i would love to go back and try the rest of their menu i went to the rum bar at breadfruit with my friend to visit her boyfriend and grab some drink after first friday and if you want a great nay amazing mojito come to this bar it is the best n nthe price are pretty moderate for the specialty drink and food i ordered scallop for the appetizer they were cooked to perfection and my friend wrapped plantain and avocado so good n ni will definitely go back to try there dinner meal n ngood for group of to not good for anything larger n nrecommendation to anyone wanting to go to a dark bar and a great rum drink the food wa really good i liked everything i tried it s a little different that they dont do take out and they are not very accommodating with substitution and special request but the food is very satisfying so i will be back we went for lunch and i look forward to going for dinner and the new rumbar i really really like this place the seating area isnt that big but ha a friendly feel nthe chutney that is accompanied with most of the meal is great i tried the jamaican beer and wa a instant fan fyi this review is based only on the cocktail a i have not yet had the opportunity to eat here i went twice this past weekend i stopped in for one drink on friday night with a friend and went back with my wife and some friend on saturday after dinner to explore more of the cocktail menu we tried several drink on the menu and every cocktail wa clearly well crafted and perfected the bartender i think his name is brian wa very knowledgeable and easy going he is a very skilled bartender and you can tell that he really enjoys his craft n nthe only criticism i have relates to the server that i had on the first night a friend ordered a red stripe and the server looked disappointed my friend asked the server if he shouldn t order the beer and the server said that he probably wouldn t order a beer in this bar overall it felt very judgmental what the server didn t realize wa that my friend wa ordering a red stripe to have something to drink while he continued to look over the cocktail menu later on that night i asked the server about an ingredient in one of the cocktail and he answered confidently i later learned from the bartender that the info provided by the server wa incorrect i feel like a server should really know the cocktail inside and out in a bar like this especially if he recommends them over a beer i debated knocking the review down to star a a result of this but those interaction were rather brief and i feel like my overall experience wa overwhelming positive and that people should really try this place at least for the cocktail alone i am of jamaican decent this food taste pretty authentic this jamaican done with an upscale twist definitely worth a try for anyone who like food with a lot of flavor sat in the new bar and had me some rum nflight and vanilla mojito wa mighty yum yum na it raged down my throat and warmed my tum tum nmade my body go numb pervert hand now rubbing nmy baby s booty bum n nordered the appletin rum sea scallop next ndefinitely the best in the southwest with a spicy kick of zest nthe crispy mango fish roll which were only so so nstill craving dem scallop give me some mo give me some mo n ncurry chicken with dumpling wa my main meal ntexture is dense if you like that type of appeal ncomfort that ll make ya re invent the wigga wigga wheel nand kick off your hood rat heel n nboyfriend ordered the jerk chicken off da grill nfinger licking the last of his meal ndamn can i get a bite or do i have to steal nprices not too bad of a deal nthis rum ha got me coping a feel n nleaving room for some dessert nthe blue mountain coffee ha got me on full alert nman looking so good got a girl doing the slurp slurp nhe s trying not to get hurt na he reach for the sweet nlove n potato pudd n n noverall breadfruit wa the bomb nfelt like i wa in jamaica passing that bong a client of mine recently came to phoenix and the concierge at the renaissance recommended the breadfruit it wa almost embarrassing because the food wa awful and we left after beer and two appetizer do not waste your time a the flavor were terrible i meandered over to breadfruit on friday for lunch and though the owner and staff were incredibly nice and hospitable even took time to explain to me the theory behind ital the food just wasn t that good i wanted to like it i really did but my order of curried chicken with dumpling wa only edible the curried chicken wa delicious but the wheat dumpling that accompanied it barely qualified a food it wa a gooey cylindrical mess n ni liked the decor and ambiance of the restaurant but i don t think i d come back here unless it wa just for a side order of plantain mmm plantain did you that there are different type of rum i sure didn t but at the rum bar they have over different type of rum have a variety of drink to order i m sure you can go through the entire thing and never order the same drink twice crazy n ni have been on a coconut kick for a while now just love the flavor and the texture so i went with a pina colada it had matusalem platino rum pineapple kalani coconut liqueur and coconut let me tell you this wa very yummy if it wasn t a work night i would have ordered another one or two n nif pina coladas aren t for you they have many other drink to offer you it s a sweet little bar look forward going back we d heard of breadfruit and decided to stop by before st friday last week the design decor is fresh colorful and simple in a trendy kind of way the waitstaff is incredibly friendly and attentive and the kitchen is exposed so you can see your food being prepared they have traditional caribbean drink and fresh squeezed carrot juice with coconut and ginger the avocado chicken spring roll are tasty but could use a little more spice for dinner the chicken dumpling is delicious well the chicken is but the jerk shrimp plate is a bit sparse and overpriced for what you get overall we liked it and we ll be going back again to try some more dish this time we ll be sure to byob really unique sophisticated atmosphere the restaurant serf spicy jamaican cuisine and lot of rum we ordered an appetizer of calamari but it wa not the deep fried version rather it wa just grilled squid with a fruity floral sauce the appetizer ha won a few award and we know why squid usually ha a rubber like texture but the appetizer we had just melt in our mouth it wa definitely pricey for the amount you get but worth the experience of fresh squid at it finest i ordered the pulled pork over polenta i wasn t a fan of how smokey the pork wa but the meat itself wa very tender there wa way too much sauce poured over the polenta which made a weird texture but would have been great with out it my husband ordered a tropical fish dish which wa excellent i will definitely try this place again wasn t a fan of my dish but look forward to trying something else on the menu oh how i love delicious rum the wife and i went on an adventure through downtown the other night and stopped off at the rum bar for some late night cocktail the place is small and dimly lit and ha a whole wall of rum for tasting n nthe bartender wa very attentive and let u know that the rum bar wa still in their soft opening and invited u to their grand opening this week jan th i believe while we didn t eat he explained the food menu to u and noted how several item on the menu were very hot which we like very much n nnow on to the rum they have a whole wall of rum for tasting and mixing the most expensive of which wa buck a pour yikes all the ingredient are made fresh on site and all the fruit freshly squeezed each day just a couple of beer option and a couple of wine option but other than that it is only rum we had a few cocktail that were very enjoyable mojitos and hemingway all the way around and plan on returning often n noh and did i mention the super rad reggae and dub tune that were on the stereo anytime you hear a bob marley song in which bob or anyone else for that matter never even sings a note you know the dj know his reggae an awesome addition indeed n nif you like your rum this is definitely a place to check out just another super cool bar in the up and coming or entrenched downtown phoenix bar scene update grilled calamari is still on the menu but no longer served i m doing my best to separate rum bar from the breadfruit even tho the service is shared between the two although my original intention wa just to have a cocktail and experience the new bar our server wa super cool and told u about the special hearing about food on an empty stomach well i didn t have the willpower to say no n nlooking over the menu i noticed that there wa a grilled jerk chicken entree with i think potato at around our server described a similar special roasted jerk chicken with wild rice and vegetable so we opted for that one since she did an amazing job at describing it after being so hungry you d think that i d love whatever food i would get my way n nunfortunately the only thing good about my dish wa the server s description of it the dish wa half of a chicken with every single bone and skin still in there on top of rice there were tiny piece of vegetable which i couldn t even distinguish to a side the chicken wa spiced ok hot but not too much but it wa extremely dry and a giant pain to cut up after literally struggling with my dish for min i became frustrated and annoyed especially since every piece that i successfully managed to cut off the bone wasn t even that pleasing to the taste the rice wa just a ok not particular flavor and the dish just seemed like a regretful choice n nto make thing worse upon getting my receipt i see that my chicken special is whereas the chicken entre on the menu which is identical is that s it this restaurant is trying too hard to be fancy but not even delivering the quality and taste that a fancy restaurant should have n njust come here for drink do yourselves a favor and eat elsewhere have been to breadfruit twice now both time for drink and appetizer both time the greeting wa exceptional but do not expect much can do service while employee are nice and professional you will get nowhere asking for example for a virgin drink with no alcohol on both visit we had non drinker and simply asked if we could get one of their signature drink made with no booze it is almost a scripted answer no we do not do that certainly can understand this if the ingredient may have mix that also contain alcohol but come on with such remarkable mixologist jus ask them they will tell you it seems implausible that a non drinker could not be accommodated this wa a trend because on our first visit someone in our party asked if they could get a particular run drink made with a touch of ginger i believe that wa it and again no we do not do that really since when did a rum bar become a set in their way a a german deli it is a great place with we are sure great food we have just tried some bite and dessert but the ownership definitely need to relax a bit because you can almost see the waiter wanting to accommodate you but they apparently cannot this is review is not about the food the food wa great small portion n nthis review is about the server who sat our party we had a birthday party last night and we had two extra people join u she wa very rude about have those two extra people you would of thought we were not wanted doe she know people yelp n nshe finally sat u outside all split up this wa a tuesday night at no one wa even in that tiny restaurant the service wa ok they kept telling u there wa a charge for everything extra i m sorry but when you are paying per cocktail and for a piece of salmon i think bread should be free right olive garden n nour bill came to and i left still hungry n nthis is also a rum only bar who even like rum that much i stopped by the other night and i have to say it wa fun the curry were interesting and the stew were great it took a bit long for the food to get to our table but we had a great server and the owner wa such a nice guy that i really hope they do well because they come across a real genuine good people that care about what they do i think the place is cute clean and well put together try the meat patty and it s cool because it byob so be sure to bring your red stripe impeccable service authentic food i wa sooooo looking forward to a real mojito but sadly there s a serious lime shortage next time there will be a next time i ll stop by sprout bring my own lime now let me start by saying that this place ha the best rum collection i ve ever seen i had one of the best mojitos i ve ever had i also had a rum flight that wa buck pretty sweet now on to the service n nlook i get that it s busy and there s a lot going on i get it scout s honor i ve heard bad thing about the service here but didn t believe it could be that bad boy wa i wrong we sit at the bar and after minute or so we re able to order our drink not sooo bad but a little slow we start to notice several table approach the bar to either get their check or pay their check apparently they had been waiting quite some time i get halfway done with my drink and start thinking about getting a nd drink and a tilapia patty the bartender were busy working away making drink not bothering to check on u at all i don t want to be that jerk at the bar that s waving them down so i patiently wait and just try to make eye contact with them and wait and wait and wait and wait you get it right about minute go by and a top in the corner had to approach the bar to get menu and i had just decided to not get anything else finally about minute or so go by and we re able to get our check and escape again i understand being busy but c mon get your ish together yo n ni will go back hopefully this wa just an off night for them the food look great location s great decor s great and they have an epic rum collection i sure hope my next experience is better it been a couple year since i last set foot here and quite a bit ha changed went to rumbar recently but hadn t had a chance to check out the breadfruit and it updated menu until tonight the original place is still largely in tact but ha a distinctly refined look to it now it used to be just a hole in the wall type of place but it now feel like a really well rehearsed performance the food ha largely stayed the same with alot of the usual jerk and caribbean favorite on this night i went for the pimento wood smoked mussel good stuff though i wish i could ve had more the bean and rice were solid the bread wa delicious just a i remember and the drink from the rumbar were on point we topped off the evening with a chocolate creme brûlée my girlfriend wa a happy camper with that one overall the breadfruit ha definitely matured from it early beginning it still ha the feel of a neighborhood haunt but feel more like a sit down restaurant than a humble startup the price are a little on the high side with some of the dish and some of the cocktail are a little steep but overall i m very impressed with how breadfruit ha evolved must get hot buttered rum and a tasting flight n nsix month ago i began my love affair with rum i found out i would be working on the rum portfolio at diageo initially i thought i d prefer to work on tequila or whisk e y category i felt were more exciting i am happy to say i wa completely wrong the rum category still ha a perception problem it is so much more than fruity tropical drink and rum coke these drink have a time and place but there is an entire world out there experiencing traditional brown spirit cocktail with aged rum is divine the old fashioned or manhattan a well a replacing gin in a negroni a one example n ni m home for the holiday and wanted to check out the breadfruit rum bar in phoenix arizona there aren t many bar dedicated to rum dedicated mean there are no other spirit aside from rum yes they have red stripe and guinness beer yay diageo and select arizona wine but that is it they have a rum manifest that separate their rum into multiple category premium aged think zacapa or bacardi silver cane amber pyrat xo black gosling overproof gosling and cachaca ypioca they also have cigar rum pairing loved to see zacapa paired with arturo fuente a a cool feature you can even bring your own cigar to enjoy finally there are rum tasting flight naturally i had to get the one with zacapa xo the most expensive flight the grand reserve taping is with english harbour year old appleton estate year old and zacapa xo solera grand reserve n na my cocktail i got the hot buttered rum made with gosling s black seal house coconut liqueur butter cinnamon nutmeg and rum whip three type of rum dark rum coconut rum and rum whipped cream i mean come on dessert cocktail are always a favorite of mine so delicious n nthe bartender are the true star of this rum bar when i visited bryan and danielle were behind the bar they were patient and answered my many question about the back bar ingredient and whatever else i wanted to know about we sat at the bar when we visited this is always my preference i love engaging in conversation with such master of their craft n ni look forward to coming back here on my next visit home and sticking around for dinner the jamaican influenced menu look delicious whether you re a rum lover rum novice or just a lover of bar you must check out the rum bar at the breadfruit i really enjoy the food and cocktail there cocktail a long a you like rum order anything from the menu and you are in for a treat for the food i just love the jerk pork and polenta it ha a lovely kick to it the right amount of food i always feel nicely satisfied never heavy it is just a unique taste for phoenix so it make me happy nnow with that said the experience of going there take some getting used to first no matter what always make a reservation they are not busy all the time but they always ask you to take a seat and wait even if you have reservation but at least with reservation they don t tell you it is going to be mn even though the restaurant is half empty so there you ve been warned make a reservation take a seat it will be worth it the breadfruit ha always been one of my favorite i m always welcomed by name with hearty smile being a single woman party of one often this is the best place in town to feel comfortable and never alone n nalways a fan of the bar menu the new release of latest and greatest spring cocktail are stellar the french marmalade ha been haunting my dream for the last night after last evening though the smoked mussel will be doing battle with that cocktail for my dream ire mon truly ire i did not have a good experience at the rum bar you d think with a name look that they d be a little more laid back there were at most other couple inside dining and we wanted to dine outside another couple joined u but we had to sit at the bar until they arrived which is ridiculous once arrive we sat outside and ordered we then had another group of arrive who casually joined u on the patio to order a drink the waiter s approach wa abrupt and wa very offensive to our friend he could have easily set up another top and invited them to sit but he made them feel like they were in the way so they left we then paid our drink tab and left too we tried to speak with the owner but he wa on the phone rum bar should rethink their image and quick being so uppity and become a true rum bar the drink were only so so the waiter wa pretty rude and wa trying to tell u what to order when we didn t order what he recommended he seemed annoyed we ordered the seared scallop for an appetizer and they were not seared rather mushy the worst part of the meal wa the portion of my meal i ordered the special red snapper wrapped in a leaf of some sort i saw the couple at the table next to me eating it and their portion looked appropriate when i got my meal i had maybe ounce of fish a large piece of raw pineapple and some sort of a bread stick i don t know if the waiter wa trying to punish u for not ordering enough cocktail but i have never had a portion so small not even in paris made reservation at on a saturday and waited maybe three minute to be seated the place wa busy but wasn t crowded however by every table wa pretty much full glad we made our reservation our waitress grace wa kind and gave great option for drink and entree i had the shim sham drink at the beginning and my husband and i ordered two of the avocado and plantain roll for appetizer so yum for the entree we both ordered the jerk chicken with rice and veggie and that too wa great nthe place is worth a visit although it s small it ha a great vibe to it my advice make reservation grab some drink and sit back and enjoy your company neverybody around u seemed happy we had a great experience so i know we will definitely be back i ll keep this short and sweet n nyes i believe they only carry rum and limited beer red stripe anyone if i m mistaken someone correct me but that s all i seemed to see n nyes you should still go here no matter what your alcoholic preference is n nand dear god yes you should drink a dark and stormy and then one more rum bar interesting i guess this restaurant try to push varied rum drink to coincide with different part of the meal like wine pairing at a fine restaurant however i am not sure that multiple rum drink necessarily bode well for the drive home n nregardless that is the least of this restaurant s problem service is poor and the food wa worse all four of the people in my party received food that wa not hot presumably because the waitress let the food sit in the kitchen too long when ready when she wa told our food wasn t hot her reply wa that she would yell at the chef not improve our circumstance nadditionally my jerk chicken wa dry and overdone a well a no longer hot n nbreadfruit and rum bar too cute poorly managed and bad food preparation no thanks i wa looking dinner and came across this restaurant a it wa not far from my hotel a i walked in it s pretty small inside the bar is well stacked and had a nice menu to choose from something for everyone s palette i sat inside a it wa a little too hot outside the waitress offered her suggestion a she figured out this wa my first time dining at the establishment i felt the atmosphere wa very classy to start i had a punch bowl in which they change that drink daily it wa amazing the plantain a the appetizer and the red fish a my entree those two dish were great in taste a twist on the caribbean favor very fresh it wa just not enough food i do not eat a lot and i wa still hungry after the meal i did order dessert the something sweet potato that wa very good and a nice portion i take off one star with the fact that they barely give you enough food for the price my gf give it a but i think it is closer to a so this post is a the menu is a bit limiting i have eaten a fair amount of caribbean food and i while i thought this place wa good for phoenix i wa not all that impressed most of the food wa tasty but the vegetable side that came with the meal were just cabbage and simple pepper wtf no flavor and the dumpling looked like something i wouldn t want anywhere near my food it nearly spoiled my appetite and maybe they shouldn t stress how much everything is localy grown and organic it s a jamaican restaurant in phoenix how local could it be well that point wa answered when our waiter had to clarify the locality of a few item one more thing what is up with the bottle opening fee i wa going to bring a bottle until i read that n ni am sure to eat here again if the menu change seasonally and they introduce some new item throughout the year i will probably revise my review to be a little more favorable if nothing change i will take the rating to a i have been to the breadfruit rum bar a couple of time now the first time wa several week ago and i didn t have any expectation i wa pleasantly surprised to find that the food wa outstanding the staff wa friendly and accommodating and the atmosphere wa warm and inviting fast forward a few week to visit number two unlike the first visit my expectation were very high based on my previous experience i wa delighted when those expectation were not just met but were exceeded thus far everything i have tried on the menu ha been excellent the salmon is off the chart delicious and highly recommended also do yourself a solid and save room for the sweet potato pie for desert this ha quickly become my favorite restaurant in phoenix can t wait for my next visit the drink are unique and tasty the environment is warm and inviting the food is very good it is a great place for a date spectacular everything wa good bartender wa an expert in his craft even enjoyed a nice cigar out on the patio despite the july heat will come here again every time i m in town i ve only been once but i m looking forward to going back the bartender are engaging and fun the drink are fantastic but the food wa just okay granted i have limited option due to dietary health restriction but i think i ll probably eat elsewhere before going for drink of course i ll give them another try first but for the price point i wa expecting something more exciting n nin addition to fun staff the atmosphere is wonderful definitely feel like an upscale tiki bar i also think it s fantastic that they re participating in ethical sourcing of their fish i don t eat fish for the record but if i did i d be glad to know where it came from and that s information they can provide yummy joint great fun fun atmosphere cool vibe nothing to over the top but great place for drink and or dinner apps island fusion fare a in caribbean nice decor very romantic and intimate patio seating out front and a cigar bar out back if you smoke cigar and we don t nhad no idea it wa reservation strongly suggested but they accommodated u at the bar nall rum based cocktail and the one i had wa super tasty they have quite the mixologist on hand i had a fish dish it wa good small portion for the price nbeen wanting to try this place for some time glad i did but a little pricey for what we were expecting this place wa amazing food wa so full of flavor and very fresh and local we were expecting caribbean food but not this good jerk chicken wa so good who knew rice could be so flavorful pepper shrimp so spicy wonderlish we will definitely be back reservation needed a very full even in summer star for rum bar for breadfruit bar wa out of ginger beer which eliminated the best cocktail on the menu those that i tried instead were just ok but interesting cocktail menu with decent happy hour option at i agree with the prior review on breadfruit quality food authentic menu good service but higher price than what you d expect good tune on the playlist and a good first date place awesome concept with consistent quality but i just wish there wa a bit more too it n ntheir drink are very good but your choice are limited to either straight rum or whatever few drink they have decided that they are going to make on that particular day i find it incredibly odd that a rum bar won t serve a mai tai everyday of the week n nthe food is very good flavorful but the choice are limited the menu doesnt change much so i dont have an inclination to return and eat the same thing again n nservice is good pricing is fair decor is nice classy and the restaurant is small so you better make a reservation i am defnitley a fan and i ve eaten there twice in the last few year most recently this past weekend no complaint at all about the taste of the food price bang for the buck ratio not so much n nwe had the fish roll today s catch spinach with a sauce i would have thought wa jerk waitress said it wasn t and pickled mango n nwe also ordered plantain and the jerk chicken dish everything wa fresh and tasy portion are much smaller than i would have expected the plantain i think were five piece totally minimal seasoning and wa expecting it to be more crispy n nfish roll dipping sauce paste wa so good i asked for some more to have with my chicken waitress said no i wa a little pissed they say they make everything fresh and in small batch and she brought be out some mixture of onion peppercorn and habanero in vinegar wtf n ngrilled jerk chicken wa great small breast piece fresh seasoning similar to paste but more spicy grilled pineapple jicama and a corn n the cob ndessert with the local ice cream and sweet potatoe cake thing wa also tasty ni just glanced at aileen b s review she ordered same stuff and said the same thing maybe owner will read these consider some change chicken breast can be had for buck a pound so a larger piece wouldnt kill them and the bananna cookin it a little more would make sense maybe add some kind of rub or spice desert wa great a well we ordered mojito and i think the hurricane also tasy felt like scottsdale price but under dollar for decent drink i wasnt impressed with the mojito like azcentral wa that rated it best in phx next time maybe spend more time in rum bar next door and eat elsewhere to fill me up upon the recommendation of another downtown restauranteur my wife and i checked out breadfruit and the attached rum bar what a terrific suggestion thanks cibo nwe were staying at the clarendon hotel and so we light railed it downtown super easy and got there early to hang out in the bar for a while dwayne met u at the door and got u settled at the bar kristin wa our bartender for the evening good thing too since i had no idea there were so many rum and rum drink and so little time we placed ourselves in her capable hand and she paired drink with our food all night long we started a scallop appetizer perfectly prepared and i had the tradewinds swizzle my wife had the hemingway daiquiri which turned out to be her favorite drink of the night after some time at the bar we moved to the dining room for a fantastic supper i started with soup of the day then on to the jerk chicken fantastic kristen wa true to her word and provided some really tasty drink to go along with our equally tasty meal nwe ll definitely return for more of their delicious fare heard great thing from several people so we decided to give it a go after the scallop app my mouth is on fire i like spicy food when it s not so hot it burn or lingers several water and minute later still on fire not pleasant hard to enjoy the food when it burn the rest tasted good not overly impressed small portion lot of flavor peppery jerk spicey loud and hot inside summer and had a fly buzzing around we couldn t seem to get rid of i can see why folk like it but it s a bit limited and spicey for my taste i won t be coming back too many other great place in phx to try and go back to n ni wa refraining from alcohol from the evening so can t comment on the drink so my rating is strictly on the food love the ambiance n nthe small plate and entree selection we ate were very good delicious sea bass with a lovely presentation ceviche plantain spring roll loved the rum punch with ginger the back patio is relaxing and lends itself to small group discussion unfortunately our waiter wa a little awkward he tended to come ask how wee were doing when we were clearly in a deep discussion when he did so he tended to try to make small talk and attempt humor by the time he understood we didn t need anything and walked away we were hard pressed to pick up our conversation where we left off n ni still recommend this restaurant amazing food and ambiance our server christian walked u through the menu and helped u order yet perfect drink and meal she wa a wonderful guide everything we ordered wa outstanding great cocktail but the atmosphere is very condescending and unpleasant i brought a group of about people for a happy hour and a people trickled in we were repeatedly asked if we had a larger group coming when the full party had arrived we were asked to sit in the back patio i e smoking section which wa not a nice thing to do to my non smoking friend where there wa no seating for group larger than i want to be clear none of u had had anything to drink before our arrival we were not belligerent we were not rude we were just treated that way n nwe were also given conflicting message about substituting different variety of rum in the cocktail and were charged absurdly for the privilege of doing so until we were told it wa impossible because we would single handedly ruin the owner s entire brand n nall in all it s a good place to go for a cocktail they re tasty but it wa easier and more pleasant to do business elsewhere i haven t gone back and i have no intention of doing so i m giving this place star for two reason n n i am reviewing the rum bar and not the restaurant else the rating would go down n i am writing this review after my last experience with a le than stellar bartender n nso let s start with the bad first i think rum bar s popularity is outgrowing their space which isn t a bad thing we just didn t have enough room to chill the other night no big deal n nmore importantly i ve seen three bartender at rum bar i believe beth and dwayne were the first to bartender i ve dealt with and to say they are amazing and know their stuff is an understatement they know their rum all or so variety they know their cigar and damn it they know how to make a good drink unfortunately their work is overshadowed by the new guy whose name i never learned his drink weren t bad but his abruptness cockiness and attitude sucked all the magic out of the place n nok enough of the bad now to the good the atmosphere although small is great a nice dimly lit cozy bar area is a good place to cool off or warm up depending on the season but if it summer or otherwise nice out hit up some of the many adirondack chair and bench outside if it s a little warm the mister will overtake the patio in a good way n nbut seriously the rum is responsible for half the namesake of this downtown gem get some any of their specialty cocktail listed on the menu are expertly created never too sweet never too strong you will taste the alcohol and the complete essence of the drink not sure what you want snag one of those two awesome bartender who double a server within the bar and patio and tell them what s on your mind branch out try something new n nsee you at the rum bar three of u ate here last night and i ll definitely go back the service wa great emily wa fantastic and so helpful even when i called to get direction and the owner daryl stopped by our table after the meal to make sure everything wa alright what a nice guy ni guess if i had a critique to make it would be that the appetizer should be larger they re very inexpensive so in retrospect we should have ordered two or three of the avacado spring roll and empanadas but i would have preferred them to be priced a two or three instead of one nother than that the food wa great i ordered the curried tofu excellent choice and cleaned the plate martha ordered the jerk chicken hot hot hot and binnie ordered the chicken and dumpling which wa unique and really tasty nall three of u said that we d definitely go back again the short and skinny is to come here for drink and dine elsewhere the drink are expensive but they are all unique and pretty well executed my karrots wa a mix of carrot juice pimento and ginger with rum i liked the overall flavor and the boozy level but i felt that it needed more spice and definitely more ginger since i didn t taste it at all n nmy friend s kiwi drink wa very sweet but very well executed and perfect if you just want sweet drink not something i could order repetitively n nfinally my friend s piña colada wa like a dessert super creamy and indulgent but enough to slowly get you drunk without you noticing n nthe one big big fault on their part is that they don t make caipirinhas what you have a giant bar solely dedicated to rum you carry different type of cachaca brazilian rum but you don t make caipirinhas that s a silly a silly get folk i mentioned it to the server and she told me that they may put it back on the menu i hope they do what can i say went here for lunch i really liked the place and god know it fill a very vacant niche in the phoenix restaurant market but i l know nothing good every come after but i really like you but n nhmmm i ordered the jerk chicken i wa very excited i love jerk chicken but it wa dry i have only been there once so take my review with a grain of salt however jerk chicken ha got to be the signature carribean entree so they gotta execute will i go back absolutely i really did like the place will i oder the jerk chicken again probably not the rum punch is ridiculously amazing at a glass during happy hour it just keep you wanting more and more and more reserved a table for a birthday n ngot to the venue they had no idea who we were neither a table ready n nfood wa ok rum wa great n nnote they do not split bill and charge you per plate if you bring a birthday they almost refused allowing u to eat the cake in the restaurant incase it contaminated their food the scallop and rum old fashioned are pretty bomb n nhowever the service is a joke drink take at least minute and scott s is rude he ha an attitude when you order and when i handed him my drink with broken glass he wa upset that i didn t want to keep it n nnot a repeat place the food wa ok although the price point wa a little high i wa one of a group of nine we were having a great time until the bill the server spring on u that he can only accept two credit card that wa very inconvenient especially since he didn t tell u until we were paying like i said we were people and were pretty much the only people there during their lunch hour i wa surprised they were not more accomodating although we all enjoyed our food for the most part we all decided we would not return i love breadfruit the last time i went in i wa bummed to see they weren t carrying my favorite bok choy dish any longer maybe it wa seasonal but the food wa fantastic a wa the vegan dessert if i lived closer i would go here at least weekly cute atmosphere great music and wonderful food went here for my birthday dinner with my family the star of the meal wa definitely the drink the rum punch wa perfection thank god i had the delicious hot buttered rum for dessert a the sweet potato pie wa not my favorite service wa stellar the meal wa slow paced which wa nice for a relaxing night with the fam would probably return for more rum i highly recommend this place the food is phenomenal and the drink are absolutely amazing the bartender ryan and eric are artist behind the bar and extremely knowledgeable about every aspect of their menu it definitely a paradise for every rum or seafood lover nthank you for the wonderful service i will be back again i went to bf a while back thought the food wa just ok the way my friend i were treated when we showed up a few minute before our reservation wa a true slap in the face they were completely rude told u to wait in the hallway near the bathroom until our table wa ready what wa interesting is that there were only a few patron in the restaurant i m a huge foodie and recommend many establishment to my client and this one is definately off the list i don t care how good your food is but if the service is bad i will never return there are too many great restraunts in the phoenix area with great service and great food to waste my hard earned money at a place like bread fruit when we arrived to this mostly empty restaurant there wa a party of and a party of that were told to wait for their table we were told to wait a well even though a you look around the restaurant and front patio were empty we were told we could not sit on the empty front patio since it is reserved for dining guest only that is fine but again after we left we still saw a bunch of empty table on the front patio we saw the person party finally get seated on the empty table after about minute same deal with u a we were escorted on the tiny completely empty back patio lounge chair our waiter wa very good and wa a relief to see good service after dealing with the pretentious host when we asked about ordering appetizer now we were told we were not allowed to eat on the back patio even though it wa completely empty besides u too many rule not customer friendly almost feel like they are trying too hard to give the feel of an actual busy highly sought after restaurant owner should reconsider the incompetent host and all of his silly game they called to confirm which wa good a i then had the phone handy a the show we were at ran longer after starting later than we anticipated they graciously accommodated u party of great specialty cocktail and the food did not disappoint a usual i had the molasses lollipop which were pretty delicious and are actually chicken and a fabulous punch however the waitstaff wa kind of icy although the bartender wa very friendly and everything wa overpriced i d go back if someone asked me to but it s not somewhere i ll choose to frequent i went to the rumbar for the first time yesterday and i wa not disappointed the bar staff wa the epitome of mixology i could have spent a few hour watching them expertly craft drink alone they have one drink the shorty that requires lighting a sage leaf on fire then covering it with a glass to add smoke flavor to it pure genius whomever came up with these recipe i applaud you the food wa delicious with lot of flavor i highly recommend the daily catch and the fish spring roll the cocktail are a must if you visit the mixologist can recommend libation based on palate there s an authentic jamaican restaurant in phoenix yes you can re read what i wrote there is an authentic jamaican restaurant in phoenix we had the jamaican jerk chicken and it wa soooo spicy which wa exactly what we wanted the place is small but it s quaint that way i love when they have music and i heard the rum bar is amazing i haven t been since that opened but i will now that i read the other review a rum drink and a spicy jamaican jerk chicken sound divine in phoenix no le make reservation for weekend we met some friend here last night for dinner and drink despite not having reservation a this wa a last minute occasion the manager owner squeezed u in and i thoroughly appreciate it he definitely made u feel like valued guest n nour server christian wa absolutely lovely she kept our drink filled and put up with our juvenile antic all night long give this girl a raise n nthe cocktail were delicious the pina colada wa stunning it is not your margarita machine jimmy buffet esque frozen beverage it s a real deal colada with coconut cream coconut rum and a whole lot of yummy i also tried the rum punch they make a new one every day so it s always changing it wa outstanding and i think it s probably good that it come in small class i m pretty sure it s dangerous n nthe food wa honestly underwhelming my jerk shrimp wa spiced well and i believe they were good quality prawn but they were overcooked and chewy my husband s jerk pork suffered the same fate of being dry he did enjoy the polenta that came with it n ni wouldn t pause for a second to come back here for drink but i would probably dine elsewhere the breadfruit ha delicious and had a wonderful atmosphere i had the scallop which gordon ramsey say they are difficult to make but you would never think that when you come here they were slightly spicy yet provided a delicate flavor the jerk chicken salad wa a little hot for my taste and lacked a little salt with that being said i loved the fresh fruit in the salad i am a vodka drinker but wa eager to try their rum drink i am sure glad that i did our bartender wa extremely knowledgable about the restaurant their culture and picked what is now my favorite cocktail the shim sham i absolutely recommend this place just bring your wallet a the drink are and the food is greater than know what spice your palate can handle super small very intimate worth at least one visit also home of the tiniest bathroom sink ever n nwe went here for a friend birthday a few weekend ago a reservation is highly recommended since they are so tiny our waitress recommended we try rum bar house made punch yum n nnow ive never had jamaican food before but im now officially a fan a a table we shared the best mussel ive had since diving for them ourselves in new england a a kid for the main course i had the jerk prawn holy spicy batman so good my husband is notoriously picky about his food but he rather enjoyed the molasses fried lollipop he got overall everyone wa very pleased w their food choice n nour waitress wa very attentive and knowledgeable and the atmosphere wa very unassuming and chill n nif youre in the mood for something a little different i recommend going here i wa so disappointed in my experience at this restaurant now reading some of the review i guess it is normal for this place so i also will not be back i came on a tuesday evening by myself i also wa asked to sit and wait i guess they do that to everyone they wanted me to sit at the bar and i guess i should have in hindsight or just left but i wa interested in the food anyway they sat me at a table that wa practically in the kitchen the restaurant wa mostly empty i think there were other table occupied the server didn t care that i wa uncomfortable server kept swishing by very close to me which wa awful a wa the noise from the banging in the kitchen i mentioned it time and the third time he said no worry a i sat there eating and being treated like a second class citizen at the time i thought it wa because i wa alone i got more and more upset because none of the other table ever filled up so i guess maybe it s one of their rule that if you re alone you sit at the worst table in the place the other thing is they push you to have these mixed rum drink with your dinner which i didn t want i wa told they have two wine both az wine ok i chose the white which wa ok until it warmed up a little then it wa pretty bad i had the scallop appetizer which wa the only good part of the night my jerk chicken wa in a sweet sauce that wasn t good all in all it wa not just a bad experience it wa insulting and i would not recommend you spend your time or money here year downtown and breadfruit rum bar is still my favorite restaurant downtown the closest experience i can get to being back in nyc always fresh ingredient and locally sourced veggie n nthe mood and environment can t be found anywhere else in phoenix the scallop are still my favorite appetizer while the seasonal drink and entree menu keep the experience new n nbut favorite are the pork belly red stripe shrimp and street style chicken are always consistent the yellow tail catch of the day wa phenomenal n nrelax enjoy freshly made drink with edible condiment perhaps have a cigar in the courtyard even with mister in degree heat at night n nit s a tried and true downtown phoenix experience i loved it great food definitely the service wa a good a it get i loved their drink and the atmosphere is laid back and cosy definitely returning but will make a reservation this time around very tasty appealingly decorated and tiny the jerk chicken wa not overly spiced but had a nice little unexpected kick to it the cocunut curried tofu wa excellent great food great service bring your own wine and people that love food and you ll have great time must try the carrot juice trust me n nonly metered street parking and the meter are hour bring change and be prepared to run out and feed the meter on the upside you can see the street from any table so you can keep an eye out for the meter reader came for cigar drink on the back patio service wa top notch and by god were the mixed drink tasty not your traditional mixed drink either wa very impressed with what i ordered shim sham would come back for a nightcap again n nside note the host wa a little odd noticed that mentioned in a few review he had u sit and wait to be taken back to an empty patio oh well minor inconvenience the rum drink are creative and delicious even my prego friend who got a fruit juice concoction wa impressed with the tastiness of her beverage nthumbs up cute place that is tucked into a side street quaint on the inside and staff wa very informative red snapper wa good but the plantain were the highlight walking distance to symphony hall and other spot i really wanted to like the place more than i did n nfirst off i reserved a table tuesday for a thursday night just in case when we arrived they didn t have my name anywhere not that it mattered apparently because after waiting minute we were escorted to the dining area which had many open table so then why the delay n nthe wait staff wa friendly and knowledgeable recommending several drink appetizer and entree and didn t do the usual upsell of recommending the most expensive thing so kuddos there the plantain were excellent the cocktail a bit pricey for a small glass would probably have ordered more if they were closer to the range it s a psychological thing to be sure n nbut anyway i decided to go for broke and order the curried lamb the most costly entree on the menu i love lamb and don t get it often so i usually order it if i see it on a menu but i wa very disappointed when it arrived it tasted wonderful don t get me wrong but the portion so tiny literally chop bite per chop i ve had much larger just a succulent and delicious at a much better price at other restaurant when i looked at the amount of food others including my date were receiving for almost dollar le it wa tough not to be annoyed i spent most dollar and left hungry n ncannot say i would return anytime soon a many time a ive been to the breadfruit im surprise i haven t written a review for it yet this is my favorite restaurant to go to you can find me and my girlfriend there at least once a month a we both enjoy the place very much i enjoy the look of the place alot it not big and fancy hell you could easily pas right by it and not even notice it there but that all add to the charm of the breadfruit and make it seem like it a secret place that only you and whoever you are dining with know about it also a romantic place for a date the painting on the wall are for sale it can get a bit loud when it get filled only because the place is small but that s a minor gripe when my girlfriend and i go she get the brown stew chicken i get either the curry chicken and dumpling or the jerk chicken and i don t even like spicy food that much but the jerk chicken is so good i love it quote me on what im about to say the breadfruit ha some of the best and strongest drink i love their drink there because they are never watered down the first sip of your drink may seem pretty overwhelming but don t worry it just the alcohol telling your tastebud to wake the hell up the drink are smooth and very tasty and you just taste a hint of alcohol in the drink even though they put alot in them which ive always thought wa good when the alcohol doesn t overpower the taste of the drink the dark stormy regular or the dark stormy are my drink of choice highly recommend either one of those one more thing whatever you order make sure you get a side of festival bread i don t care if your meal already come with it order a side anyway it very delicious bread a dinner for a couple average between if u just get dinner and a couple drink but if you just get dinner and no drink then it between wow i initially thought this place would be a super casual run of the mill caribbean inspired diner type restaurant but i wa way wrong after being greeted by an elegant gentleman i immediately noticed the cool red stripe pendant light hanging over the bar ripe with a fine selection of rum and other libation offering after finding this place on opentable for a new year eve dinner again i wasn t anticipating or even necessarily wanting a five star experience but i m pleased to say that s what we had however the only reason this isn t a star review is because i wa a bit taken aback by the fact that their pre fixe menu wasn t advertised properly before i made the reservation so we spent a great deal more than we anticipated to on one meal despite that my beau and i enjoyed one of each from the option and also opted in for the cocktail pairing sure enough everything wa absolutely amazing and my favorite dish will probably the soup and the swordfish i look forward to visiting this place on an average night and i m grateful for the great service and delicious dish the restaurant is a bit cramped but they make good use of the space the host seemed very busy and not very engaging with the customer almost robot like the presentation of the food wa good but the flavor wa just ok i ve had lot of jerk chicken in my year and i like the more authentic spicy jerk chicken the jerk chicken here is more like the american style jerk chicken which is basically bbq chicken with a kick overall it wasn t bad but it definitely could be better the owner wa great he let u sit at the bar asking patron to move to make room for the four of u without a reservation once we sat the bartender helped u to choose drink and food hand down some of the best jamaican food i have eaten the owner even suggested a great pairing for my escavitch fish the daiquiri agricole wa strong and an excellent pair to the spicy fish n nthis place wa so good we recommended it to other friend who went later that night but because it wa late they had already run out of some of their menu item so i might suggest getting an earlier reservation so you get a chance to try the plantain and the fresh food go early this place is small and fill fast i had a chance to check this place out before going out and about on first friday in february and i wa quite disappointed the concept of the bar is awesome and the drink sounded great but the overall execution wa terrible really this rating is completely based on service and maybe i should give it star a their drink are very good but that s about it n nupon arriving at breadfruit rum bar we were told to sit anywhere in the bar area and someone would be around to serve u there were about or so people in the whole place restaurant and bar so it didn t seem that busy however it took about minute before someone came over to take our drink order or even acknowledge our group not a good sign n nafter we made our order or estate mai tai dark and stormy mojito ponganot and french caribbean breeze two of which were the server bar keeper suggestion we waited and checked out the decor the ambiance inside is dark and relaxed but made reading the menu almost impossible others around u and our group were using cell phone to try and read the menu it wa so dark i get trying to give a place a vibe but can we get a little bit of light to read n ndrinks arrive these were amazing i had very high expectation given the selection of rum and narrative behind everything we ordered but wa still impressed drink were well blended and decently strong the mai tai wa off the chart and might have kicked my as had i gotten another n nwhich brings u to the next drink that never happened our server bar keep came by mid way through our cocktail and asked if we wanted a second order but given the time it wa taking u to get through the first one three of u waited and one ordered a red stripe n n minute pas and most of u are either done or close enough to order another but no server drink done and our group is waiting for another minute no red stripe and no second order what the hell now we are sitting around waiting just to see how long it take but after more minute we give up and go to the bar to get our tab more minute go by and we finally have our bill but there is no breakdown of what we ordered it s just part of good service to always bring a breakdown of the bill and we were curious to see if the red stripe we ordered and never got wa on there sure enough after more minute of waiting to get a breakdown of the bill there wa the unicorn red stripe getting that off the bill wa another minute and finally we were allowed to leave n ni m not sure what happened that evening but there is no reason for poor service the place wa not that busy and they were clearly not understaffed based on the amount of staff roaming around the staff seemed preoccupied with assisting those sitting directly at the bar instead of the lounge seating behind the bar stool and the bar appeared to be getting great service i ll give it another try for the drink and sit at the bar but it s with hesitation and low expectation of service amazing food lick your plate amazing truly this is a definite date night restaurant located in the heart of downtown phoenix by the asu campus this quaint caribbean inspired restaurant ha a rum bar and a fresh daily new rum cocktail to enjoy everything is delicious i ve been here about time and have never been disappointed reservation strongly recommended considering this place ha such good review on yelp i thought i d love it but i really didn t i typically love jamaican ingredient and dish but the food just wasn t that great and we tried an appetizer scallop and dish the tofu and special of the night which wa snapper so disappointing n nthe drink were really spectacular however carrot and some other fruit which i forgot rum bar great vibe a touch higher class for those not familiar with rum rum connoisseur step up and bring your a game n nowner duane is knowledgable and approachable to discus rum history science and experience bartender brian is accommodating and the music is on a cool vibe no dancehall here all old school hit n nsalt fish fritter are good but small and rice pea are good no experience with dinner menu but heard food wa good from patron we spoke to n noverall cool spot awesome atmosphere inside and sitting on the patio the food is so tasty i d recommend the shrimp dish the fruit punch bowl which is made fresh daily service is great and i will be back portion are small so if you eat larger amount or are overly hungry you ll want to order several appetizer the scallop were delicious mojitos perfection our service wa excellent and we were quite pleased with our experience my only gripe is that they try to squeeze too many people in a very small space and they should let people know they have a dress code this is arizona and your in the middle of downtown phoenix with a large college population however i like the idea of getting dressed for dinner personally but to be told that one of my dinner guest couldnt sit in the dining area cause he wa wearing a tank top a little off putting since we had been sitting there waiting for a table and had made reservation that info coulda been given excellent jerk prawn the seasoning wa perfect and while they were spicy they weren t so spicy i couldn t enjoy the meal the side the prawn were served with were good a well coleslaw grilled corn breadstick the beverage they offer here are wonderful a well while i wa initially wary of getting carrot juice the carrot juice they offer here is slightly sweet from the addition of raw sugar creamy and the nutmeg they added gave it a very nice flavor the pink ting grapefruit soda is also quite tasty a well a the refreshing apple cider locally produced n nduring our meal the waiter strongly suggested that we order the bean and rice with the jerk entree i tasted some of the rice and bean from my husband s entree brown stew chicken which tasted ok nothing special if it is so strongly suggested to add the bean and rice to the entree why isn t it included automatically in the entree then n nminus some point for naming your restaurant breadfruit but not having breadfruit on the menu it s like calling your restaurant kentucky fried chicken but not offering any chicken p i didn t know what to expect but had a great experience here very thoughtful menu and cocktail program both of which were thankfully well outside of the typical new american phoenix menu where of the menu is the same everywhere good service and ambiance i have been to the breadfruit a couple time i ve always enjoyed it i wa sadly a little turned off this last time because of our server we ate on the rum bar side he wa the bartender and i have just never dealt with a more pushy waiter he basically forced my friend to order their drink special and then would not stop talking about the scallop i seriously thought he wa just going to order them for u it really took me aback don t push so hard dude n nwe split the plantain and avocado spring roll awesome we both decided on the jerk shrimp salad which wa also really great i ve had their chicken fish and those damn scallop and they were all good all drink are based with rum so if you like rum uh duh n ni think my favorite thing there is their french press coffee served with a little coconut milk you barely need it their fresh carrot juice is delicious too believe me n ni guess overall a nice place to grab drink or dinner if you re in downtown phoenix just please breadfruit lay off if i don t want something i don t want it don t try to talk to me about it for more minute to convince me i think keeping your customer is more important than one up sell i came in with a group of friend for dinner today margaret wa our server the food wa great i wasn t very impressed with the plantain i m used to them being a little more cooked i ate the curried coconut tofu which a pretty good the drink are a must do the mojitos were excellent along with the black cherry mango punch i m not a fan of either fruit but i did like the punch i can t feel my tongue n ni didn t know that jerk chicken translated to spice with a little chicken on the side i admit that i have sensitive taste bud when it come to spicy food but this stuff wa way off my spicy food odometer i would say it wa flavorful but my tastebud were so numb after the chicken i couldn t tell n nhowever i did enjoy everything else the bread that come with your meal is a festival on the menu but it s darn good and perhaps the thing to save you should the jerk chicken be too much i ordered the shrimp on the side of my jerk chicken but i think i just got trigger happy one dish and and appetizer is already plenty so if the waitress suggests a side of shrimp i say pas n ndefinitely get the plaintain avocado spring roll interesting texture and taste plus the mango salsa on the side is quite refreshing speaking of refreshing i highly recommend the sorrel to drink it s a hibiscus tea and rum blend but you can t even taste the rum mmm perfect way to beat the phoenix heat n ncute little restaurant with brightly colored wall which is a welcome change from the red brown and tan building outside i came here while i wa on a business trip and it s walking distance from all the downtown hotel i wish i had room for dessert but i wa stuffed i m sad not to offer this place a star review because i sure wanted to going for drink hit up the rum bar same place and you won t be disappointed not that you d be disappointed by the food you just won t feel the same wow factor you get from the drink n neverything they make is good you simply can t deny that n nvalue not so much sure most plate are in the range but they are small if just enough the wait staff is friendly but almost in the used car salesman way upsell yep at every course i usually walk out between before drink never disappointed but i wouldn t go there for food unless someone specifically wanted to yummy jamaican food and specialty rum drinkscute spot for date night not a very big place and we did make reservation through open table but i think we would have been ok if we didn t definitely recommend reservation for a larger group though food drink are not moderately priced staff wa very friendly first off my review is for the rum bar we didn t make it to the restaurant our first impression wa not great and i hope i can update my review soon the bar only sell rum cocktail not a rum drinker but i had read that the bartender are awesome and can pair their cocktail to your liking bartender zero wa rude shamed u for suggesting that he recommend one of their cocktail that would compare to a manhattan he wa borderline obnoxious fortunately nick saved the day explained the menu and helped me pick out a cocktail one of my friend tried their punch of the day but the other half of our party wa so put off by the initial bartender they refused to order so our stay wa cut short in the end i really liked my cocktail but getting there wa a little dramatic i thought the scene wa cool so i will definitely go again after i make sure bartender zero is not working if you love rum go here huge selection of high end rum and all craft cocktail on menu are rum based very knowledgable bar staff can walk you through selection ninteresting menu i haven t had dinner here in a few year so dont think it is fair for me to rate however we had the smoked trout app and that wa light and declious nunique bar and restaurant in the heart of downtown worth a stop in i definitely want to sit on the cute back patio when it cool down review update n nchanged to star i ve visited this place more often and have had nothing but good experience the owner seems to be always present and ha greeted u personally every time we come in they have good food good drink and good service what else can i say the breadfruit is an intimate little restaurant that s perfect for a date we like the atmosphere but have mix feeling about the food we started with the scallop for you only get two scallop it wa delicious so we were excited about the entree unfortunately they didn t live to our expectation the jerked chicken in the salad and the escovitch fish grouper were bland the escovitch fish wa not worth the portion wa small price wa high and the fish needed salt we left still feeling hungry six year later we went back and assumed it improved the service and drink were still good but no improvement on the food we ordered the escovitch bass fish while waiting we noticed a brothy dish wa taken away hmmm did we make a mistake coming here the fish came out it looked good but wa small and salty the cherry vinegar and sweet bread stick were suppose to offset the saltiness but we don t like mixing the fish should be good on own just a fyi eating a small whole fish is messy because you have to deal with bone came here while at a conference downtown because it came up on the result for vegetarian in phoenix it didn t disappoint both the soy chunk curry and the pop cho were very tasty a were the avocado and plantain spring roll we got i d expected them to be raw cold but they were good fried and hot n nalso the my favorite carrot juice is delicious i may try to replicate it at home in the event i ever get a juicer the sorrel wa good too felt so bad walked into this place with a huge group right when they were doing last call but what did they do the staff made it happen the waitress treated u wonderfully and immedietly told u the special i m not a huge rum person at all but the signature drink she offered me wa delicious the astmosphere wa great very cute spot n n rum bar is definitely worth checking out i m all about new hot spot in downtown phoenix i ve had this establishment bookmarked on yelp for some time now and finally had the chance to check it out this weekend i had high hope that this place would be amazing or at the very least full of authentic caribbean flavor while the experience wasn t horrible it wasn t exactly good either n nthe restaurant itself is fairly small and can get quite loud due to poor acoustic not ideal for a romantic date date although i thought it did have potential the service wa fantastic and some of the cocktail that we ordered were decent the rum old fashioned in particular wa delicious most of the other cocktail we tried were too sweet syrupy for my liking n nthe food wasn t bad but wasn t great for apps we ordered the scallop which were probably the highlight of the entire meal the jerk shrimp and johnny cake were a bit bland we both ordered the pork and polenta a main since they were out of the brown stew beef brisket which wa my first choice the pork tasted like regular bbq pulled pork and not the best version of it that i ve ever had it had a nice smokey flavor but if i wanted bbq i would have just gone to bbq for dessert they only had one option the sweet potato pudding pie it wa absolutely awful i have never met a dessert that i did not like and usually i enjoy sweet potato and always love coconut so i wa shocked that we didn t even eat half of it the only saving grace on the dessert wa the ice cream but you can t exactly mess up on scooping ice cream n nmaybe their other dish are more memorable but i don t think we will return to find out i would possibly return for the cocktail if i were in the area the price wa quite steep a well and i don t think the experience warranted it i love spicy food and i wa excited to try this place it wa just ok very plain tiny portion sauce flavor the jerk chicken wa very dry also they were out of pina colada it took the waiter min to actually come and tell me so i chose another drink and wait another min to bring it he actually just kept forgetting about u the drink were amazing sooo i would go back for the rum bar i m kinda surprised i am writing this i know i wrote this review before but it say write a review so i m going on memory the food wa great we sat outside table of it wa a beautiful day i ordered the plantain spring roll and the main dish escape me but it wa fantastic i wa super happy with my food i raved about it to friend which leaf me perplexed why i am sitting here now month later writing this review lol desert is amazing so is the coffee i m not even sure why i have not been back since my last visit i need to get my shit together it would have been a except for the snotty i m too good for the like of you bartender crack a smile once in a while don t act a if you just don t have time for customer gaby the server wa great tho a wa duane the owner who came and chatted i lived in jamaica in the past so wa a nice catch up food wa lovely too jerk scallop prawn johnny cake and lamb were all very tasty very nice setting outside table even got a few drop of rain great ambience and experience overall great location wa able to park there and walk am able bodied to symphony after dinner ambiance is unique and intimate very cozy and welcoming the place is humming with good vibe the food wa fantastic a were the signature rum cocktail highly recommend a great dinner out i m pescatarian and this wa not a problem at this local i wish i could come here for the cocktail weekly they have a mixed punch that change daily the bartender are dressed old school in a black vest with a white shirt the bar ha fresh herb and homemade tincture for their drink my boyfriend and i went here and had two drink each the bartender wa very helpful in helping u decide which one to try however i heard their drink menu ha changed recently if i am in the art district again then i will def go to this place the only downfall is that everything is so yummy that your bill add up before you know it x o lent no i don t mean the cognac first off food wa great i don t know what real jamaican food taste like or look like but i gather it s similar to what i ate or hope it is this is a small place so if you want to try it out go during the weekday like i did it s a byob restaurant so like your best friend nfl gathering bring what you want to drink though unlike your friend gathering they ll charge you for what you bring but the price is not bad really our server tonight wa on top of it i give this place thumb up this place is an absolute gem in downtown phoenix it s slightly hidden off st but well worth a visit n nthe selection of rum is fantastic definitely try some of the flight you will not be disappointed the food is delicious and the atmosphere is good that said the portion are ridiculously small and overpriced the wait time for seating drink food etc is also longer than most restaurant recently went back word repeated brown stew chicken n nwe also had the seared scallop with blackened vegetable they were also amazing i live super close to this place always have but i certainly don t come here enough my fiancee and i came here on first friday a few week back so thing were a little crazy luckily we had brought our own beer so we were able to crack one open while sitting in the grass waiting for a table eventually we were seated out front so we had an excellent spot for people watching n nwe started out with the plantain avocado spring roll they were golden crispy and delicious the chutney really made them without they would have been pretty bland n nfor dinner i got the curried tofu and my gentleman friend ordered the brown chicken stew this wa not his first choice but they were out of the other two entree he had in mind we also went through a confusing few round of we re out of this nope we have it no actually with our server on my tofu luckily everything that came out of the kitchen wa fabulous the tofu had a great consistency nice and chewy and the coconut rice and bean were rich and filling the brown chicken stew wa also good say my man n noverall great atmosphere great food a little hit or miss with menu option it wa a busy night i ll definitely be back wow i really hated this place n nour server wa also the bartender i ate there last night she wa either terribly slow or terribly overworked either way not my problem she came to the table and gave u a canned speech about what she really like on the menu of course wow everything she liked numbered amongst most expensive on the menu big surprise n n if you read other review on yelp you can read about the pushy service just awful n nshe talked at u and not to u when we were done ordering she in constant sale mode pushed the rice pea which is jamaican rice and bean n ni love rice pea so even though i didn t like our pushy server i ordered anyway when the food arrived my companion and i each took a bite of the rice and if i would have had a napkin i would have spit it out n nthe flavor could only be described a odd and it wa served room temperature we both agreed independently of one another that the rice wa inedible n ngosh the way our server upsold u you would think it would be at least edible n ni ordered the soup of the day i wa told it wa red snapper with vegetable it wa a fish broth with vegetable there wa no red snapper so why wa red snapper included in the title of the soup i have no idea n nso they basically boiled some fish head put some veggie in and made profit on a soup i wa pissed n nof course i would have liked to tell our useless server bartender about this but she never stopped by to ask u how our meal wa not once n nwhen the food wa dropped we ordered another round of drink and did not get them until our meal wa almost finished n nthe manager came and cleared our plate so i told him he just smiled and basically told me it wa my fault for not enjoying the overpriced rice and soup n nplaintains were oven roasted and tasty very stingy portion though i would say about half a plaintain per order these people have their food cost in control baby don t serve any food that s the key n nthe only thing that wa good wa my companion s jerk chicken it wa excellent actually a far a drink go the overpriced mojito vanilla wa also good n nso here s the deal if you are a hipster foodie who like the idea of eating overpriced jamaican food even though you and your knit cap ha never even been to jamaica with stingy portion and poor service this is your place n nthey missed on every level horrible stopped by the other day for a quick togo drink i ordered the my favorite carrot juice which had been hyped on my first visit at first the drink wa nice and carro wait a minute did a baby just vomit in my mouth seriously the food i had here wa great and every other drink is good but every sip of the carrot juice felt tasted like my body wa rejecting a stomach transplant n njust don t get the carrot juice i don t know how they can drink that stuff i am basing this review on two visit n n superbowl weekend we went there it wa a hour wait for an indoor table we agreed to just sit outside and lo and behold we ended up with a little table indoors no wait the service wa absolutely fantastic my partner is a serious water drinker and his glass wa always full the food came out promptly the server were kind but not pushy or rushed the food wa outstanding the drink were amazing it is by far the best place i have eaten at in phoenix especially for the price n n second time wa a quiet weekday i sent two friend to the bar since i would arrive later the two really enjoyed their drink then we had dinner the food once again wa outstanding the service this time wa not so great when i arrived she never came over to offer me a drink i had to finally go get her then we had to hunt her down again to get menu she then left u for minute before being flagged again to take our order later brought our food but didn t provide silverware she wa completely inattentive she never offered additional beverage and then we had to ask twice for the bill and again for her to run our card the bar only ha seat how could she stand there the entire night and be so unobservant of customer need n ni still give it star overall the food and drink are amazing when they are busy the table staff are excellent just watch out for the one lousy bartender the breadfruit is such a cute little restaurant in a very nice neighborhood in downtown it s small but very well put together our waitress wa absolutely incredible she knew how to sell so kudos to her i m a server anyways she wa very knowledgeable and wa able to answer all our question the food wa amazing and so were the drink it wa a little pricey so it ll probably be a once in a while thing for me when i m actually in the area or want to bring friend visiting too great experience overall they have a cute little rum bar too well after a year and a few month of living a stone throw from breadfruit i finally made it in there to be honest with you i wa not very impressed and left with a bad taste in my mouth i love supporting the local restaurant in my downtown but i don t think i will be returning n nthe girlfriend and i decided to come for dinner and we were both really excited to try the food we were seated promptly and greeted by our server craig i think he wa great with describing the food and how spicy and offered his recommendation we had the pumpkin soup to start with some of the festival bread the soup wa tasty but wa luke warm we both expected hot maybe even a gazpacho like soup but luke warm it had a nice kick that snuck up on you but the temperature really changed it the bread wa really tasty though and we moved on to the entree she had the chicken and dumpling dish the sauce had a curry taste to it and wa very good the dumpling while thick and hearty were good a well i opted for the jerk prawn now when i see prawn on the menu i am expecting maybe very large shrimp especially for when i got my plate i wa underwhelmed to say the least i saw medium shrimp on a skewer i will say they did taste good but for the price i felt a little bent over the dish wa accompanied by a cabbage slaw and a slice of grilled pineapple overall tasty but over priced n nwhat really got me wa the bill granted we each had a drink and i knew how much mine wa it wa before gratuity looking at the receipt i saw the festival bread which sounded like it came with the soup wa two stick of bread needle to say i wa just overcome with a sense of disappointment after hearing such great thing changing from one to three star bcoz of great food and they accommodated u later when we revisited them after an hour but the reservation process is still horrible and they acknowledged it hope they will fix it it s sad that they have great food and drink but the service is not great i soooo wanted to love this place we used to have this great jamaican place around the corner in chicago and were really looking forward to those flavor they were very attentive when we arrived and i thought this will be swell n nthen we met our server this place is not very big and our server who didn t seem to know what he wa talking about how s the fish it s yummy how s the short rib so good not helpful wa loud he seemed really overworked which i cannot understand because there are only like table in the whole place and there were others working n nstarter we had the prawn and roti they were amazingly good one criticism when they say prawn they just mean bigger than average shrimp i understand this is common in certain area of the u and the rest of the world but the starter wa slightly different than we expected nonetheless it tasted amazing n nwe had the rum punch of the day to drink very tasty i would go back just to have the prawn and rum punch n ndinner i ordered the short rib stew their take on a beef stew essentially it wa very tasty really i could ve eaten more no really i wish they had given me more the portion wa smaller than i expected for the price the flavor wa nice and spicy and amazing but i still hadn t tasted anything that reminded me of the jamaican food i had back in chicago i know that doesn t necessarily mean anything but n ntodd had the mussel these should really be on the starter menu i m not sure how someone can make a meal out of mussel there s no side and two small piece of bread again for the price it seemed strange also while the mussel were tasty and wonderful they were larger than normal and neither of u care for the larger mussel n nwe were not thrilled and for a birthday celebration it wa underwhelming but we had a nice time because the company wa good i m just not sure our experience wa worth the money we spent so i ve been back a few time since the first time i went and felt it wa only right to update my review since the last one wasn t terrible but it did outline some issue in service that lowered my rating since then it realllly seems like they ve made large stride in the service area a group of u went on first friday last week with the mardi gras festivity the same night they were slammed and totally able to balance it all dramatic improvement guy it s one of my new favorite spot to check out in downtown i wa a little hesitant to visit this establishment after reading the many review on yelp after deciding to take a chance on the breadfruit i am left pleasantly surprised we had made reservation prior to dining and i would recommend that to everyone it is not that big of a restaurant and fill up quickly we started out with plantain avocado baked spring roll and some jerk prawn both dish were fantastic the jerk seasoning had an appropriate level of spiciness and the baked plantain roll were creamy and sweet with the mango chutney that come with it for dinner we had the pimiento smoked mussel and the jerk chicken both dish were awesome you could taste the smoky flavor in the broth of the mussel and the jerk chicken wa fantatstic n nfor drink we both started out with their dark n stormy rum ginger beer concoction expensive but worth it also had a couple red stripe which at each is a bargain n nthe waiter wa a little pushy with the suggestion and special but he is partly a salesman and wa doing his job n ni will go back to the breadfruit a i am a huge fan of rum and they have a whole other side of the restaurant dedicated to that fine sugar cane juice came to arizona for the super bowl this wknd coming from california breadfruit ha been on my list for sometime must say they fullfilled my expectation ambience is fantastic and the food wa great savannah our server wa awesome a well you can t go wrong with the jerk pork over polenta dish the smoked marlin appetizer wa tasty but portion is laughably small you cannot bring a bottle of wine from home here so expect to pay for some fancy drink they specialize in rum drink the sweet potato desert wa amazing kinda tasted like a cross between banana bread and a macaroon n ni am unaware of any jamaican place in los angeles so this place really stand out a unique loved the jamaican background music when you have great food ambience and service you have found the perfect place star i would tell anyone in arizona to try this place and cheebos for an awesome night out i really expected to like breadfruit having read the other review and being recommended a a veggie resturant really there is one thing on the menu that is veggie i m perplexed and underwhelmed anyway not too impressed with the flavor i thought it would be spicier and it took forever to get a glass of water forever to get our beer opened forever to get our food but i wanted to give star for a locally owned business that take buying local serious but maybe give u some more veggie option went to the rum bar this weekend for the first time and absolutely loved it the bartender take their job seriously after all this is a rum themed bar our bartender explained the different cocktail on the menu which were separated by course with a whole section dedicated to classic like mojitos and daiquiri ni ordered the kingston and the velvet and vinyl the first drink made me feel like i wa on a beach somewhere in the carribean the second drink had many layer to it and i could taste distinct flavor of hibiscus in the thick drink both drink used the finest rum i ve ever tasted i even told my husband man we need to stop buying cheap rum and buy the good stuff that s how much of a difference it made nwe could ve stopped at cocktail but ended up ordering two small plate the scallop and the shrimp both plate tasted absolutely delicious but will say they were definitely on the smaller portion side especially for the price noverall can t wait to come back here for another date night with so many good restaurant in phoenix it s not easy to find a bad one lucky for my wife and i breadfruit wa up to the challenge n nsave your time and money there is no jamaican here and no breadfruit beef patty ackee and salt fish brown stew chicken d and g soda or any other staple of the island n nthe price point is completely off the wall and service is pretentious at best and the vibe is hypster with a bob marley soundtrack thrown in for good measure after visiting a couple more time i have seen inconsistency in how they make their dish the few selection of dish is a hindrance if you want to visit the restaurant more than time i am dropping my rating to star due to mixed review every time i go however their oxtail special is a must the host the night we went wa extremely rude basically said he couldn t accommodate our party when there were plenty of table available therefore we left never to return i tasted breadfruit s sweet potato bread pudding for the first time at this year west of western and then a second third and fourth time until they asked me to stop eating all of their sample so when contemplating restaurant for my birthday dinner breadfruit wa at the top of a very short list n nsince i work in wine i think breadfruit s byob policy is fantastic ignore anyone on here who complains about the corkage fee because the markup most restaurant put on a bottle of wine is well over five buck usually it s time what they paid plus byob allows you to bring exactly what you want to complement your meal i would suggest a dry riesling gewurztraminer or an un oaked chardonnay n nthe menu is small but there were plenty of option even for vegetarian i would have happily eaten everything from the appetizer section but my dining pal and i set our sight on the plaintain avocado spring roll that is baked not fried i thought it wa a creamy slice of deliciousness and the accompanying chutney did not disappoint my main dish wa the bok choy and mashed sweet potato alright i ve spent about minute sitting here staring at the screen because i don t know how to describe how great my meal wa here s an idea yum oh my gosh it wa delicious each ingredient and seasoning wa a perfect and direct complement to all the rest it wa filling too i mean bok choy and mashed potato that sound like two side dish to a real meal but this meal is the real deal finally i went ahead and ordered the bread pudding again for dessert it s just dense and lightly sweet and so satisfying mmmm n nbreadfruit s staff were very friendly and attentive and daryl even came over to check on u at the end of the meal the dining room wasn t crowded but we were being very loud per usual and no one seemed to mind in the least what a great experience and delightful setting for a group of friend to celebrate the year s most important date my birthday i went here twice the first time for dinner and the second time for lunch had i only went there for dinner my review might not be so good both time i went there with vegan friend eager to try a new place in the valley n nwe had dinner on a thursday they only have street parking we got there around or and the waitress said we were the first people there all day one other group of people eventually showed up for dinner we had the plantain avocado spring roll with seasonal chutney no complaint here a good appetizer and the chutney wa delicious i then had the coco bread pattie sandwich okay this wa weird the pattie look like a combination of an empanada and a hot pocket which they put between two slice of delicious coco bread so i only ate the bread we shared the sweet potato pudding for dessert pretty good no complaint when we were done we waited for min or so for our check i think she forgot about u but she wa really nice so we didn t care n nfor lunch we first shared festival a an appetizer from the review i d previously read here i expected them to be so delicious that my tastebud would jump out of my mouth but that s what you get for having expectation that are too high they were two miniature breadstick yes their bread is great and only so why not also they were very soft warm i then had the curried chicken and dumpling and my friend had curried tofu my only complaint is that some of the food is too dry like the green banana and the dumpling the dumpling wa this dry solid mass of wheat that i used a a pincushion for my fork or a forkcushion the plantain were delicious a were the chicken and veggie the chicken wa not dry despite some review i ve read to the contrary n nmy friend finished his plate in a few minute and told the waitress that it wa one of the best meal he s ever had however he wa initially concerned with the tofu it tasted so much like meat that he figured it wasn t tofu but wa assured it wasn t meat the waitress told u that the guy cooking behind the counter is also the owner and got all of the recipe from his grandmother in jamaica n nwe ended lunch with the grapenut ice cream and jello by the time you re almost done it morphs into strawberry ice cream very good everything wa fresh i ll go back if i m in the area a friend of ours wa looking online for good authentic jamaican restaurant in az and wa referred to the breadfruit grill he took u there for a friend s birthday hoping to try something good and new i don t know if we were expecting a lot out of it due to good review what do these people eat but it wa no where near my good expectation n nfirst of all we had a reservation and yet they made u wait for about an hour outside in the az summer heat with no water n nsecondly it s byob so we did just that but when we got there they refused to keep our beer and white wine cool while we were waiting it wa only when we were finally seated they cooled our wine go figure on top of that they charged u for cooling and corking them n nwe were also told over the phone that we could bring our ice cream cake but since we were waiting for about an hour outside our ice cream cake had already melted almost all the way there wa no consideration for putting it in a tray of ice when we got there and asked they finally did when we started eating our entree when we ate the cake they charged u for plate doe this place not get enough customer that they have to charge u for everything n nthe food eh food wa nothing to rave about we all got the jerk chicken and about half way eating it we were all dying from it being overwhelmingly spicy mind you of people in our party absolutely love spicy food and have tried authentic jamaican food we even had a few in our party who have even been to jamaica and have tried the food from all sort of spot even aside from the resort they weren t even prompt with our drink to help u to subdue the intense spice of the chicken so when i said we were dying our tongue were literally dying i know some of u didn t even want to finish our meal not only did it kill our taste bud right off our tongue it also made u feel like we had dry mouth the chicken wa extremely dry and overcooked we all agreed we could make better chicken why bother going to this place if you can cook better chicken at home right n nthe only good thing going for this place wa the bread stick that came with the meal and maybe the somewhat quaint atmosphere n nyou know you would also think that with such a big party you d be treated with respect since we brought them a lot of revenue sadly that wa not the case it seems like big party are such a nuisance to them plan on having just a party of people if you plan on dining here with good service but that s even a stretch a i have read on some review good luck to you n ni really wanted to give this place a chance because i always love to try new place especially when it is local but that s an enormous but my first time here wa just utterly offensive obnoxious disgusting and disappointing it s a shame when a big party all agrees to never step foot in this place ever again n nthanks to this place i have made it a point to look at the low rating review and see if they correlate i can t trust the good review on anything anymore take review with a grain of salt i will let you be the judge of this place and i hope you don t experience our nightmare with this place but this is my take on it n nmy first experience here is definitely the last experience here four thumb down let me start by saying this used to be an amazing place i have eaten here many many time but stopped going due to having le business downtown n ni went here this weekend and wa horrified they changed the menu and the same meal i had a year ago that wa star wa now below average it seems a if they lost the cook that made this place so good the food i had tasted like liquid smoke and having been a bbq judge for many year i can tell you that s exactly what it wa n ni wa very disappointed a i looked so forward to revisiting one of my favorite place in town it is such a shame of what happened this place is full of elitist jerk who think they re better than customer what a shocker tried to walk in with some friend for my wife s birthday would have easily dropped dollar and they didn t seat u because we had too many people at the time there wa only customer in the entire place literally two ok guy great service we took our money elsewhere literally never coming back and i suggest you don t either unless you re a masochist who get off on being treated like shit without question the best drink in town i never had an affinity for rum until i started visiting this place regularly every drink ha so much thought and artistry behind it n nalso their coconut curry tofu is to die for i ve been here more than time and i ve never had a bad experience i ll be in again soon for the fall menu the place ha great ambience massive selection of rim and housemate bitter our server wa real knowledgeable and fun awesome night my favorite place downtown to relax and grab a drink at the bar lounge or enjoy a cigar on the patio i recommend trying a few of their variety of rum or a cocktail such a the mojito jamaica or jamaican mule the drink can be pricey however at this place you finally get what you pay for n ntry the for de cana yr for a rum with the finish and nose you d expect from a cognac i m glad i got to try jamaican food but i won t go back n ni am impressed that the restaurant us almost all organic stuff and buy a much locally a possible they are located just a block from phx public market after all n ni ordered the carrot juice drink that came highly recommended by the waitress it wa just okay i really love trader joes carrot juice and would choose that over this restaurant and it is much cheaper na an appetizer my friend and i shared the plantain avocado eggrolls i couldn t wait to try them i love avocado and they sounded amazing for the price i think you only get two eggrolls cut in half i thought that wa a bit pricey they were a huge disappointment plantain are a bit mushy and bland a a rule and so are avocado so together you got a bland mushy eggroll wrapped in a flavorless wonton wrapping it came with a mango puress dipping sauce which wa sweet but not very flavorful and mushy lol n nfor dinner i had the coconut curry tofu the tofu had a texture i have never experienced before and at first i didn t like it but it really grew on me the rice wa blah the coconut steamed vegetable wa boring from how they sound and the fried plantain wa good n nthe restaurant is cute though and the service really good awesome awesome awesome danielle is the all knowing rum goddess best selection of premium rum west of the mississippi had mixed mixed rum drink with only fresh ingredient made right in front of you atmosphere is laid back and casual did not try the food but came highly recommended by local can t wait to go back curried tofu get better every time i go i respect ppl that genuinely care about the food that they put out not very many place in this town live up to that expectation but the breadfruit go above and beyond the breadfruit focus on bringing caribbean flavor to phoenix while using locally grown fresh organic produce small kitchen small restaurant one chef it s almost a though they ve invited you into their house for a meal everything is cooked to order which make all of the difference hence why they don t do takeout staff is always friendly but they are not there to kiss your as if that s what you want go to a larger corporate restaurant where one small complaint will get your entire meal comp ed and you ll have a manager there with his nose up your arse for the rest of the evening the breadfruit is there to share their food with you and a great experience n curried tofu n scallop n patty talapia n brown stew chicken n have to try my favorite carrot juice it s addicting n oh and of course it s byob well hello yelp long time no see i m back now but in a different city and i ll try to get back in the swing of thing so here go first review in phoenix the breadfruit n n n nthe owner of the breadfruit can tell you where the strawberry they use in their fresh made strawberry lemonade come from and the answer isn t costco n ni went in at kind of an odd time on a saturday after a day of apartment hunting downtown there wa a duo and another solo diner both sitting inside the server wa friendly and offered great suggestion the weather wa perfect so i sat outside at one of the handful of table on the sidewalk the curried chicken and dumpling were fantastic served with grilled plantain that taste more like a potato than fruit and fresh bell pepper the dumpling wa dense and went great with the curry sauce although the rice and pea that the server suggested were delicious i think the entrée could have stood on it own n nthe server picked up on the fact that i wa in no rush and she wa friendly and attentive while not rushing me a while later a guy who worked there came outside to eat his meal before the dinner crowd arrived we started talking about the book i wa reading food inc and he told me about the restaurant s goal to provide thoughtful local food turn out i wa talking to duane the owner and i wa pleasantly surprised to hear him tell me the strawberry in my strawberry lemonade come from the farmer s market around the corner and were grown in yuma there aren t nearly enough business owner who care enough to invest the time and energy into such pursuit we talked a little more about our common love for conscious eating and how meal should be experience not quick fix to fill you up he explained that this is why his restaurant doe not package anything to go i can respect that if you want their food you re going to eat it fresh and you re sure a hell not taking it home to microwave leftover n na chef businessman with value who eats his own meal talk passionately about being involved in the growth of downtown and can tell you where his food come from i m a fan n ndid i mention the sweet potato pudd n and vanilla ice cream uh maze ing what am i missing here nthis place ha been on my bookmark for a long time and i finally got a chance to go last night and i left feeling nothing no real wow at the experience n nservice wa excellent our gal wa great no complaint there n nbetween my husband and my dish and the two appetizer and dessert nothing really wa ahmazing i also didn t hear any comment of wow from our friend from their dish n nappetizer sea scallop and the ceviche for a party of you should definitely increase the portion this wa equivalent to bite per person of the ceviche and the scallop were for people come one snobbery scallop were flavorful but ceviche wa ok disappointing n nentrees salmon dish and pork polenta dish my salmon wa tasty but not memorable my husband had the same comment about his pork polenta dish nothing to talk about n ncocktails gin co bootleg smitty my husband did not like his gin co drink i tried it myself and it wa not tasty my friend s bootleg smitty wa delicious though i think really the only thing that stood out the entire night one great cocktail n ndessert they only offer two really neither sounded appealing to me but i wanted some kind of uplifting meal to end the disappointing apps and dinner carrot cake ugh no the only thing i enjoyed on there were the fried carrot everything else wa a blur the sweet pot pie no way i didn t find any flavor or anything about it that said dessert i ve never ordered dessert anywhere and not taken several bite it s dessert how do you go wrong n nwriting all this i feel like i literally flushed way too much money down the drain i know downtown dining is more expensive and i m ok with that but to not be wowed or even impressed with your meal is borderline insulting like they re telling you you re paying for the privilege to eat here no thanks came back last week their sauce are more flavorful than i remember them being but they still have a problem with overcooking their chicken and fish i got the impression that the jerk chicken wa made a tad spicier than it should have been to mask a lack of flavor though can t confirm this but i have a hunch n nthey seem to have gotten their stuff more together but the food still came across a bland but fresh which is sad fresh food should be tastier n ni d go back again if a friend wa paying but otherwise i d pas the carrot juice alone is worth it i crave it n nthis place is so adorable and friendly and the food is tasty i recommend the curried chicken and dumpling in particular and the plantain avocado spring roll the corn is so perfect too n ni want them to serve dark meat but they are going for healthy so they are sticking with the white meat i guess that make sense but i know the jerk would be so yummy on a wing n ni will be back i want more already interesting spot to hide from the busier bar of downtown and grab an intimate late night drink i ve known about this rum bar for year but because so many place i care about keep closing down i decided a couple of week ago that i d stop taking it for granted and dive in n nif you come here at night expect the most clandestine vibe when you take your seat at the bar it will feel a though you should whisper your order you can start with something bright like a rum punch that change daily you might not know what s in it but you know it will be palatable i needed something stiff i went with the garrison with a nice heavy burnt stick of cinnamon a well a a tobacco tincture it wa tough it took a while to finish it put hair on my chest but i can dig it n non your way out you can purchase a cigar to chase your spirit after a long night i quit smoking but i like the idea feel a little noir come to think of it i don t see myself a a regular here but i like it a a cozy little corner for when i want something different no longer byo which is a huge bummer we were very happy taking in our bottle of wine and making a good night of it often with large group of friend but that is no more the bill of course is now much higher and the wine selection wa a bit weak i went here a short time ago with a social networking group i m now a firm believer that downtown phoenix is on the comeback trail i d tried a couple of other joint in the neighborhood including matt s big breakfast and fate so this seemed like the next logical spot it kind of hidden behind condo just one block south of matt s but boy what a find n nwhen you walk in you get that trendy modern industrial feel of a loft you might see in the downtown neighborhood the ambience and music are pretty cool all in all our waitress wa extremely friendly and flexible a we tried to split tab multiple way she earned a nice tip from u for her effort i d never had jamaician or what they call east indie food before so i had no preconceived notion about what i wa going to eat i had their signature dish the jerk chicken with coleslaw corn and coco bread talk about spicy chicken my mouth wa on fire but full of flavor too the side dish were good but nothing special i had a delicious pineapple soda to wash it down so that helped my burning palate for dessert i had the grapenut icecream topped with cherry jello an unusual dish to be sure but it wa definitely tasty n nperhaps what make this place most popular is the fact that this restaurant is very vegetarian friendly along with a fruit salad medley they have a curried tofu dish and a vegan italian soup about half of the folk i wa with had the vegetarian friendly dish and raved about them i wa the only one brave enough to try the ice cream but i promise it nothing scary n nnow this place isn t perfect and here s a couple of reason why in my opinion no reservation and the place is small so probably want to get there right when they open for lunch or dinner a mentioned above the side dish were okay but nothing out of this world if you really pressure them they might be able to break out separate check but a a general rule they typically don t split tab n nall in all it wa a good meal for a reasonable price it great to see establishment like this pop up downtown and hopefully local patron will continue to keep business like this one going we need some ethnic spot like this around town and this one is definitely worth a try and again don t be afraid to try the ice cream james beard would have cut the corn n n okay so i know you must be wondering exactly what that mean we went to the restaurant on a wed night picked up a great rose from az stronghold at public market to avoid the corkage fee and wa looking forward to a new dining experience n nthings started out fabously the wait person wa well informed and helpful with the menu we decided to split three dish n nwe ordered the scallop appetizer they were perfect done to perfection which is not easily done with scallop we split them put one on each plate n nnext came the jerk chicken salad again a wonderful complement of spicy chicken and mango the perfect marriage of spice and sweet n nwe commented we had made the perfect choice of the rose from az stronghold and looking forward to the next course n nand so it came jerk prawn grilled pineapple on slaw with a half an ear of corn ahhhhhh there s the rub the plate would looked lovely but because we were sharing i asked the wait person if the corn could be cut in half don t get me wrong i really liked my dining companion but could not just bring myself to nibble on the same ear of corn the wait person took the plate back to the kitchen we were salivating because the prawn smelled really wonderful n nthen the plate came back and the ear of corn wa still in tack nduring the course of rest of the evening we were given several reason why this simple request could not be accomodated n nahh the chef is an artist and cutting the corn would have upset the balance of the design of the plate we could not cut the ear ourselves because there were no sharp knife there are only two chef and there isn t time to accomodate special request n nok this is a restaurant with maybe table by the time we left there were only people left in the restaurant so special request can t be accomodated also we would have eaten the corn but instead it wa wasted n ni am self employed and my customer are everything to my livlihood if i can accomodate i will even though it might not be exactly what i want to do because the more important thing is i want to establish long term relationship with them and have them come back again and again and again n nunfortunately i will not be going back to breadfruit the food wa generally good but i would rather spend my dining dollar in someplace the recognizes that it is so easy to accomodate simple request and the benefit to do that is repeat customer it would have been so easy to have satisfied customer by simply cutting the ear of corn if like me independently owned ethnic reasonably priced and veg friendly is your steeze this is the kind of place you love to love if also like me you prefer to have a few option for inexpensive beer and wine to accompany your worldly cuisine you knock off one star n nwe split the avocado spring roll to start basically a wrapped up slice of avocado and mango served with a sweet chutney i enjoyed them but i am starting to admit that despite being raised in california and adoring mexican food i will never really like avocado but if you love them like everybody in the world except me you will like this app n nwe then shared the tofu curry and the bok choy stir fry these were both delish and a good value at each n ni wa happy enough with my red stripe for but disappointed by the selection of only wine two of which i think cost glass n nall in all very cute place good food and a place you feel happy to support i have been here twice with my girlfriend for various celebration the first time isaac took care of u he did it so well that on our next visit we had to request him and that is where he really wowed u his extensive knowledge on the food and drink were amazing he wa able to give u extremely detailed description of the flavor of a few dish and drink we were torn between in order to help u make a decision from that whole dinner the true standout wa a pan seared steelhead salmon with a tamarind reduction the salmon wa very juicy and moist but perfectly crispy around the edge i wa curious a to how the typically potent tamarind flavor would fit with the salmon i don t know how they did it but the dish wa out freaking standing we were also curious to learn more about the whole restaurant concept and isaac wa able to tell u a lot about the history of the place and the ethical sustainable sourcing of their ingredient on the second time we were there he wa with a trainee who wa almost a friendly and knowledgeable while isaac is officially our favorite i have no doubt this place hire only the best of the best in order to provide quality sustainable delicious food with top notch friendliness and service the food wa good just too salty i had the jerk pork and polenta too salty i drank cup of water the environment wa nice just the service wa too slow my girlfriend and i went last night and had a very good time we started with the plantain avocado spring roll which we both enjoyed n nshe had the curried chicken and dumpling and thought it wa good but not great the dumpling wa very dense a point that seemed a little odd but the flavor wa very good n ni had the jerk chicken off the grill and thought it wa fantastic the spice wa considerable but delicious the other item on the plate complimented the chicken well n nwe thought the portion were just right and i feel the price of the jerk chicken off the grill dish to be very reasonable considering the quality n nfor drink she had the rum cider another item she thought wa good but not great i had the good jake which i thought wa very good and packed a serious punch of ginger i also had a dark and stormy an enjoyable staple drink n nthe dessert menu underwhelmed u mostly because i wasn t in the mood for ice cream so we skipped that course n nthere wa one very slight issue with a lack of attention when we sat down after thoroughly examining the menu and choosing our drink our appetizer and our entree we had still not even seen a waiter or even received glass of water i m not an impatient person so i think i wa justified in feeling we had been overlooked the first person i did see must ve been the owner i kind of assumed he wa not our waiter but i asked him if he wa anyway he apologized for our wait took our drink and appetizer order just a our waiter showed up a he relayed the order to the waiter he stated that the first round of drink wa on the house i thought that wa a very nice gesture that made up for any mistake on their part based on what i saw of the service at other table i think this wa simply a one off mistake by our waiter and don t expect it would happen on a second visit n nother than that the service wa very pleasant and attentive the owner delivered our food and gave u some tip on how to best enjoy the dish we had ordered water wa refilled often i wa offered another drink a soon a my current drink wa empty all very good service point n nif i could give this place a i would the only mild detraction due to my girlfriend only considering her entree and drink to be good rather than great and the minor attentiveness issue when we were first seated n nwe will definitely be back to the breadfruit nice atmosphere and a cozy little dining room the food wa exactly what we were looking for to satisfy our craving for caribbean i thought it wa a little on the pricey side but overall it wa a great experience amazing had small plate very deceiving taste of the island on steroid rum drink interesting and creative will be back i worked at the breadfruit a few year back so i have the insider s scoop after working in many restaurant i can honestly say theirs is the cleanest kitchen i ve seen dwayne and danielle are good people that actually care about the product they serve they buy veggie from the farmer market we once had a field trip to visit and volunteer on a local farm that they buy their chicken and egg from the food may not be for everyone although i loved it but you should at least stop in for a drink dwayne is a true mixologist his drink are amazing he s from jamaica and us a lot of unique ingredient in the cocktail my favorite wa their pina colada with fresh pineapple and coconut milk the atmosphere is relaxing with reggae music playing check it out despite the food being pretty good our experience there wa terrible we will never be back n ndespite having reservation we waited for more than ten minute with at least empty table before being seated fine n nafter finally sitting down my wife asked for her drink on the rock can t do that said the waiter but he offered to bring a glass of ice cube with it fine n ni asked for a gin based drink sorry he said although we have a full liquor license all we stock is rum fine n nmy wife ordered the red snapper but since she doesn t like to have her food looking back at her she asked that the head get removed n n it s cooked with the head on said the waiter n nmy wife explained that she knew that but just wanted it removed before it got to the table n n can t do that said the waiter n n why n n the chef considers it insulting n nseriously yup n ni can t make this stuff up you will take it with head attached or don t order it n nchef make the rule n nand apparently what chef want come before what the customer want at breadfruit before coming here i d never really had jamaican food the breadfruit wa a really good intro to carribean cuisine and it definitely make you crave for more i ve tried most of the dish here and i must say that this place boast a pretty solid selection of dish and taste it s a great place to bring friend to eat and the atmosphere make for a relaxing environment a jimmy cliff steel pulse or the wailer sound from the kitchen be sure to try out the curry tofu sorrell and carrot juice after dining here last thursday i would classify this a a special occasion place due to the price and ambiance this wa a surprise since i did not get that impression when reading the review or maybe it wa because the couple of other jamaican place i have been to have been dive i loved the classy intimacy of this restaurant it gave me the feeling that i wa having dinner at someone s house who wa both a great cook and also had great taste in decor n nthe impression i have of jamaican food is that it ha really strong flavor but i found the food here to be a little bland i got the jerk shrimp which didn t look very blackened or like it even had a rub on it however when i tasted it i wa surprised and pleased that there wa actually a good spicy kick to it this wa by far the best part of my meal the side it came with tasted good but were nothing special i did really love their cocktail but i wrote another review of the bar since that is a separate business listing i like the fact that there wa so much seafood on the menu try the mussel they are yummy but i think someone who is more of a meat eater might be disappointed i wa also surprised there wa no goat on the menu don t jamaican place usually have goat n noverall i think this is a great place for a date night or a quiet dinner with old friend the food just wasn t special enough for me to want to drive into downtown but if i knew someone who wanted to go here i wouldn t say no what a perfect evening delicious thoughtfully sourced and prepared food along with fresh creative and very reasonably priced cocktail wonderful ambiance chef danielle is a local treasure unique menu definitely not what i expected everything had great flavor but be prepared for the spicy food i am not normally into spicy food but i enjoyed it here i had the rum punch and it wa a delicious i came here for my birthday and couldn t be more pleased with my choice our group of four made a reservation through open table and were seated right on time our service wa amazing our server wa super knowledgeable about the drink and the menu in general he also took a drink off the bill that one of our party didn t finish nthe timing and pace of the meal wa leisurely which wa perfect for a special occasion meal don t rush your time here nwe had the clam and the plantain a appetizer if you re looking for crispy textured fried plantain you ll be disappointed but the flavor were rich the clam were excellent probably my favorite food item nfor the main course i had the swordfish steak it wa perfectly cooked but not spicy like the dish the other three in my group ordered i almost wish it wa a little spicy but the carrot purée and the peanut sauce were a delicious combination nthe highlight of the meal were the drink choice you can t go wrong here nbecause it wa my birthday i received a free rum pour of what wa probably the best rum i ve ever had i ll definitely be back before next year nsweetly at the end of the meal we received postcard to write that they mail for you i thought it wa a lovely touch for a special occasion overall the food wa good but the experience a a whole wa above and beyond i have been to breadfruit several time and the food is always a quality i wa a very disappointed in the restaurant push back when asked to accommodate my friend who is gluten free she made it clear that having bread on her plate would contaminate the entire meal and may make her ill but the server kept resisting stating they cannot take anything off the plate because it ruin presentation i understand that the restaurant doe not want allow substitution but in reality she wa asking for an omission when it come to a food allergy i really would have thought the nrestaurant would be must more accommodating n n nupdate the restaurant owner sent me a message and assured me this policy will be addressed if you are debating visiting the restaurant you will not be disappointed stopped by here once after first friday i liked it but didn t think it wa anything to write home about n nthe curry i got and the jerk chicken the bf got were good but the rice wa pretty terrible hard and chewy i don t know if jamaican people have their rice differently but i like mine soft and fluffy that s the one thing that stick out in my mind n nit wa a cute date place and i love that they had neat artwork for sale from local artist on the wall reasonably priced too n ndon t go out of your way to check this out but if you re right there and craving some jamaican why not service wa not up to par my par is like a bogey lot of rum selection and decent ambiance i wa really disappointed in the smoked trout appetizer with all due respect that seemed store bought like the stuff you can get in the whole food smoked fish section i am not being cute either i have had trout all over the world and almost asked for the chef and his recipe to find out what their prep wa anyways i wa obviously not happy with the dish and the server seemed to careless about my displeasure menu wasn t deep so couldn t pivot elsewhere n nalso i swear the floor were a little dirty it wa dark but i could still tell n ni m not the biggest rum fan although the proximity of this place to where i live could have made it a prime candidate for a restaurant i frequent n nit s whatever a slice of caribbean in arizona i wa referred to breadfruit rum bar a i wa on lookout for caribbean style food the ambiance and the staff is outstanding let me say i have been twice now and sat at the bar both visit the first evening we heavy relied on the bartender for recommendation and they did an excellent job helping u out the daily secret rum punch is a must make sure to uber lyft take the bus or walk these sneaky drink can hit you fast we ordered roasted plantain with mango dip it wa quite tasty next up wa the jerk chicken it wa good not mind blowing but we finished it and felt very happy nsecond visit we picked up our nyc cousin from the airport it wa late but he needed a snack after that flight we ordered jerk pork with polenta and we clearly liked the roasted plantain enough to order again i will say i did like the jerk pork better than the chicken the chicken wa a little over cooked n nall in all i gave it a because the ambiance sitting at bar is excellent and very educational talking to bartender sometimes it s just about the company and drink and yes good food doesn t have to be mind blowing but good food we will be back and maybe sit at a table maybe n np excellent rum selection absolutely incredible flavor service and environment is wonderful and had no issue whatsoever i am eternally grateful for a restaurant like this there is not nearly enough island flavor in the city and i feel the breadfruit certainly represents it thank you i m going to keep this short and sweet the breadfruit is absolutely delicious one of the best meal i ve ever had anywhere in az hand down we had the appleton rum sea scallop a our appetizer which were the best scallop i ve ever tasted very spicy and very flavorful i had the jerked chicken a my entree and my boyfriend had the jerked pork both were excellent n nloved the space loved the vibe service wa great loved the drink loved the food i can t wait to go back a really cut place with a lot of charm i loved all the different rum drink they had we loved the appetizer and we had the chix and the scallop and the food is always top notch the waiter wa very attentive and helpful in ordering the different drink i will definetly go back there s a lost generation vibe here the light are low lit the crowd is sparse but filled with character and the drink are above top shelf ernest hemingway wrote his novel here n nbefore the sun rise this is the place to visit if you re over the younger scene you ll probably come to some type of epiphany if you go here alone n nthis place specializes in a variety of different rum i never liked rum before this place cause i got the grocery store i m on a budget version i get why captain jack sparrow is asking why it s gone it s just that good n nso hit this place up if you don t have chest hair you will grow some if you don t grow chest hair you will grow something afterwards so go to find out what i went to college in miami and i know and love caribbean food living in phoenix choice for this cuisine are quite limited so i wa really excited to try out this place n npros n love the ambience and that s it s small n the food is delicious n the service is great n the carrot juice is amazing n for the most part it s a healthy take on caribbean food n ncons n the price of the food n nregardless i will definitely return this review is a four for the classic mojitos and a one for the service it is a damn shame because those are the best mojitos i have had in phoenix but the service is so damn shitty don t get me wrong the bartender are nice but damn do they all need to act like a bunch of pothead i first came here for their grand opening and after thing had died down waited at the bar for minute before waving them down for a drink they kept walking past me looking down the whole time and then would crowd around the computer trying to figure out the ticket very unorganized my friend and i ended up leaving because of how long it would take to get a drink with bartender i gave it another chance last night and the service wa the same it had been a good minute before the bartender asked if we wanted another mojito my husband wa pissed because he wanted to order food and they never checked up on that after giving u a menu a we were sitting at the bar a guy walk up and tell the bartender um we need menu for our top over there in the corner he seemed very irritated the girl hand him menu and walk over to the bartender with the blond dread and say something about him forgetting about the table i can t say i wa surprised at all the same male bartender forgot my first drink when i came to the grand opening my husband and i really want to have dinner in the restaurant but are afraid the inattentive service extends to the server the menu look delicious so maybe we ll have to do take out this place is so wonderful for cocktail it s so dangerously good my favorite place to go in phx for tasty beverage but it s expensive so i gotta watchale the owner is lightweight a jerk though i always sit at the bar and drink and never have been inside to eat the drink menu change w solstice and thy are so yummy this time i got the bourbon masquerade so sarsaparillayyy cherrish and i luv it my homegirl had the tongue groove oh my goodness shut it down or turn it up whatever blow ur hair back type of good she did say though she probly wouldn t get another cuz the balsamic sits in ur stomach we also got a yummy app some smoked marlin dish totally not what you imagine but none the le tasty however last time we got the salted mackerel app and that is way better either way hand down número uno spot on my place for beverage i stayed in scottsdale for week ate everywhere drank at many different place n nvisited this place twice i enjoyed a very excellent house punch the first time that had me waiting to return again n nsecond time i came i had a tour of three very different drink there wa actually a fourth but i didn t like it and the bartender graciously disposed of it and took it off my bill she wa genuinely hospitable and gave me no anxiety over it i don t recall her name i just know that she s from nm originally her drink were excellent i really appreciated that she understood my preferred flavor profile and considered that i wanted to enjoy multiple contrasting drink n nthe owner tended the bar a well a nice guy i thought her drink were very well made but i noticed that the owner wa coaching her over for example drink that were a couple ounce short just a note of their attention to detail at this place n ni don t agree with the person who called this place hoity toity he s probably satisfied with phoenix s endless but competent beer and hamburger joint n nsince this is a review for rum bar i think star is definitely appropriate but to comment on the food i had two entree one of jerk chicken another of a sort of fish probably escovitch the rice a bit dry jerk chicken dry not flavorful enough but the service wa excellent and they seated u minute before their closing partner and i came here at on a thursday i had their soup of the day which happened to be a red snapper bisque and confused me greatly by being simply a seafood soup a bisque by definition is creamy nevertheless it came packed with spicy fishy goodness and whole peppercorn i think the chef got lucky that i really enjoy peppercorn and fish broth he came out later in the meal asked if i enjoyed it and said that he worried it would be too fishy nice guy btw n ntheir scallop appetizer wa well cooked nice jerk sear on the outside almost gooey inside but rather pricey the jamaican spinach empanada wa seasoned well and baked rather than fried but wasn t anything to write home about n nthe real highlight of the meal wa the carrot juice and strawberry lemonade my partner and i ordered fresh and mostly local which i appreciate n nif i could i would give this review a star rating it wasn t quite but i ll give it the benefit of the doubt because we need more environmentally aware eatery that give their food a personal touch i love scallop and the scallop at the breadfruit were simply the best on the weekend the breadfruit is open till pm and it rum bar is open till midnight which make this a great late night haunt pick your favorite rum drink and share a scallop appetizer for the perfect lite end to the evening the server were excellent and handled my gluten allergy easily offering suggestion and slight modification to the dish the breadfruit is located at east pierce which is south of roosevelt and just east of first street put this place a a must on your late night hit list my go to place whenever i can spend a little money it is worth every penny i know i can order anything off the menu even if it something i ve never heard of because it is going to be prepared flawlessly nthere is no place that pay closer attention to the detail my first impression of this place did not start off great my husband myself and a friend from out of town came for a lite dinner and wanted to be seated outside we waited about minute to be seated once they finally told u our table wa ready they sat u in the cigar room the cigar room ha wall but no ceiling i guess you can consider that outside i dunno however there are no table in the cigar room how were we supposed to eat we didn t want to wait any longer so we just made due one look at the menu and i wa suddenly full wow is this place expensive for a cocktail i ended up ordering the non alcoholic carrot juice for it wa actually really good we ordered appetizer to share between the of u we thought that would be enough seeing that each appetizer wa about the appetizer ended up being more like sample i wa somewhat embarrassed in front of my our guest we all had to fight over these tiny appetizer the only upside to the night wa the carrot juice and the attentive server who kept refilling our free water n noverall i would recommend this place only if you want to spend some major dough and still be hungry when you leave my wife and i went here last night with our baby girl the restaurant wa mostly empty at about pm on a thursday night it ha a small urban restaurant decor with brightly colored wall and photo of jamaican local and item the window were filled with little glass votives with tea light in them the people in the kitchen and the waiter were friendly and greeted u on the way in and thanked u on the way out n nwe ordered the sorel and some drink made with mango mint and tea for drink the jerk chicken and the escovitch fish and festival for our entree we skipped the appetizer to save room for dessert i like the sorel but my wife thought it wa too spicy for her taste it ha a very strong ginger taste to it we both liked the mango mint tea drink the jerk chicken wa good i didn t think it wa too spicy at all it definitely left a presence on the tongue but nothing that wa unbearable or really unexpected the escovitch fish wa supposed to be spicy a well per the waiter but it wasn t a spicy a he made it out to be my wife really liked the bread stick with the vanilla scent we had the sweet potato bread pudding for dessert and had to order second it ha a nice crunchy coconut top which contrast wonderfully with the soft inner bit n nthe menu overall is limited but i didn t think this wa a problem portion are appropriate and not overwhelming in size so you don t feel like a blimp when you leave dessert wasn t large enough to split that or it wa just really good the restaurant doe have a byob alcohol policy so if you want a beer or some wine it s corkage fee for the wine and per bottle for beer most place i ve seen with a byob policy charge for wine the service wa good only issue is that almost all the parking near by is metered so remember to bring some change for the meter i ve had the luxury and the pleasure to have eaten the best jamaican food prepared so i m a bit biased haling from flatbush ny where everybody and their mama is a chef oh and i ve had the opportunity to eat at an actually jamaican restaurant in jamaica i m more than biased n ni wa hungry my hunny wa hungry we were hot and tired of fast food so we decided to trek via the steel horse to this quaint restaurant ndecorum ndecorum paint job wa nice yellow and green wall picture of jamaican food local art jamaican painting nice candle small table nice environment for couple table outside no one wa outside because it wa hot as degree hell n bob marley is what i sang along to while i waited patiently for my food we held our breathe this is phoenix after all there are no jamaican here so i thought nservice when entering the restaurant everyone behind the counter said hi i felt like i wa at blockbuster they were a happy to see u a i wa hungry to eat my food the lone waiter looked like a hippy not jamaican and i knew he wasn t jamaican because he had a new jersey accent and he wa err um not black nthe food i ordered they brown stew chicken with rice and pea and huge heep of cabbage never had it prepared that way never want to eat a huge slimy hard to cut heap of cabbage again try shredding it please one red and one green pepper slice and to my dismay two puny slice of plantain yes i wa disappointed for that is the best part of a jamaican dish i eyed my date plate for his and he had his arm guarding his plate like a prisoner in jail so no not enough plantain the rice and pea tasted like indian rice it looked like indian rice in fact it wa indian bismati rice the chef told me himself jamaican dont eat bismati rice it too expensive they eat white rice with bean i wa confused but i wa hungry and i did eat it nno ginger beer available but the carrot juice wa not so bad and the three dollar glass of ice tea wa ok because my boyfriend ordered it but then he drank my drink because it wa bleh n nliquor wa available but read below why we didn t indulge n nthe price pretty steep for a jamaican restaurant but i wa hungry and not paying two meal and two drink came to a whooping my boyfriend gave a measly three dollar tip mostly because he wa a decent waiter and time are hard and because there were more staff there than customer and they were watching our every move n n nsynopsis surprisingly i ate everything on my plate my hunny ate everything on his plate and then tried to eat my food because he paid for it wink so it wasn t that bad the chef dropped by to ask me how my dining experience wa i frankly asked about the rice wa it basmati rice he said yes he explained in a nerdy hipster narrative that he knew the butcher who the killed the animal and the farmer who grew the veggie his lifestyle and how he wa injecting ether to the restaurant scene in phoenix that is why i am giving the guy a break so instead of giving him a i will give him a you know what ill change it to because i m pmsing and like i said i am biased support the guy it quaint nicely located in downtown phoenix and he came all the way from to jamaica to hell kitchen to feed you wholesome well prepared jamaican food n n n n n what an awesome and quaint spot if i lived in az this would be my regular place to dine drink and light up a stogie one thing to note they open at pm on the dot we had rsvp for p and i could literally hear them check the time and not let u in until it wa p exactly that wa off putting but understandable off putting because we were the only people there min early and would have loved to sit at the bar for a while but understandable because they wanted to be ready for any crowd at anytime and we knew it opened at but anyway the food wa a excellent a nice modern take on traditional jamaican fare everything needed a dash more salt to bring out the flavor more we ordered the ham hock and butter bean bean a bit more al dente than we like but the hock wa smoked and cooked nicely the escovitch catch of the day wa great requested more escovitch the jerk cornish hen were pretty good too just the right smoke and spice now onto the drink rum punch of the day wa a bit to medicine y for u but can i tell you the rum old fashion the pina colada and the velvet and vinyl are exquisite for dessert we opted for the rum cake which wa rich and dense like a rum pudding nice consistency and flavor but by far the best part of the meal wa the appetizer seared sea scallop we had several order i guess i would be remiss if i didn t mention the atmosphere look upscale but it s a very comfortable space the cigar area wa cozy and the mural on the wa wa fantastic i wish i would have take a picture anyway i hope this wa helpful do it their rum bar ha now been open a while and flight are available i wa never a rum aficionado too many rum n coke when i wa too young to care about such thing and have now discovered a whole new world n nthe food ha become nothing short of spectacular n nthe ambiance from the inside i can pretend i m in the west village circa by greenwich and horatio doesn t get any better than that i have been the the rum bar time before and the service wa fine a wa the food stopped by tonight and wa meeting a friend for drink i arrived early they told me i had to sit in the waiting area until my party arrived there wa no one in the place yet i couldn t sit at a table and be served a drink or be ask to have a seat at the bar no i had to sit right by the door on a bench i went to turf around the corner where they welcomed my drink order while i waited for my friend n nway to pretentious for me i won t be back the best cocktail in phoenix great back patio to sit and sip an amazing drink the ingredient of each drink are very thought out no fake sugary mix are used at time it seems like and uppity crowd but that doesn t matter once you try a cocktail sit back chill and listen to some reggae the tamarind ball and the handcart are my favorite drink the best bread stick i ve ever had so good i ordered an extra to go it s refreshing to be able to get new cuisine and breadfruit fit the bill my other favorite part wa the byob however don t listen to the server that say it s just a couple block away next time i ll be sure to bring my own vino first time visiting this bar on a saturday night and wa not disappointed we arrived at the time of our reservation but our table wasn t ready yet so the hostess led u to their back patio where we could order drink and wait for our table our waiter wa friendly and good natured answering question we had and making recommendation about drink and the food once our table wa ready we were promptly seated our drink came out shortly thereafter and we also ordered some dish to share my first drink wa a hurricane charlie it wa well balanced with the rum and fruit flavor i don t like passion fruit but the flavor wasn t overpowering the drink we also ended up getting a round of pina coladas and they were delicious i didn t try all of the food dish but the jerk shrimp and johnny cake wa delicious this is a hidden treasure an extremely romantic and soothing environment with delicious rum remedy candle really set the scene for an intimate outing it s so warm and welcoming that you would think you were right at home the food is nothing le than amazing it s surprising that they offer this caliber of beautiful and delicious meal for such a great price the waitress we had wa very informative and suggested perfect item to try and ultimately fall in love with i would highly suggest going i had been wanting to try this place for a while and am so glad that i did first off i am no stranger to the caribbean jamaica or rum this is extremely creative food in a very hip funky space the staff ha it going on very organized almost orchestrated to make your dining experience flow a smoothly a the sweet reggae music in the background we had small plate and then split an entree the plantain with a mango dipping sauce were terrific a were the scallop the heat of the scotch bonnet pepper wa evident and went very well with the most excellent cocktail that they serve we had hemingway s daiquiri and the punch bowl special truly magical next came the jerk shrimp small plate and the jerk pork entree amazing shrimp that had a sweet hot fruity sauce around the bowl to go with the johnny cake and a home made tarter sauce for the shrimp very good the jerk pork over polenta wa a very creative dish not a large portion but we found it to be just right decided to have more cocktail before leaving for the symphony asked the waiter to bring me a sipping rum over ice he asked me a few flavor question and a price range the range is from to yes two thousand five hundred dollar per glass the rum collection is vast and come from all over the world the glass of rum arrived with a single large cube of ice and wa the best rum i have ever tasted m had the velvet and vinyl which she loved we decided right then to return after the symphony for desert we did and sitting at the amazing bar she had a desert cocktail a sea salt and caramel rum desert drink that wa wild and rum cake while i sipped another daiquiri i can t recommend this place strongly enough the bartender will educate you about rum and you get to watch them make some great cocktail a well do go here and try it all wow breadfruit rum bar wa an unexpected stop when we were in phoenix we had intended to visit another bar but we somehow got turned around and ended up here a total happy accident n nwe seated ourselves at the busy bar and were warmly greeted by both the bartender and the patron who seemed to be regular there wa light music playing in the background and everything about this place wa totally at our pace n nour favorite drink wa definitely the daily punch it change yep exactly daily on this occasion the punch wa light refreshing and had a great green bell pepper note sound strange but wa absolutely perfect n ni will definitely return when in the area this place wa amazing my friend and i started a dinner club and this wa the pick for our inaugural meeting i will refer to my friend a j and s n nwe sat outside on the patio and i recommend that if you visit when it s not too hot n ni ordered the tofu curry with jasmine rice and plantain it wa amazing i usually don t like coconut curry but this wa very good i will definitely order it again n nj ordered the jerk shrimp with pineapple corn and breadstick we had read that the jerk seasoning is very hot and we were warned inferno is a good way to describe it i love hot food so i didn t mind it at all when i tried it j paired the shrimp with the pineapple and found that it toned down the spicy to a manageable level and wa a delightful combination i tried a bit of the breadstick and it wa a sweet bread which wa great to balance out the spiciness of the jerk shrimp n n ordered the molasses chicken lollipop with red potato when her order arrived we all agreed that lollipop wa an excellent description because the dish looked exactly like we expected i asked s for her opinion and she said the meat wa good and the molasses added a nice sweet flavor that went with the name lollipop but wa borderline overpowering the potato were good a were the vegetable but i could have used more than veggie on the plate n nwe all ordered the rum punch which is different every time this night it wa a raspberry pink blend i enjoyed it so much i had two n nwe were warned that the portion size are smaller than other place the price are higher than other place in the area but i believe that you get what you pay for i think that the quality of the food justified the price n nour waitress margaret hit the sweet spot between being attentive without hovering she wa very knowledgeable about the menu and gave good recommendation i eat out frequently i have dined at hundred of restaurant and bar worldwide the service here wa impeccable the entire staff including our server isaac were attentive friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu the food wa eclectic well flavored and made from local ingredient they also have a great selection of rum i would recommend this restaurant for date night business meeting or a casual get together my first trip to phoenix i wa looking for the best food donwtown phoenix had to offer it is not the breadfruit aside from their nice lounge like interior it wa awful the menu is limited and it my personal pet peeve for someone to call a green plantain a sweet plantain i m a vegan so they have one vegetarian option on the menu which i wasn t interested in so i asked if i could create a plate they said no because theyre flavor were expertly paired and the dish were already made ha i wondered is it a tv dinner because if not you should have no trouble putting rice and pea plantain and green on a plate i asked if a watermelon could be put in my mojito they said no like how hard is that i looked around to see if the business reflected all the no s i wa getting and the place wa empty mind you it wa dinner time and it a dinner restaurant i finally ordered the avocado plantain spring roll the bartender brought me out to menu item that i did not order and tried to convince me that i ordered them the spring roll could have been good if the plantain were actually sweet i paid my bill and went over to the westin restaurant and had a great meal this is an attractive mid priced option for the downtown phoenix asu campus i went with a fellow foodie and a couple of newbie to food re the island n nthe staff wa very friendly and well kept the place wa a well very attractive from the street and the interior is small and simple the food wa good perhaps a little tame for true jamaican but very tasty and healthy n nwe had the spring roll to start i would skip them next time and try one of the pie instead they let me taste the somekinda flower juice which tasted close to hibiscus juice and wa a little strong to drink a whole glass of i settled for an imported ginger beet they also have a carrot juice concoction which involves vanilla and ginger which sounded good n nfor the meal i had the brown stew chicken my friend had the curry chick and jerk chicken i think mine wa the best and def give credit to tiphanie b for the recommendation each plate came with side which made the meal a lot of fun n ngreat location service and ambiance pretty good food not your down and dirty jerk shack but an excellent addition to the downtown scene and one of the only place open for lunch on saturday and sunday this is an amazing little treasure in downtown phoenix being from houston and frequenting nyc regularly breadfruit is the perfect little mix it is situated on a quiet street reminicent of midtown in houston the authentic food is so nyc spicy and savory i had the jerk shrimp and it rocked the spice wa hot enough to satisfy my appetite the sweet potatoe pudding wa a great way to top off the spicy shrimp the staff is super friendly and accomodating i loved the sidewalk bistro set up coffee is served in a french press between the charm and wonderful food i am going to crave this place all the way from houston holy f ing hotness i literally watched my date s eye tear up and stream down his face repeatedly in unison with mine see after we took a trip to jamaica last year we foolishly assumed that no transplant restaurant in the middle of downtown phoenix could compare to the legitimate heat the actual island s dish offered boy have i never been so wrong n nwhile the breadfruit s offering are quite tasty i cannot stress enough that this place is not for the faint of heart after year of living in phoenix i add jalapeno and hot sauce to just about every single dish i eat and the spiciness the breadfruit threw my way totally kicked my as i think we may have gone through pitcher of water over our minute meal at the end of the night my date s head wa so overheated he actually felt his ear popping repeatedly note whether that wa actually happening or my date wa just a pussy we will never know n nanyhow on to the food i ve been hear several time now and am hooked on the jerk chicken plate and the jerk chicken salad i ve also had the scallop entree which while tasty and this pain me to say wa just too freakin hot for me the jerk chicken is spicy a shit a well but the mango infused dressing and pineapple bite do a wonderful job of cooling your mouth i think i only needed pitcher of water my last trip n nthey recently opened up a bar next door called the rumbar this is what really excited me about this place over brand of authentic jamaican rum to choose from with all hand muddled ingredient to throw in their mojito is sugary and delicious n ni ve also been blessed with excellent service each time i went however i do have an issue with a particular duke of the breadfruit who is a freakin server there stop checking in to your work it s cheating n nnext time you need your sinus cleared out look no further than the breadfruit i ll be the chick with empty water pitcher surrounding her plate the service wa very friendly but horrifically slow and disorganized one waitress serving the entire restaurant plus she had to make coffee finish plating detail we asked many question about the menu when she returned to take our order i ordered shrimp and then she informed me that they were not serving any shrimp dish that day she could have told u that when we were seated and shrimp comprises about half of their menu duh n nfood wa good not fantastic but solidly good the festival bread stick were delicious we had an incredibly fresh piece of snapper that wa really well prepared while i did not like the seasoning on the curry chicken the meat itself wa very fresh and juice and did not taste like factory farm chicken but good free range meat it ok but nothing special drink a little on high side with no drink special food is ok something i can cook at home with some rum beef jerky and some bbq sauce and call it jamacian one word rum punch it is a flavor of the day type punch and all are amazing definitely make reservation because the location is tiny and i would recommend for more intimate party the food is so incredible and unique i ve never had something i don t enjoy here did i mention the outside is a cigar patio so fun for the men i have been to the rum bar a few time in the past few week they have some pretty interesting cocktail i have had the watermelon cocktail pina colada rum punch their mixed punch stuff that s on the counter and the strawberry basilica my favorite wa definitely the watermelon soooo good it is sweet yet light and refreshing the pina colada is a little too rich for me a they use coconut milk in it the strawberry is very good sweet but clearly alcoholic the punch that wa on their counter last night wa excellent it tasted like clove and fruit really interesting overall this place is great but here is my gripe last night we wanted to get some food but we were informed that they don t serve anything but apps in the bar area or outside and we couldn t get a table in the restaurant for another hour or so the waitress told u that they have a very small kitchen and that s why they do that we were fine with ordering apps and got the scallop the prawn flatbread and the avocado spring roll the portion size were so small and the price were so high for we got scallop after being told that they were good to share kind of ridiculous the scallop were excellent but i wanted more than one bite for the price the prawn were just alright and were more like a dip with piece of bread than what i would typically think of when hearing flatbread aka pizza the spring roll had a decent flavor but were mushy i will be back for drink but i wouldn t order appetizer again i felt kind of ripped off i also am not sure why they can make these appetizer in their small kitchen and can t make some rice and bean or curry for the small amount of people in the bar oh well aruba jamaica ooh i wanna take ya bermuda bahama n nif you want any type of rum from any of the above cmon on pretty mama you don t have to go to kokomo but if you or you re amx is really pretty there is a year old appleton estate rum for per now if your pocket book isn t feeling oh so hemingway the breadfruit claim to have the most extensive rum menu in all of arizona and after seeing it for myself i happen to believe this claim the drink here are all worthy starting a described by our attentive waiter a fruit forward to more heavy and serious and after dinner a the drink menu follows on the bartender at the breadfruit have a romance with rum which is regarded a the most versatile spirit there is a rum punch of the day the evening we were there it wa a light fruity rum concoction of hibiscus and roasted smoked pineapple the punch carried punch do not come expecting a full wine list here a there are only two from southern arizona this is a rum bar be prepared to take an uber the next drink i had for dinner in lieu of wine wa a velvet and vinyl this drink wa almost too pretty to drink the waiter delivered this deep pink to red libation to my table in a beautiful little glass don t be fooled by it beauty on first sip i decided to do just that sip it the velvet and vinyl is a beauty of appleton estate vx rum hibiscus liquor which is house made ginger pineapple lime bitter and a touch of rose mist if you are the dd on your night here don t worry there are nice libation that carry sans alcohol for you too n nkey largo baby why don t we go to kokomo n nspeaking of kokomo if you have ever been in the florida key and had a corn fritter than you will appreciate some of breadfruit appetizer we noshed on the delicious salt fish fritter it wa a flat fritter of cod fish served with a creme fraiche of dill and coconut there are two served warm on a plate and a good way to offset some of that rum before dinner n nmontego why don t we go jamaica n njamaican jerk the breadfruit and rum bar ha that too for dinner i had the jerk pork and polenta a slowly smoked pork shoulder that had been marinated in rum what else jerk rub and smoked over pimento wood and served over tasty warm polenta and seasonal farm vegetable the pork is more of a pulled type dish over the polenta my date my husband also wanted to relive our vacation to the caribbean with some taste of jerk and rum and opted for the pimento wood jerk chicken which wa a huge serving of game hen smoked over pimento wood rubbed with house jerk rub and served over rice and small pea this dish had some spice to it it come a a hen on a bone and wa amazing the table of u being had various plate that included the blue mountain curried goat over basmati rice and it wa said to be yummy and tender and looked like a generous portion the guava glazed pork belly wa also ordered on our table and there were about slice of the pork belly two being super fatty with not much meat which can happen with pork belly and one reason i personally don t order it our friend ordered a dessert to share and for it wa a super small ramekin of dessert which is a little on the pricey side to me whereas i felt the rest of the menu wa on point for pricing the menu is ever changing and us local farm and source such a maya farm wash ranch pillsbury wine and the meat shop just to name a few n na couple of thing to know the breadfruit and rum bar is small make a reservation if you are having dinner we had a party of for our monthly little dinner club and were asked to secure with a credit card they will confirm on the day of the reservation and i like that there wa a mix up with our reservation when we arrived despite the confirmation via telephone earlier in the day for what wa to be a half and hour later than wa logged into the reservation system when we arrived so i am glad we decided to arrive early for a drink there wa also some confusion over wanting a drink at the bar and the girl wanting to take u out to the cigar area patio out back it all worked out and i didn t care either way because we ended up loving our waiter who carried u through the first drink to the last drink after our dinner wa served parking is somewhat a bear in this area also allow time for that the patio should you want to sit out there for the cigar and rum manifest a separate menu all it own ha patio heater for the winter and is expansive n nour service from order to getting entree wa slow but my husband and i don t mind that after having lived in france and knowing that food is what make social time the best the wait staff made up for the slowness ten fold anyway n n neverybody know a little place like kokomo n well at least if you order that appleton estate vintage you will nye fix price menu wa delightful great flavor combination and rum pairing only question for other folk were you surprised like i wa at gratuity automatically added a a service fee a friend recommended this restaurant through casual conversation almost a year ago so i bookmarked it and i am so mad it took me so long to try it n nmy cousin and wife were in town so per usual i wanted to try something new while they were here and the breadfruit did not disappoint our waitress wa autumn like the season lol and she wa amazing very knowledgeable about the menu with her description and what we should try if we liked certain food everything she recommended wa great n nwe had the pimento wood jerk chicken jerk pork chop and the red striped curried prawn and there wa no food left behind n nfor drink she recommended the rum line and sugar and my cousin loved it i had the rock steady and it wa refreshing ok i wa a bit harsh last time to be fair that salad wa really something awful i have been back once for just appetizer and again last night for a dinner date with the bf both time have been fan tastic last night we started with the scallop and a couple of drink the scallop were amazing spicy and perfectly cooked the portion is a bit small though for the price big scallop for i ordered the pork belly and it wa tender and delicious it came on top of a white bean mash with a sweet and spicy sauce so good the bf got the jerk pork with polenta oh em gee i could eat that everyday but i wouldn t of course look around it wa spicy spicy enough to make my nose run a little it wa flavorful smoky spicy and savory the polenta wa the perfect side to go with the meat too droooool for dessert we had the chocolate and orange souffle the souffle wa very good molten and delicious chocolate with just enough orange flavor but the thing that made it rum whipped cream yes you read it right rum whipped cream it wa perfect with the souffle and just such a good idea overall yes it is expensive but i had a fabulous time there it is cute and intimate and the food is awesome the service is great attentive but not too attentive i will definitely be back n n np be sure to make reservation this place is tiny and get booked up nice little low key place in downtown phx well except for the owner who wa anything but low key in deciding where it wa me and a colleague should be seated once he wa pleased with our table it s going to get busy any minute now he assured u we checked out the menu and it looked good my friend wa really happy with his jerk prawn and rice while i had the brown chicken stew which wa really flavorful the only disappointment wa the dessert their signature sweet potato pudd n wa frozen if it s their signature award winning dessert don t you think they d at least make it fresh despite this i d go back to the breadfruit for a little taste of the carribbean in the heart of the desert a group of u dined at the breadfruit during a conference if there were a plethora of choice downtown we may not have tried it but we are glad we did n nwe had no problem getting a table relatively late on a tuesday night the restaurant is not particularly large for dining indoors and the outdoor space wa closed there is a small and cozy bar area n nthe menu is varied with some traditional jamaican caribbean dish like jerk spiced chicken fish cooked in a banana leaf and curried goat we were pleased to also find two creative vegetarian dish the preparation is upscale this is not your hole in the wall kind of place the cocktail are limited to rum drink including some classic made with rum and a couple of beer n nthe service wa attentive and friendly if i were in the area again on business i d definitely check out breadfruit again a great caribbean jamaican menu and rum bar the restaurant wa recommended by the hotel concierge at wyndham where a friend wa staying while she visiting in phx we decided to try it out and were both very happy we did we shared plantain and avocado spring roll for an appetizer excellent she had the jerk prawn and plantain for her entree and i had the brown stew chicken both excellent choice jerk prawn were very spicy a they should be brown stew chicken wa mildly spicy a i preferred special on rum drink made from scratch wa great deal for a downtown restaurant i had a dark and stormy ginger soda and rum excellent we shared the ice cream parfait with raisin and cherry tart agar agar for desert so worth the extra calorie nour server wa terrific and very helpful good atmosphere cozy with just the right amount of mood music the rum bar connected to the restaurant is a nice alternative if you want to skip dinner and enjoy the tasty mixed rum drink instead a nice cozy restaurant with a very nice staff the food wa just ok it s like jamaican organic fusion it wa a little to trendy and not enough food three year ago i received the worst service of my life i agree with one of the previous reviewer who stated that the waiter were very pushy my waiter acted very pretentious a he recommended every expensive dish on the menu he seemed disappointed when we did not order expensive drink and food i ordered the jerk chicken which wa semi decent but over priced i did not order the chef s special later my waiter brought the special by our table and basically said that we should have ordered the special he proceeded to walk away without making eye contact i felt like i wa being harassed by him my girlfriend ordered the curry tofu plate her vegetable were burnt and her tofu looked like gruel all in all i would recommend that people go anywhere else in phoenix microwave meal in your own home would be a better option i wish i could give this place a negative star rating f for service and a d for food n nyeah just do not ever go here nstay away if this cocktail bar wa in ny i would live inside it what a total gem i came here both night that i wa in phoenix and i wish i wa in town longer just to come to this place a third time all the drink i tried were phenomenal n ni have a tendency to always order drink that sound good but end up being terrible to the point where i always have to drink the other person s drink however everything here wa so good no matter what i ordered it wa delicious i don t think a bad cocktail exists here n ncocktails are priced at and personally i thought that wa extremely cheap because i m used to paying for something of this caliber so naturally i had to order a many different cocktail a i could and i loved every single one of them n nin addition to drink i also had the rum cake and that wa really good the flavor were really pronounced and the tanginess of the orange really permeated through the rum cake i don t like ginger so i had to take off the ginger on top but i can see why it wa there n nparking hard to find free parking on weekend but you can park in the parking lot right behind the restaurant if you don t plan to stay for too long i wa told you re not likely to get towed and luckily i wasn t even though i wa there for several hour a i bar hopped healthy food the way it ought to be i do not think price is high when i can eat something totally healthy for my body and well being waiter are friendly and beverage are fabulous try carrot juice or seasonal fruit quencha entree wa needle to say superb and veggie were grilled perfectly why would i ask a chef to cut a corn on the cob in half to share when it tasted so good unless i wa with a cheap date i can buy it for her for only anyway i am not an expert on restaurant but i can wholeheartedly recommend the breatfruit for anyone who ha exotic taste and his her palate is hot and spicy side one thing if you are used to eating junk food including pita jungle s you need not to visit will go back again and again a holy hidden hideaway we sat at the bar and drank the punch bowl special x which is a sneaky little number because you literally can t taste the bacardi in it ni had to slow my roll and order the sweet potato puddin the restaurant itself i didn t have a chance to venture to but the bar wa scenic and felt like we were far away from home we kinda were but i mean it felt like we were on a caribbean getaway sound corny see for yourself breadfruit is a cool spot the interior of the place is well decorated and they can only seat about people making a nice intimate ambiance i really appreciate that they serve locally grown organic produce and that their chicken is all natural and raised cage free any addition of a jamaican restaurant down town earns at least three star in my book we arrived at pm and were the only people there throughout almost the entire meal n nwe brought our own bottle of wine and there wa only a corking fee not to shabby n nwe started with the plantain and avacado spring roll i really liked that wonton wa baked and not deep fried the presentation wa nice the mango chutney wa fresh but the roll themselves lacked flavor i really wished they would have paired some other fruit or spice to add more contrast to the dish n nfor my main i got the jerk chicken and i wa a little disappointed again they did an excellent job with the presentation but the corn wa mushy and what the jerk rub lacked in flavor they tried to make up for in spice i like spicy and can handle a lot of heat but heat shouldn t overpower flavor n nthe chef owner came out and asked u how we enjoyed our meal and explained his philosophy behind the food the service wa excellent but in comparison to some other jamaican place i ve been it really only warrant star sorry while cuisine is original tasty nicely presented service and policy flunk the test our wait person a well a the maitre d were obsessed with having u wait for our guest before seating this wa at pm and the table were half empty their waiting area is a padded bench with the comfort of a dentist waiting area staff and diner traipsing around nearly stepping on in your foot a you try to scrunch up to avoid them repeatedly we were pestered about when the third person would show finally we asked if we could please sit at the table and were treated to a harangue about how owner dwayne hope you re seeing this doe not like to sit people until all guest arrive fine that s his choice ours is to skip breadfruit amazing food and cocktail the music is to die for if you are a reggae fan like me na perfect meal very cozy and romantic place for dinner or just drink at the bar the bartender is the best very knowledgeable about the liquor and even it history we always sit at the bar because we enjoy talking to the bartender and learning food is amazing and delicious too it s not the best carribbean restaurant i ve been to but i did like that they had some unique item on the menu the rum glazed prawn with roti were good the mussel dish came with ton of mussel and a flavorful broth the dessert wa a disappointment but i would give it another try and try another item if i am in phoenix again hearty simple and to the point n nwhen i think of jamaica i think of a simple way of life that still ha a bite to it the breadfruit is a wonderful reflection of that the dish aren t presented in a flashy manner nor is the ambiance posh however the flavor is the focal point and that point is well taken n nthe jerk chicken is my favorite dish the chicken is so damn moist on the inside while the jerk seasoning on the outside brings tear to your eye wonderful i wasn t that impressed with the drink and i tried the food to be so so nothing that knocked my sock off nservice wa hit or miss i had to keep flagging down our server to get another drink or put in an order of food ni don t think i d ever go back again had a nice family dinner here staurday night it wa delicious nour server wa very helpful nice she suggested several menu item they were spot on nwe started with the plaintain avocado spring roll some patty the spring roll were ok not enough flavor for me we ordered a spinach pattie and a fish pattie the fish pattie wa amazing the fish wa spicy and the pattiy crust flavorful flaky the spinach pattie wa hearty and the flavor wa decent but def not a good a the fish pattie nwe ordered entree jerk shrimp jerk chicken curried lamb nthe jerk shrimp wa spicy perfectly cooked i loved it nthe jerk chicken wa flavorful but the shrimp wa better more heat etc nthe curried lamb wa off the chain i mean soooo good melt in your mouth tender great flavor served with acorn squah stuffed with sauteed green it wa a great mix of flavor and texture nfor dessert we had blue mountain coffee which wa served with coconut cream unsweetened nice touch and the sweet potato ginger pudd n the pudd n had a good flavor full of raisin but wa a little dry the a la mode wa prob the way to go a the extra liquid wouldve help the dessert noverall star very cute inside super small but not overcrowded cant wait to go back can t believe i haven t written a review yet so i live walking distance to rum bar so it s a staple in the neighborhood rum is the name of the game and anejo wil be to blame n nthere will be no rum and coke in this place the owner who will always great you at the door will help you expand your palate with a craft cocktail or flight of rum n nmy favorite drink have been the swizzle and they make a great dark stormy work yourself through the rest of the specialty cocktail you won t be disappointed n nhave only had some apps and desert here the spring roll scallop and the parfait have been excellent n nthe abuelo yr ha been a great sipper and compliment many of the dish rum bar reminds my of nyc and it s a pleasure to sit and soak up some good conversation with friend food wa amazing we ordered the jerk chicken and beef brisket also we started with the scallop but no photo to show lol they were really good the drink i ordered wa the kingston and it really wa like drink very fruity and strong he ordered the old fashion really liked it they are changing their menu for the season so we are excited to see what they add had issac a a server and man doe he know everything there s not an question that could throw him off well got to say i m not much of a rum drinker but this is a place to eat that too drink wife and i came here a a farewell dinner before we return home from visiting az you got to get the house rum drink nice with pleasant taste and smooth if weather is nice eat outside to enjoy good food and nice caribbean music also splendid service by the staff mmmmm breadfruit n nyour jerk chicken plate is awesome a full plate to stimulate the palate grilled pinapple for the smoky sweetness cole slaw for the acid jerk rub on the chicken for the spicy juice chicken for the savory a bread stick for the crispy and salty n nreally a fantastic dish my chicken wasn t dry at all i ll be back for dinner and will be bringing a bottle of wine with me a well the drink were great but very expensive wa very disappointed with three out of four meal the food is really not that great jerk chicken game hen wa not very flavorable nor wa the jerk pork the small plate of pepper shrimp wa good be prepared to spend a lot if you want more than one drink went there by recommendation of the barista at the nearby fair trade coffee and wa very pleased n nstopped in to grab a quick lunch not sure exactly what i wa getting into the server wa quick to offer assistance drink recommendation when i ordered my food the vegan curry i asked for water instead of buying one of their exotic dish after a couple minute of the water not arriving i started to get annoyed but then it came out with my lunch which wa impressively fast fast enough that i completely forgave the slowness of the water n nthe food wa excellent i thoroughly enjoyed every bite and then it got better a woman a cook i believe came out and explained to me that it wa unique type of organic tofu that ha to be ordered directly from jamaica and one serving alone ha about gram of protein in it she wa very friendly and very pleased to hear that i wa enjoying my meal and our short conversation made me enjoy it even more n noh and they allow you to byob too just one per person but that s still pretty awesome in my opinion very cool place rum old fashioned is dangerously tasty would have given five star if the jerk chicken wasn t made with cornish hen it tasted awesome but the effort to get meat of those little bone wa a bit much butter bean app wa very good too will be back i ve had mixed experience at the breadfruit rum bar before but this last one ha pushed me to the maybe come for drink but definitely not food category n nthe problem is the service and the speed at which the food come out now i understand if the restaurant is busy that it may take the kitchen a little longer to get the order out but to wait hour before any food hit the table is beyond ridiculous the waitress never kept u abreast a to what the hold up wa and we had to hunt her down in order to find out what happened to our order when we finally got to her she went and checked with the kitchen and said it d be more minute more than minute later the food came this situation could have easily been handled by a letting u know that the kitchen wa very backed up and b offering to bring u something to eat in the interim neither of those thing happened so we were left twiddling our thumb in hunger for waaaaay too long by the time the food finally arrived everyone wa a bit cranky so the joy of the atmosphere had been spoiled n nit s really too bad because the food once you actually get it is actually quite good we had the guava pork belly red curry shrimp and jerk pork and all were quite delicious same go for the drink if you re a rum fan and particularly a caribbean rum fan then you will absolutely love the cocktail menu they even serve a rum punch of the day which the bartender change daily so that is always fun n ni wish we had had a better service experience at the breadfruit but ala it wa not to be had and without a beach view to distract me from the unnecessarily long wait for food this ha pushed me overboard and is probably the final time we visit the island food at the rum bar '"
